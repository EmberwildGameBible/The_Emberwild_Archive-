The Emberwild Profession System

This appendix defines all professions, all material tiers, and the full crafting logic used in Emberwild.

Professions must obey:

- Slow, Classic-style progression
- No randomized affixes
- No infinite scaling
- No modern convenience systems
- No breaking class identity

Everything crafted is predictable, slow, grounded, and meaningful.

---

# D.1 PURPOSE OF PROFESSIONS

Professions exist to:

- Provide essential consumables
- Create gear progression alternatives
- Support the economy through gold sinks
- Reward exploration and world knowledge
- Tie recipes to world threats (Normal → Rare → Elite → Rare Elite → Boss)
- Create long-term mastery paths

Professions must not:

- Outclass Boss loot
- Provide superior gear to dungeon drops
- Become mandatory for power progression

Crafting is support, not dominance.

---

# D.2 MATERIAL TIERS (FINAL)

Every profession pulls from the same material rarity structure to keep the entire game consistent.

### Tier 0 — Basic Materials

- Used for Levels 1–15 crafting.

Examples:

- Tattered Hide
- Lowland Ore

---

### Tier 1 — Standard Materials

- Dropped by Normal & Rare enemies; found in most nodes across early/mid zones.
- Rest of the world uses these as baseline crafting ingredients.

Examples:

- Huntmaster Leather
- Ironwood Fiber
- Copper-Steel Ore
- Bitterbloom Petals

Used for Levels 15–30 recipes.

### Tier 5 — Ultra-Rare Materials

- Ultra-low chance from ANY node, boss, creature, fishing, cooking, or world exploration.
- Uses the global 1-of-X system to track how many exist server-wide.
- Power modest—only +5–8% better than elite tiers, mainly cosmetic or niche.

Examples:
