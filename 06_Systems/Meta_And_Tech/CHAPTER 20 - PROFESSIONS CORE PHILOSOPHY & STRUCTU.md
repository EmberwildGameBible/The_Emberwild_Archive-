# CHAPTER 20 — PROFESSIONS: CORE PHILOSOPHY & STRUCTURE

---

This chapter defines the global rules, identity, and Classic-inspired limitations of Emberwild’s profession system before any specific profession (Blacksmithing, Skinning, Cooking, etc.) is written.

This is the foundation for all profession chapters that follow (21–28).

No modern systems.

No crafting “rating.”

No daily cooldown spam.

No infinite convenience.

Only Classic-style depth, scarcity, long-term investment, and player-driven economy.

---

# 20.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

To establish:

- How professions work
- What every player can and cannot learn
- Required tools, stations, and materials
- Global economic role
- Ultra-Rare profession items
- Recipe acquisition
- Profession leveling structure
- Server-wide economy logic

Professions are designed as a pillar system:

Slow, meaningful, communal, and essential to the economy and gameplay loop.

---

# 20.1 CORE DESIGN PILLARS (PROFESSIONS)

### 1. Classic-Style Scarcity

Professions must:

- Be slow to level
- Require travel and exploration
- Create interdependence
- Require other professions indirectly
- Make crafted goods valuable for months

### 2. No Universal Crafting

Players must choose:

- One primary profession
- One secondary profession
- Gathering professions do not count toward primary slots

This ensures trade is necessary.

### 3. Recipe Discovery Is Content

Profession progression is driven by:

- Trainer recipes
- Rare world drops
- Ultra-Rare profession tomes
- Dungeon drops
- Reputation-based recipes
- World boss special recipes

### 4. Crafting Tools & Stations Matter

Crafting requires:

- The correct tool (skin knife, hammer, fishing rod, etc.)
- The correct workstation (forge, tanning rack, alchemy table, campfire)
- Materials that must be gathered—not purchased infinitely

Travel friction is part of the loop.

### 5. Economic Weight

Crafting supports:

- Consumables
- Gear upgrades
- Enhancement items
- Ammo
- Bags
- Cooking buffs
- Profession-only utilities

The economy depends on these.

### 6. No Scaling Craft Systems

Crafting output is static, not level-scaled:

- A crafted Tier 1 sword is always Tier 1
- A Tier 4 cooking recipe remains powerful
- No “automatically scaling items” like modern MMOs

---

# 20.2 PROFESSION SLOTS

Each character can have:

### Primary Professions (Choose 1)

These create usable gear or enhancements.

Examples:

- Blacksmithing
- Leatherworking
- Woodcrafting
- Engineering
- Alchemy
- Enchanting
- Tailoring

### Secondary Professions (Choose 1)

Utility professions:

- Cooking
- Fishing
- First Aid (if included)
- Survival/Hunting Prep (optional)

### Gathering Professions (Unrestricted)

No limit on gathering professions:

- Mining
- Herbalism
- Skinning
- Logging
- Foraging

Players may take all gathering skills to support themselves, but only 1 primary + 1 secondary profession.

---

# 20.3 PROFESSION LEVEL BANDS

All professions follow Classic-tier structure:

### Novice (1–75)

Basic items

Basic mats

Trainer-only recipes

### Apprentice (75–150)

Intermediate mats

Zone-specific resources

Some rare drops

### Journeyman (150–225)

Regional specialties

More expensive materials

Travel required

### Expert (225–300)

High-tier items

Dungeon recipes

Rare resource nodes

### Master (300–375)

(If Emberwild level cap is 60, cap ~300. If level cap 70+, cap ~375.)

Ultra-rare recipes

Late-game consumables

Boss-tier enhancements

Emberwild’s level cap decides final tier—system supports both.

---

---

# 20.6 CRAFTING PROCESS & REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Correct Tool

Examples:

- Forge

### 3. Skill Requirement

Recipe requires:

- Minimum profession skill
- Some require “tool level” (basic / improved tools)

### 4. Travel Integration

Many stations are only found:

- In major towns
- In faction camps
- Near dungeons

The world is part of the craft.

---

# 20.7 ULTRA-RARE PROFESSION SYSTEM

Chance from:

- Rare mobs
- Some trash mobs
- Fishing
- Cooking
- Foraging
- Mining
- Skinning
- Herbalism

0.0001% → 0.01%

### Resulting Crafts

Slightly stronger (5%).

- 1 bonus socket
- 1 customizable modifier
- A unique flavor effect
- Region-specific visual

Ultra-Rare crafts are NOT guaranteed from Ultra-Rare materials—recipes needed.

---

# 20.8 INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN PROFESSIONS

Professions intentionally lean on others:

- Blacksmithing requires Mining + Woodcrafting for hafts
- Leatherworking requires Skinning + Alchemy oils
- Alchemy requires Herbalism + Fishing (oils)
- Cooking requires Fishing + Hunting
- Engineering requires Mining + Woodcrafting + Leatherworking scraps
- Enchanting requires disenchanting crafted or dropped items

Nothing is isolated.

Trade is essential.

---

# 20.9 ANTI-AUTOMATION & ANTI-SPAM RULES

To preserve Classic scarcity:

- No mass crafting without components
- No “queue 200 crafts”
- No automated macro-based production
- No infinite vendor loop materials
- No “gather while mounted” convenience

Crafting must feel like work.

---

# 20.10 DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

All future profession chapters must obey:

- No modern power creep
- No “free stats” from professions
- No scaling gear
- No infinite fishing spots
- No cheap mats
- No universal tools
- No teleports
- No instanced crafting rooms
- All recipes must fit the world’s zone tiers
- Ultra-Rare system applies globally

This is the backbone of Emberwild crafting.
