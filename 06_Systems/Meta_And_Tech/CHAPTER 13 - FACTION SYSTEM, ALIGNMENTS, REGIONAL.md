# CHAPTER 13 — FACTION SYSTEM, ALIGNMENTS, REGIONAL REPUTATIONS & NPC BEHAVIORS

---

Classic WoW had:

- Factions
- Reputation tiers
- Vendors
- Guards
- Unique perks for hitting higher standings

Emberwild needs its own version — realistic, grounded, hunting-RPG aligned, not political, not faction warfare, but ecology + regional trust + settlement loyalty.

This chapter becomes the foundation for:

- Crafting unlocks
- Vendor recipes
- Travel access
- Settlement defenses
- Bounties
- Perks
- World immersion
- Social progression
- NPC reactions

Proceeding now.

# CHAPTER 13 — FACTIONS, REPUTATION & NPC ALIGNMENT

Emberwild’s world is shaped not by nations, but by settlements, clans, orders, guilds, tribes, and spiritual circles.

Reputation is slow, Classic-style, and meaningful.

---

# 13.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

This chapter defines:

- All faction types
- Reputation tiers and rewards
- How players gain/lose reputation
- How NPCs react to different standings
- How settlements evolve as reputation rises
- Vendor unlocks, crafting benefits, travel perks
- Integration with professions, world events, and creatures

Nothing may contradict Chapter 13 once established.

---

# 13.1 REPUTATION TIERS (CLASSIC-STYLE)

Fixed, permanent tiers:

1. Hated
2. Hostile
3. Unfriendly
4. Neutral
5. Friendly
6. Honored
7. Revered
8. Exalted

Reputation is gained slowly and deliberately, mirroring Classic WoW’s pacing.

---

# 13.2 FACTION CATEGORIES

There are five faction archetypes in Emberwild:

---

## A. Settlements (Primary Factions)

Each Heritage homeland contains multiple settlements:

- Villages
- Outposts
- Trade hubs
- Hunter lodges
- Frontier stations

These factions give:

- Crafting recipes
- Gear vendors
- Travel conveniences
- Stables
- Regional perks
- Housing/cosmetic unlocks

Examples:

- Pinewatch Lodge (Forester homeland)
- Frostveil Station (Tundra)
- Ridgehorn Outpost (Highlands)
- Marshlight Encampment (Swamp)

---

## B. Regional Clans & Tribes

Small-scale survival groups scattered across the world:

- Beast-hunting clans
- Spirit-watching tribes
- Foragers and herbalist circles

Offer:

- Unique profession bonuses
- Rare materials
- Small defensive tools
- Wilderness utilities

---

## C. Crafting Orders

These factions are tied directly to professions:

- Artificers
- Leatherworkers
- Herbalist circles
- Forager guilds
- Fisher collectives
- Stonecutters
- Wayfinder cartographers

Provide:

- High-tier recipes
- Ultra-Rare material refinement
- Blueprints
- The ability to craft specialized gear slots

---

## D. Spirit Realm Societies

These are not playable races; they are metaphysical alliances:

- Spirit Watcher Order
- Echo Wardens
- Lantern-Tenders
- Balance-Keepers

They grant:

- Spirit visibility
- Specific reagents
- Travel between spirit fissures
- Spirit-related profession materials

---

## E. Hostile Factions

Enemy groups with fixed hostility:

- Bandit clans
- Corrupted beast covens
- Rogue spirit entities
- Marauders
- Poacher camps

These never go above Unfriendly, and most remain Hostile.

Killing them grants reputation with civilized settlements.

---

# 13.3 REPUTATION ACQUISITION

Reputation is earned deliberately and slowly:

### Primary Sources

- Completing settlement quests
- Delivering profession goods
- Clearing hostile pockets
- Helping defense events
- Hunting region-specific threats
- Crafting delivery contracts
- Spirit realm stabilization

### Secondary Sources

- Killing marked enemies
- Discovering hidden shrines
- Escort missions
- Regional challenges
- Cooking/foraging donations

### No trivial farming

No faction can be spam-leveled through infinite farmable mobs.

Every faction uses Classic-style diminishing returns for mob reputation.

---

# 13.4 REPUTATION REWARDS

Each faction tier unlocks new features:

### Friendly

- Basic profession recipes
- Improved vendor stock
- Slight travel discounts
- Storage access (bank-like)

---

# 13.5 NPC BEHAVIOR BASED ON REPUTATION

NPCs change dialogue, prices, and services depending on your standing.

### Unfriendly / Hostile

- Merchants refuse service
- Travel options disabled

---

# 13.6 FACTION INTERACTIONS WITH WORLD SYSTEMS

### Professions

- Recipes gated behind factions
- Ultra-Rare material processing tied to certain groups
- Profession Master quests require faction standings

### Rare Hunting

- Some Rare Elites require faction favor to track or reveal
- Settlement hunters provide hints only to friendly+

### Housing / Lodges

- Exalted with your homeland unlocks your personal Lodge
- This becomes cross-character shared (Heritage Lodge)
- Matches Emberwild’s endgame philosophy (Chapter 1 & 9 references)

### Travel

- Ferries, sled routes, ridge lifts, swamp skiffs, dune skimmers
- Unlocked by faction tiers
- Never instant-global travel

### Spirit Realm

- Only spirit societies offer spirit-path access
- Reputation ties directly to your ability to traverse unstable zones

---

# 13.7 REPUTATION PENALTIES

Classic-style negative reputation rules:

- Killing innocent wildlife does NOT lower rep
- Killing faction-protected beasts DOES
- Helping hostile factions lowers rep with civilized factions
- Spirit realm violations anger spirit groups
- Poaching, theft, or failing public events lowers regional trust

These punishments are small but noticeable.

---

# 13.8 FACTION CROSS-PROGRESSION

Each Heritage has:

- 1 homeland primary faction
- 2–3 regional sub-factions
- 1 crafting-related order
- 1 spirit-related order (optional)

Players can max ALL factions over time, but it is intentionally slow.

No “choose one permanently” restrictions.

No faction wars.

Pure Classic-style progression.

---

# 13.9 DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

All faction content must obey:

1. Classic-style pacing
2. No scaling reputation
3. No catch-up shortcuts
4. No automated travel
5. No instant exalted
6. No “battle pass” systems
7. Must tie into survival, hunting, crafting, and exploration
8. Must reinforce world identity
