# CHAPTER 7 — ITEMIZATION & LOOT SYSTEM (FINAL)

---

Understood.

Here is CHAPTER 7 — ITEMIZATION & EQUIPMENT SYSTEM (FINAL REWRITE)

Fully rebuilt from zero, perfectly aligned with:

- The only valid enemy tiers
    
    Normal / Rare / Elite / Rare Elite / Boss (+ optional Mini-Boss)
    
- The Ultra-Rare Hybrid Model (C)
- Your Classic-style world, loot pacing, and equipment systems

# CHAPTER 7 — ITEMIZATION & EQUIPMENT SYSTEM (FINAL)

### Emberwild: Classic-Style Gear, Drops, Stat Budgets, and World Distribution

This chapter defines every rule governing gear, world drops, rarity tiers, Ultra-Rares, armor slots, equipment progression, and drop logic.

Nothing in any future content can contradict this chapter.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

Itemization must:

- Feel grounded
- Feel slow, rewarding, and Classic-style
- Fit within Emberwild’s world-danger philosophy
- Reflect class identity & weapon restrictions
- Support the economy
- Be predictable enough for theorycraft
- Always respect rarity identity and loot pacing

Gear is progression.

Gear is narrative.

Gear is world identity.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.1 EQUIPMENT SLOTS (FULL & FINAL)

All player gear slots are:

### Armor Slots (8)

1. Head
2. Shoulders
3. Chest
4. Wrists
5. Hands
6. Waist
7. Legs
8. Feet

### Jewelry (2)

1. Neck
2. Ring (two slots optional — design TBD, but Classic uses two)

### Accessories (2–3, game-defined)

1. Trinket 1
2. Trinket 2
3. Charm / Lantern / Totem / Off-Hand Focus / Quiver
    
    (This slot varies by class depending on identity.)
    

### Weapon Set

1. Main-Hand
2. Off-Hand / Shield / Tome / Focus
3. Ranged Weapon (Bow / Gun / Crossbow / Throwing)

If class does not use ranged, this becomes a stat tool slot.

Ammo is separate.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.2 ARMOR TYPES & CLASS LIMITS

Armor types strictly follow Classic-style progression:

- Cloth (universal, always equippable)
- Leather
- Mail
- Plate

### Class ceilings are permanent.

If a class’s schema says “max Leather,” it can NEVER wear Mail or Plate.

### Armor availability timing

- Cloth: Level 1
- Leather: Level 1 or via trainer (class-based)
- Mail: Midgame unlock (20–30 range)
- Plate: Only heavy classes at 40+

Nothing ever overrides these limits.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.3 ITEM RARITY TIERS (FINALIZED)

### Common

- White/gray items
- Vendor trash or basic functional gear

### Uncommon

- Green-quality
- Normal world drops / basic crafted items
- Typical leveling gear

### Rare

- Blue-quality
- Strong leveling/early endgame gear
- Dungeon drops / Rare Elite drops

### Epic

- True endgame gear
- Boss loot / advanced crafting / high reputation

### Ultra-Rare

### 

### (New permanent category — Ultra-Rare)

- Extremely low drop rate (1-in-50k to 1-in-1M)
- Parent-line variants of existing world gear
- +3–5% stat bonus
- Unique tint/name
- Sometimes one minor optional stat swap
- NEVER required for meta/normal progression
- Always exciting, never mandatory

Ultra-Rare items DO NOT form their own armor set.

They are variants of existing items.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.4 GEAR STAT BUDGET SYSTEM

Every item has a total “budget” derived from:

- Required level
- Rarity
- Item type (weapon/armor)
- Slot (Chest has more budget than Wrists)

### 7.4.1 Level Bands (Example)

| Level Band | Base Budget |
| --- | --- |
| 1–10 | Very Low |
| 11–20 | Low |
| 21–30 | Moderate |
| 31–40 | Strong |
| 41–50 | High |
| 51–60 | Very High |

### 7.4.2 Rarity Modifiers

| Rarity | Budget Multiplier |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 1.0× |
| Uncommon | 1.25× |
| Rare | 1.75× |
| Epic | 2.25× |
| Ultra-Rare | +3–5% above Epic parent item |

### 7.4.3 Slot Weighting

Chest → Highest

Legs → High

Head/Shoulders/Hands/Feet → Mid

Wrists/Waist → Low

Rings/Neck/Trinkets → Compact but potent

Weapons use separate weapon-DPS budgets from Chapter 4.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.5 WORLD DROPS (NORMAL → RARE ELITE)

### 7.5.1 Normal Enemies

- Drop Common/Uncommon
- Very rare chance for recipes
- Very small chance for Ultra-Rare variants (only certain families)

### 7.5.2 Rare Enemies

- Guaranteed Rare item (or better)
- Small chance at Epic (low)
- Can drop Ultra-Rares at “creature-family bracket”
- Always drop flavor/lore items
- Always drop something useful

### 7.5.3 Elite Enemies

- Strong Rares
- Small chance at Epic
- Good chance at profession reagents
- Moderate chance at unique drops

### 7.5.4 Rare Elite

- Mini-boss tier
- Drop tables tuned like mini-dungeon bosses
- High chance for Epic
- Named drops
- Creature-family Ultra-Rare bracket enabled
- Strong source of special reagents

### 7.5.5 Boss

- Guaranteed Epic
- Multiple loot slots
- Always drops at least 1–2 fixed items
- Dungeon bosses have curated tables, not random soup
- World bosses have:
    - Large tables
    - Strong Rares
    - Guaranteed Epic
    - Tiny chance for Ultra-Rare per kill

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.6 CRAFTED ITEMS VS DROPPED ITEMS

Crafting follows Classic pacing:

### 7.6.1 Crafted Uncommon

- Baseline leveling gear
- Matches world Uncommon
- Cheap and accessible

### 7.6.2 Crafted Rare

- Requires rare reagents
- Often matches dungeon Rares for power
- Niche/stat specialization possible

### 7.6.3 Crafted Epic

- Requires boss mats
- Reputation-gated
- Long-term crafts (weeks/months)
- Competitive with endgame dungeon/raid loot

### 7.6.4 Ultra-Rare Craft Procs

Some professions (Weaponsmithing, Armorsmithing, Bowyer, Cooking) can proc a perfect craft, extremely rare:

- 1-in-100k to 1-in-250k
- Creates an Ultra-Rare variant of the item crafted
- Always follows parent-line rules
- Never breaks crafting balance

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.7 AMMUNITION SYSTEM (CORRECTED & FINAL)

- Ammo items have their own level requirement
- Player MUST meet ammo level to use it
- Ammo always contributes damage based on quality/tier
- Guns, bows, crossbows share identical logic
- High-level ammo CANNOT be used at low levels
- Some Ultra-Rare ammo patterns exist (tiny chances)

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.8 TREASURE, CHESTS & NON-COMBAT LOOT

### 7.8.1 Treasure Chests

- Fixed spawn tables
- Always contain some gold + items
- Rare chance for profession recipes
- Rare chance for Epic
- Extremely tiny chance for Ultra-Rare

### 7.8.2 Fishing Loot

- Strongest non-combat Ultra-Rare source
- Location + bait + time-of-day dependent
- Can produce Ultra-Rare “Artifact Trinkets,” “Lost Tools,” “Sunken heirlooms,” etc.

### 7.8.3 Foraging

- Ultra-Rare nature items (1-in-X brackets)
- Used for high-end alchemy/tinkering recipes

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.9 ULTRA-RARE ITEM SYSTEM

Ultra-Rares must obey ALL:

### 7.9.1 Hybrid Model (C)

- Global bracket: 1-in-50k to 1-in-1M
- Each creature/node picks ONE bracket
- Chance only triggers on valid drop events
- Global tracking: optional metadata stored (how many exist)

### 7.9.2 Parent-Line Variant

Ultra-Rare = essentially the “ancestral” / “perfect lineage” variant of an existing item family:

- +3–5% stat bump
- Slight color shift
- Unique flavor text
- Optional minor stat-twist (ex: +5 STA instead of +4 STA)
- NEVER mandatory
- NEVER meta-breaking
- ALWAYS special

### 7.9.3 Creature Family Identity

Every Ultra-Rare is tied to a family:

- Wolf family → Wolfline Ultra-Rares
- Bandit family → Brigand’s Ultra-Rares
- Mire Lizards → Mireborn Ultra-Rares
- Fishing → Lost/Ancient Ultra-Rares
- Treasure Caches → Explorer’s Ultra-Rares

### 7.9.4 Ultra-Rares do NOT create a new progression tier

Epic → endgame

Ultra-Rare → flavor find with slightly elevated stats & cosmetic identity

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.10 FUTURE DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

Any new loot in Emberwild must obey:

1. No new armor types
2. No new enemy tiers beyond:
    - Normal
    - Rare
    - Elite
    - Rare Elite
    - Boss
    - Mini-Boss (optional)
3. Ultra-Rare follows Hybrid Model only
4. Loot tables must be handcrafted, not random soup
5. Item budgets and class ceilings are sacred
6. Ammo level gating is mandatory
7. Boss loot is curated, not RNG chaos
8. World drops must respect family identity and zone flavor
