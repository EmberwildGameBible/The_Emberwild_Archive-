# Shatterglass Crypt — Loot Tables

**Origin/Provenance:** Compiled from Riverwatch oath challengers who survived the Crypt trials.

**Cultural Tie:** Entries are marked with oath ribbons and mirror etchings passed between duelists and Glimmerdeep traders.

**Gameplay Hook:** Focuses on reflect-heavy gear, mirror-phase boss drops, and utility crafting for crystal-infused resist prep.
