# Burn Scar Descent — Loot Tables

**Origin/Provenance:** Freight guard manifests compiled after the first slag convoys descended the vents.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford line-holders and Riverwatch scouts annotate the tables with soot marks showing where vents flare.

**Gameplay Hook:** Highlights signature drops tied to vent mechanics, a slag-runner set for bridge control, and utility pulls for freight teams.
