# Ashen_Cry_Grotto

**Origin/Provenance:** Cave complex below Frostbriar Reach exposed by ash vent collapses; first mapped by Windbreak sappers.

**Cultural Tie:** Ashbound cultists claim it as a “mouth of old fire,” while Shiverhook scouts see it as a hazard to seal before it vents smoke into their slides.

**Gameplay Hook:** Classic 5-player crawl mixing cold and fire hazards; drops rope and lantern-themed gear and keys tied to Frostbriar and Glimmerdeep events.

**Layout Notes:**
- Entry via Slidecaller bell caches or Ash Vent hollows in Glimmerdeep.
- Frozen galleries with brittle bridges over ash vents.
- Central ashfall chamber where cultists chant, leading to ember-lit sanctum.
