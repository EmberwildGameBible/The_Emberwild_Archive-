# Hollowroot Warren — Loot Tables

**Origin/Provenance:** Riverwatch pathfinders pooled their Warren scouting notes after the first spore flare season.

**Cultural Tie:** Glimmerdeep pole-walkers annotate fungus growth rings while Hollowroot clans trace kin-spirals next to boss names.

**Gameplay Hook:** Showcases spore-control gear, sound-based boss drops, and utility mats that feed regional professions.

## Mini Set — Rootbound Mycelium (3 pieces)

| Item | Slot | Drops From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Rootbound_Sporeveil](../../08_Items/Gear/Rootbound_Sporeveil.md) | Head | Glass Sentinel |

| [Rootbound_Warden_Greaves](../../08_Items/Gear/Rootbound_Warden_Greaves.md) | Legs | Ashbound Forgemaw |

**Set bonus:** (2) Increased spore cloud detection and damage reduction versus cone attacks; (3) Sprint that triggers heals when interrupting marked targets.
