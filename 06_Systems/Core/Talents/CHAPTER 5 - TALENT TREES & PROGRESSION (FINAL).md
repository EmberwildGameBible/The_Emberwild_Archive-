# CHAPTER 5 — TALENT TREES & PROGRESSION (FINAL)

Emberwild: Classic-Era Tree Structure, 54-Point System

This chapter defines:

- Talent tree geometry
- How points are earned
- How trees unlock
- How branching, deep points, and capstones work
- How respecs, hybridization, and class identity are enforced
- How all classes maintain balance under the Classic hybrid-tax philosophy

No ability, class, or future design may break these rules.

⸻

## 5.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

The talent tree system is one of Emberwild’s core progression pillars.

It provides:

- Long-term character identity
- Branching specialization
- High stakes, high permanence
- Deep Classic-style math and scaling
- A slow, high-investment journey

The system is built around three trees per class, of which only two may ever be fully developed.

⸻

# 5.1 TALENT POINT EARNING MODEL (54 POINTS)

### Total Points: 54

Talent points are awarded as follows:

- Levels 1–6: 0 points
- Level 7: 1 point
- Levels 8–9: 0 points
- Levels 10–60: 1 point per level (51 points)

Total = 54 talent points by Level 60.

This count is final and non-negotiable.

⸻

# 5.2 TALENT TREE GEOMETRY (9 TIERS)

Each class has three independent talent trees.

Each tree contains:

- 9 vertical tiers
- Multiple horizontal branches
- 1 capstone at Tier 9

Tier unlocks require total points invested in that specific tree, not points spent globally.

### Tier Unlock Requirements

| Tier | Points Required in Tree |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 points |
| 2 | 5 points |
| 3 | 10 points |
| 4 | 15 points |
| 5 | 20 points |
| 6 | 25 points |
| 7 | 30 points |
| 8 | 35 points |
| 9 (Capstone Tier) | 40 points |

The 40-point capstone rule is absolute.

⸻

# 5.3 TALENT TYPES (RANKED, SINGLE, KEYSTONE)

Talents fall into three categories:

### 1. Ranked Talents (1–5 ranks)

Provide small, incremental numerical bonuses.

Examples:

- +1–5% crit
- +2–10% damage to a skill family
- +3–15% resource efficiency

These define baseline tree shaping.

### 2. Single-Rank Talents

High-impact effects with one rank.

Examples:

- New active ability
- New passive mechanic
- Mobility or control addition

### 3. Capstone Talents (Tier 9)

The defining ability or passive of the specialization.

Rules:

- Requires 40 points in the tree
- Only one capstone per tree
- Cannot be accessed by accident or hybridizing loosely
- Always a major identity-defining feature

⸻

# 5.4 DUAL-TREE COMMITMENT MODEL

Every class has three trees but may only fully master two.

This follows strict Classic logic adapted for Emberwild.

### Rules:

1. You may invest in any tree at any time.
2. Capstones require 40 points in one tree.
3. With 54 points total, you can:
    - 40 in Tree A + 14 in Tree B
    - 40 in Tree B + 14 in Tree A
    - 31/23 split (deep hybrid)
    - 27/27 hybrid evenly
4. You cannot achieve two capstones simultaneously (requires 80 points).
5. Your third tree will always remain partially or lightly invested.

### Design Intent:

- Forces identity without hard-locking creativity
- Creates meaningful tradeoffs
- Prevents “everything builds”
- Keeps hybrids in check via point scarcity

⸻

# 5.5 RESPEC COST STRUCTURE

Respeccing talent points uses Classic-style escalating gold cost.

### Rules:

- First respec = low cost
- Each subsequent respec increases by a fixed multiplier
- Caps at a high value
- Resets weekly or at major events (optional, design dependent)

### Goal:

- Prevent casual flipping
- Preserve the weight of your build
- Encourage planning, commitment, and identity

⸻

# 5.6 HOW TALENT TREES INTEGRATE WITH COMBAT MATH

All talent values must obey:

- AP/14 weapon scaling rules
- Armor mitigation formula
- Hit/spell hit tables
- Crit chance formulas
- Resource regen equations
- Positional rules
- Weapon skill bonuses
- Threat multipliers
- Spirit-based regen
- Stamina → HP scaling
- AGI → dodge/crit scaling
- INT → mana/focus pool and spell crit scaling

Talent bonuses may not override or bypass fundamental combat math.

### Prohibited Talent Effects:

- “Ignore weapon skill penalties”
- “Cannot miss”
- “Bypass glancing blows”
- “Ignore armor formula” (unless tiny % during cooldowns)
- “No GCD” on offensive abilities
- “No threat generation” except for specific class-identity utility

Talents may modify math, but may not delete math.

⸻

# 5.7 TALENTS MUST RESPECT CLASS SCHEMAS (CH.1 & CH.3)

Talents may not:

- Add new weapon families
- Add new armor types
- Increase armor ceiling
- Add ranged or melee proficiencies
- Remove dead zones
- Remove casting requirements
- Grant stealth, plate armor, or new resources to incompatible classes

Talent trees must reinforce identity, not violate it.

⸻

# 5.8 TALENT POWER BUDGETING

Each tier’s total power is designed so that:

- Tier 1–3: shaping, minor boosts, identity hints
- Tier 4–6: specialization commitment, synergy, large passives
- Tier 7–8: identity-defining power, class-defining mechanics
- Tier 9 (Capstone): pinnacle ability or passive

### Capstones are designed to be:

- Transformative
- Build-defining
- Not numerically bloated
- Synergistic with earlier tiers
- Balanced against hybrid tax

⸻

# 5.9 TALENT INTERDEPENDENCIES & BRANCH LOCKS

Some talents may require:

- A preceding talent on the same branch
- A specific number of points in earlier rows
- A prerequisite ability learned from trainers

Branch locks keep the tree coherent.

⸻

# 5.10 DESIGN CONSTRAINTS FOR ALL FUTURE CLASSES

Every class talent system must obey these constraints:

1. 9 tiers per tree
2. 40-point capstone
3. 54 total points
4. Three trees, two-tree mastery
5. Ranked + single-rank + capstone composition
6. Hybrid tax enforced via math, not arbitrary nerfs
7. No homogenization of roles
8. Trees reinforce class resource models
9. Trees must not grant prohibited mechanics
10. Every talent must interact cleanly with Chapter 2–4 math

If any future idea violates these rules, it must be rewritten or removed.

⸻

# 5.11 SUMMARY

The Emberwild talent system:

- Uses a 54-point, Classic-inspired structure
- Forces meaningful specialization
- Supports deep role identity
- Avoids homogenization
- Integrates tightly with all underlying math
- Mirrors Classic WoW’s permanence, depth, and theorycraft potential
- Is slow, deliberate, and weighty
- Is one of the pillars of Emberwild’s entire design

No class may break these laws.

No system may supersede this chapter.
