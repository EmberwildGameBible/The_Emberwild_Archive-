Emberwild: Leveling, Training, Ranks, Skill Progression, and Long-Term Character Growth

This chapter defines how characters grow from Level 1 to Level 60.

It governs XP pacing, skill ranks, trainer logic, weapon skill growth, profession scaling, and character power expectations.

If any class, item, quest, or system contradicts Chapter 9, Chapter 9 wins.

---

## 9.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

This chapter establishes:

- Leveling speed and XP structure
- Skill rank progression
- Class trainers and cost scaling
- Weapon skill growth rules
- Profession leveling
- Mount & travel progression
- Spellbook expansion pacing
- Long-term character development identity

This is the backbone of the “slow, deliberate Classic leveling experience” adapted to Emberwild.

# 9.1 LEVELING STRUCTURE

### 9.1.1 Level Cap

- Maximum Level: 60
- Levels 1–60 comprise the full progression curve.
- No post-cap leveling. Endgame advancement is horizontal (reputation, professions, rare hunting mastery) — not vertical power inflation.

### 9.1.2 XP Curve

- Follows a Classic-style exponential curve, where:
    - Levels 1–10 are fast
    - Levels 10–30 slow noticeably
    - Levels 30–50 are long
    - Levels 50–60 are extremely slow

Long-term pacing is intentional. Level 60 is a major achievement.

### 9.1.3 Sources of XP

Ranked importance:

1. Quests (Primary Source)
2. Creatures (Secondary Source)
3. Exploration Discoveries
4. Professions (Small Supplemental)
5. Rare / Elite Hunts
6. Dungeon Completion (Not Spammable; capped by travel)

This prevents grinding-only metas and enforces world exploration.

### 9.1.4 Grey Mob Penalty

- Creatures 6+ levels below player reward drastically reduced XP.
- Meant to keep world danger and progression aligned.

# 9.2 SKILL RANKS & TRAINER STRUCTURE

### 9.2.1 All Abilities Are Rank-Based

Every learnable combat ability has:

- Rank 1 (first obtained)
- Multiple higher ranks at:
    - Levels 4–6 apart
    - Increasing resource cost
    - Major damage/healing scaling

Rank progression mirrors Classic WoW’s structure.

### 9.2.2 Trainers Are Mandatory

You must visit your trainer to:

- Learn new abilities
- Learn new ranks
- Learn new armor proficiencies
- Learn allowed weapon proficiencies
- Unlearn talents (at escalating cost)
- Unlock class-specific mechanics

There are no auto-granted abilities except Auto Attack and Auto Shot.

### 9.2.3 Trainer Cost Curve

Ability training cost grows at a strict rate:

- Low at levels 1–10
- Noticeable at 20–40
- Expensive at 40–60

This:

- Reinforces gold scarcity
- Enforces choice
- Makes learning everything expensive

Skipping abilities is part of Classic design.

### 9.2.4 Rank Efficiency Philosophy

- Lower ranks are more resource-efficient
- Higher ranks are higher output

Classic downranking philosophy is supported:

- High ranks = burst
- Low ranks = efficiency/sustain

This allows skill expression and management.

---

# 9.3 WEAPON SKILL PROGRESSION

### 9.3.1 Maximum Weapon Skill

Max skill = 5 × character level

- Level 60 → 300 skill max per weapon family

### 9.3.2 Increasing Weapon Skill

Weapon skill increases by:

- Hitting valid mobs with that weapon type
- Faster at low skill
- Very slow near cap

This encourages:

- Using the weapons you want to specialize in
- Realistic character mastery

### 9.3.3 Weapon Skill Effect

Weapon skill affects:

- Miss chance
- Dodge / Parry / Block rates
- Glancing blow frequency
- Glancing blow damage penalty
- Threat stability for melee/ranged classes

Exactly Classic-style behavior.

---

# 9.4 CLASS ABILITIES, SPELLBOOK GROWTH & PACING

### 9.4.1 Spellbook Expansion

Characters learn:

- 1–3 new abilities every 2–4 levels
- New ranks every 4–6 levels

No ability bloat.

No modern-style ability flooding at early levels.

### 9.4.2 Power Curve Philosophy

Character strength increases via:

1. Level
2. Weapon skill
3. New ranks
4. Gear upgrades
5. Talent investment
6. Resource efficiency learning

The curve is slower than modern games.

Power comes from mastery, not spam.

### 9.4.3 Ability Categories

Abilities are grouped (always rank-based):

- Core Attacks
- Finishers
- Heals
- Control
- Survivability
- Mobility
- Class Mechanics (stances, forms, spirits, aspects, etc.)

Each category unlocks at defined level bands unique to each class.

---

# 9.5 TALENT POINT PROGRESSION

### 9.5.1 Talent Points

- Starting at Level 7, players gain 1 talent point per level.
- Total at level 60 = 54 talent points.
- Exactly two trees may be fully committed to.
- The third tree becomes permanently locked.

### 9.5.2 Tier Structure

Talent tiers unlock at:

- Tier 1 → 0 points
- Tier 2 → 5 points
- Tier 3 → 10 points
- …
- Tier 9 → 40 points (capstone unlock)

This is the Classic system.

### 9.5.3 No Dual Spec

Talent specialization is:

- Singular
- Persistent
- Respec cost increases each time

No modern convenience systems.

---

# 9.6 PROFESSIONS & LONG-TERM SKILLS

### 9.6.1 Profession Structure

Professions level from:

- 1 → 300 (Classic-style)
- Skill-up slows significantly after 225
- High-level crafts require rare materials
- Some crafts require reputation
- Some recipes require rare elites/dungeons

### 9.6.2 Profession Types

Each profession fits into:

- Gathering (Herbalism, Mining, Skinning)
- Crafting (Weaponsmithing, Armoring, Fletching, Alchemy, Cooking, Leatherworking, etc.)
- Utility (Tracking, trapping, etc.)

### 9.6.3 Profession Mastery

Professions matter:

- Ammunition
- Food
- Potions
- Armor
- Weapons
- Tools
- Buff items
- Camping/rest systems

Professions are a true alternative progression route — not optional fluff.

---

# 9.7 MOUNTS, TRAVEL & HUNTING GEAR

### 9.7.1 Mount Progression

Mount unlocks follow Classic pacing:

- Basic mount ~ Level 40
- Advanced mount ~ Level 60
- Mount fees are major gold sinks
- Mount training is expensive
- Mount speed is modest early on

No instant early-game mounts.

### 9.7.2 Travel Burdens

Travel includes:

- Stamina/Fatigue loss
- Ammo weight/consumption
- Food/water requirements
- Harsh terrain
- Zone danger scaling

Movement is a tactical decision.

### 9.7.3 Hunting Kit Progression

Players unlock:

- Better traps
- Better tracking
- Better lures
- Better baits
- Better lanterns/smoke/flares
- Better camp kits

These unlock via quests, professions, trainers, and reputation bands.

---

# 9.8 PLAYER POWER EXPECTATIONS THROUGH LEVELS

### 9.8.1 Early Game (1–15)

- Low survivability
- Limited toolkit
- High downtime
- Weapon upgrades extremely impactful
- Poor resource regeneration

The world is dangerous.

### 9.8.2 Mid Game (16–40)

- Class identity emerges
- More tools for control, pulls, healing
- Resource management becomes skill-based
- Travel becomes easier but still meaningful

Midgame is the core Emberwild experience.

### 9.8.3 Late Game (41–60)

- Talent synergies define actual “specs”
- Group roles become rigid
- Weapon skill caps start mattering
- Endgame zones are lethal
- High demand for Ammo, Consumables, Food, Repairs

Level 60 is powerful — but not invincible.

---

# 9.9 DEATH, REPAIRS & MAINTENANCE COSTS

### 9.9.1 Death Penalty

- Spirit run
- Durability loss
- Resource loss (time, food, ammo)

Death is a cost, not an annoyance.

### 9.9.2 Repair Costs

Repairs scale with:

- Item quality
- Item level
- Armor type
- Frequency of death/combat

Repairs anchor the economy.

---

# 9.10 DESIGN CONSTRAINTS FOR ALL FUTURE CONTENT

Any quest, NPC, class, item, dungeon, rare spawn, or expansion must obey:

1. Leveling never accelerates
2. Gold remains scarce
3. Training abilities always costs meaningful gold
4. Weapon skill cannot be bypassed
5. Talent points always follow 54-point cap
6. Mounts never come early
7. Professions always progress 1–300 Classic-style
8. Progression systems stay slow, grindy, and meaningful
9. No alternative progression invalidates this chapter

If any system attempts to break these rules, it is rejected.
