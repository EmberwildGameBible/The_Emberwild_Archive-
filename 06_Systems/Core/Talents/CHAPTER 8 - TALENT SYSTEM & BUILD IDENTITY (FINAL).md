# CHAPTER 8 — TALENT SYSTEM & BUILD IDENTITY (FINAL)

Emberwild: Classic-Style Talent Architecture

This chapter defines the complete ruleset for how talent trees, specialization identity, and long-term build decisions work in Emberwild.

Nothing in future content may contradict this chapter.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

The Emberwild talent system is a Classic-era, permanent-choice, identity-defining system built around:

- Slow, meaningful investment
- Tree depth over horizontal bloat
- Capstones that shape a class’s combat identity
- Permanent commitment to two out of three trees
- 54 total talent points
- 9 tiers per tree, gated by total points spent

This chapter establishes the mechanical structure used by every class.

Mathematical rules in Chapter 4 and class-specific rules in Chapters 9–20 must obey this chapter’s structure.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.1 TALENT SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The talent system is modeled on Classic WoW principles:

- 3 talent trees per class
- Players may fully commit to only 2 trees
- Third tree is permanently locked once selections are made
- Point-based depth gating — NOT node-chain gating
- 54 total talent points earned from Level 7 to 60

Each tree expresses a distinct identity:

1. Offense Tree – burst, damage, aggression, pressure
2. Defense/Support Tree – mitigation, healing, utilities, survival
3. Hybrid/Utility Tree – control, regeneration, mobility, special mechanics

Talent trees are not symmetrical; identity > balance.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.2 TALENT POINT AWARDING

### 8.2.1 Talent Unlock Level

- Talents begin at Level 7.

### 8.2.2 Talent Point Per Level

From Level 7 to 60:

- 1 talent point per level
- Levels 7 → 60 = 54 total points

This is a fixed, permanent rule for Emberwild.

### 8.2.3 No Additional Talent Points

No quests, items, or bonus systems ever award extra talent points.

### 8.2.4 No Account-Wide Unlocks

There are no boosts, skips, or cross-character sharing.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.3 TALENT TREE ACCESS

### 8.3.1 Three Trees Per Class (Permanent)

Every class has exactly three trees:

1. Tree A – Primary Offense
2. Tree B – Defense/Support
3. Tree C – Hybrid/Utility

### 8.3.2 Only Two Trees May Be Chosen

Players may only fully develop two trees.

The unchosen tree becomes permanently locked for that character.

### 8.3.3 The Selection Window (Permanent Lock-in)

The selection freeze occurs once ANY tree has 5 points invested or once the player reaches Level 14, whichever comes first.

After this moment:

- The remaining two trees stay unlocked
- The discarded tree cannot be accessed again

This prevents meta-swap gaming and enforces identity.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.4 TALENT TREE STRUCTURE

Every tree has 9 tiers, vertically aligned.

### 8.4.1 Tier Requirements (Points in THAT Tree)

| Tier | Points Required in Tree |
| --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | 0 points |
| Tier 2 | 5 points |
| Tier 3 | 10 points |
| Tier 4 | 15 points |
| Tier 5 | 20 points |
| Tier 6 | 25 points |
| Tier 7 | 30 points |
| Tier 8 | 35 points |
| Tier 9 (Capstone) | 40 points |

Capstones are major power-shaping abilities.

This structure ensures:

- Depth > breadth
- Commitment > mixing
- Clear late-game identity

──────────────────────────────

# 8.5 TOTAL POINTS & BUILD LIMITATIONS

### 8.5.1 Total Points = 54

Players have precisely 54 talent points at Level 60.

### 8.5.2 Capstone Investment Requirement

A player must spend 40 points in a single tree to unlock its Tier 9 ability.

Because they only have 54 points:

- They can go 40/14
- Or 31/23
- Or 27/27
- But never dual-capstone (40/40)

This is deliberate to:

- Force specialization
- Reinforce class identity
- Prevent homogenization

### 8.5.3 No Reset Without Cost

Resetting talents:

- Must be done at a trainer
- Costs gold
- Repeated resets increase in price
- Cannot be done infinitely without consequence

This preserves commitment and prevents meta abuse.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.6 TALENT NODE TYPES

Each talent node is one of the following:

### 8.6.1 Passive Talents

Stat increases, mitigation bonuses, skill improvements, or passive damage/healing bonuses.

### 8.6.2 Rank-Based Talents

Nodes with 1–5 ranks:

- Each rank adds value
- Unlocking the tier only requires total points spent, not maxing the node

### 8.6.3 Active Talents

New abilities, toggles, stances, or high-impact cooldowns.

Actives require careful cost/benefit tuning (Chapter 2 & 4 handle math).

### 8.6.4 Modifiers

Talents that modify existing abilities:

- Reduced cooldown
- Increased damage
- Added effects
- New interactions (but never breaking core class rules)

──────────────────────────────

# 8.7 BUILD ARCHETYPE EXPECTATIONS

Each class should have:

- At least 1 offensive-focused build
- At least 1 defensive/support build
- At least 1 hybrid/control/utility build

Choosing two trees defines the player’s build identity.

Internal balance targets:

- ±3–4% performance spread
- No tree dead
- No “mandatory” combinations unless identity-driven
- Hybrids trade DPS for utility/control

──────────────────────────────

# 8.8 TALENT DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

No talent can:

1. Introduce a new weapon family to a class
2. Increase armor above class maximum
3. Override core resources (Vitality, Focus, Current, Resolve)
4. Create infinite resource loops
5. Remove Classic-style friction (no infinite sprint, no perma-stealth, no “ignore threat”)
6. Bypass the hit table or weapon skill system
7. Functionally erase weaknesses that define class identity

If a talent violates Chapter 1, 2, or 4 — it is invalid.

──────────────────────────────

# 8.9 INTERNAL TALENT REVIEW SYSTEM

Before any class talent tree is finalized, it must pass:

### 8.9.1 Identity Review

Does the tree match the class’s role, weapon rules, and resource model?

### 8.9.2 Synergy Review

Do talents:

- Strengthen core loops?
- Avoid duplicating other trees?
- Support chosen weapon families?

### 8.9.3 Math Consistency Review

Does the talent obey:

- AP/14 scaling
- Ability coefficients
- Hit table integrity
- Resource costs
- Threat rules

### 8.9.4 Friction Review

Does the talent respect Emberwild’s slower, grounded pacing?

──────────────────────────────

# 8.10 SUMMARY: THE EMBERWILD TALENT LAW

- 3 trees per class
- Only 2 selectable
- 54 total points
- 9 tiers per tree
- 40-point capstones
- No expansions to weapon/armor identity
- No removal of friction
- No stat or threat-breaking gimmicks
- No homogenization
- Identity > balance
- Classic math is always obeyed

This is the final talent architecture Emberwild will use permanently.
