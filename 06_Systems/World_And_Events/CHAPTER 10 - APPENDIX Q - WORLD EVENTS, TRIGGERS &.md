# WORLD EVENTS & SERVER PULSES

Emberwild Game Bible v4.1 — COMPLETE REWRITE

This new version aligns with:

- your grounded realism
- new creature tiers
- no magic
- no supernatural events
- Classic WoW pacing
- RDR2 atmosphere
- your weather & spirit realm rewrites
- your world philosophy (slow, meaningful, believable)

This is now the canonical version of Emberwild’s event and pulse system.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# APPENDIX Q — WORLD EVENTS & SERVER PULSES

“Emberwild breathes. The land itself moves in quiet rhythms.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.0 — PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM

In Emberwild, events and pulses are NOT:

- magical invasions
- supernatural storms
- MMO-style boss spawns
- global announcements
- contrived “server-wide raids”

Instead, the event system simulates:

- wildlife cycles
- weather rhythm
- day/night variations
- migration movement
- caravan routes
- resource blooms
- audio cues
- seasonal changes
- realistic ecological shifts

These create a world that feels alive without ever breaking realism.

This appendix defines server-wide timers (pulses) and regional events that influence the world quietly and naturally.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.1 — WHAT IS A PULSE?

A Pulse is a lightweight server timer that updates:

- creature spawn rotations
- herb bloom/decay
- fishing hotspots
- scavenger behavior
- den/pack activity
- weather change evaluations
- spirit-echo refreshment
- caravan movement
- environmental soundscape

Pulses occur every:

- 30 seconds (minor updates)
- 5 minutes (moderate updates)
- 30 minutes (major world shifts)

They DO NOT cause dramatic or magical changes.

They simply advance environmental and wildlife logic.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.2 — TYPES OF PULSES

There are four types of pulses.

---

## 1. Micro Pulse (30 seconds)

Handles:

- local creature pathfinding
- herb decay
- minor tracking updates
- carcass decomposition stages
- campfire smoke spread
- shifting herd directions
- ambient audio changes

These pulses keep the world fluid without heavy computation.

---

## 2. Minor Pulse (5 minutes)

Handles:

- spawn repopulation checks
- scavenger dispatches
- herb growth
- small weather hints (cloud buildup)
- companion behavior adjustments
- fishing area activity shifts

Players feel these pulses subtly.

---

## 3. Major Pulse (30 minutes)

Handles:

- Rare + Elite spawn windows
- Rare Elite rotation logic
- Mini-boss spawn eligibility
- caravan departures/arrivals
- night/day wildlife handoff
- region-level audio changes
- forage bloom waves

This pulse drives the “heartbeat” of the wilderness.

---

## 4. Seasonal Pulse (Daily / Weekly / Biweekly)

Handles:

- season changes
- migration shifts
- major weather pattern adjustments
- region-wide resource changes
- slow, persistent world evolution

This is the largest kind of pulse but still grounded.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.3 — REGIONAL WILDLIFE EVENTS (REALISTIC)

Emberwild events are natural phenomena, not magical invasions.

Below are the core event categories.

---

## 1. Migration Events

Triggered by:

- seasons
- food scarcity
- snow onset
- heatwaves

Effects:

- herds relocate
- predators follow
- Rare creatures change territory
- tracking trails remain behind

---

## 2. Feeding Frenzy / Carcass Events

When a large predator kills prey:

- scavengers gather
- birds circle
- Rare scavengers appear
- noise attracts predators and hunters alike

These events are realistic and dynamic.

---

## 3. Weather-Driven Events

Weather triggers:

- shelter rush (creatures retreat to dens)
- fog ambush windows
- rain-driven herb blooms
- drought-based waterhole encounters

Not magical, just ecological.

---

## 4. Den / Nest Activity Events

Triggered by Major Pulses.

Effects:

- pack dens expand
- elite creatures leave dens
- new cubs appear (non-aggressive)
- older creatures become territorial

---

## 5. Soundscape Events

Triggered by:

- time of day
- season
- rare creatures nearby
- storms approaching

World audio shifts:

- wolves howl at moon phases
- frogs erupt before rain
- birds go silent before predators approach

This subtly alerts skilled players.

---

## 6. Caravan Arrival / Departure

NPC caravans rotate on Major Pulses:

- traders arrive at towns
- supply wagons depart
- rare merchant windows open
- roadside ambushes occur organically

Zero magical influence. Pure world simulation.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.4 — RARE CREATURE ROTATION SYSTEM

Rare, Elite, and Rare Elite creatures spawn based on Pulse windows, not RNG magic.

### RARE SPAWNS

- triggered during Major Pulses
- influenced by season and weather
- multiple possible spawn points
- low density
- predictable by skilled trackers

### ELITE SPAWNS

- tied to dens and pack structures
- spawn based on pack strength
- influenced by time of day
- stable and controlled

### RARE ELITE SPAWNS

- appear at high-tension ecosystem moments
- tied to:
    - pressure from predators
    - weather
    - seasonal changes
    - den expansions
    - migration paths

Their rotation is predictable, but only through signs and world-reading.

### MINI-BOSS SPAWNS

- gated by:
    - region tier
    - season
    - world event triggers
    - region danger level (via pulses)
- extremely rare
- tied to deep wilderness

Bosses remain dungeon-only.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.5 — RESOURCE & GATHERING EVENTS

The environment quietly shifts resources.

### 1. Herb Bloom Waves

Triggered by:

- rain → herb bloom
- snow melt → fungus outgrowth
- heat → desert flowering

### 2. Forage Cycles

- berries ripen on intervals
- roots emerge after storms
- mushrooms appear after fog

### 3. Fishing Hotspots

- rain improves bite rate
- fog stabilizes fish movement
- heat reduces shallow-water activity

These are subtle, discoverable patterns.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.6 — SPIRIT ECHO PULSES (NON-MAGICAL)

The Spirit Realm does NOT create events.

But Spirit echo visibility is affected by pulses.

### Echo refresh timing:

- minor echoes refresh on Minor Pulses
- deep echoes refresh on Major Pulses
- ancient echoes refresh on Seasonal Pulses

Echoes NEVER interact with gameplay.

They only enrich atmosphere and tracking.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.7 — PLAYER-FACING EVENT COMMUNICATION

Very important:

### No global announcements.

### No UI popups.

### No quest log spam.

### No screaming alerts.

Instead, players notice events through:

- sound cues
- visual changes
- creature behavior
- caravan movements
- herb growth
- water source activity
- footprints
- scavenger gatherings

This reinforces immersion and realism.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION Q.8 — DESIGN INTENT

World Events & Pulses exist to:

- make Emberwild feel alive
- reward experienced players
- create meaningful, realistic variability
- reinforce the grounded tone
- enhance tracking & hunting
- avoid MMO chaos
- support slow, deliberate gameplay
- bring the world to life without magic

The world should feel like it has its own rhythms, not like a theme-park with timed boss spawns.
