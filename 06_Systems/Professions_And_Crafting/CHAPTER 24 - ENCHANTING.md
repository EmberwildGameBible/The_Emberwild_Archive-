# CHAPTER 24 — ENCHANTING

### FULL PROFESSION BIBLE • EMBERWILD v4.3.5

### SECTION 1 — PROFESSION OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.1 PROFESSION FANTASY — THE ART OF BINDING

Enchanting is Emberwild’s purest expression of grounded ritual magic:

a discipline built not on flashy spells or conjured light, but on slow, dangerous, careful binding of essence into steel, cloth, hide, and wood.

It is:

- a high-cost, high-impact artisan craft
- a profession defined by scarcity, ritual, and precision
- tightly bound to item destruction, dustwork, and classic MMO disenchanting
- a long-term endgame pillar for gear enhancement and server economy stability

Enchanting is NOT:

- modern “crafting rating” spam
- bulk-mass crafting
- convenience alchemy
- high fantasy casting
- on-demand power

Instead, it follows Classic WoW DNA:

- slow
- expensive
- meaningful
- one enchant at a time
- each enchant a serious investment

Enchanting is the only profession that:

- destroys gear to gain materials
- permanently enhances another player’s equipment
- has global-scarcity tiers (Ultra-Rare Crystals)
- reflects true server progression
- retains value from level 1 → level 60 → postgame

Visually and thematically, enchanting in Emberwild is:

- grounded
- ritualistic
- rune-carved
- dust-driven
- essence-bound
- slow and patient

Nothing about it contradicts your world’s low-fantasy identity.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.2 ROLE WITHIN THE WORLD

Enchanting exists to fulfill three primary world functions:

### A. Permanent Gear Enhancement

Enchants:

- make armor feel personal
- make weapons feel “owned”
- add permanent character investment
- create Classic-era micro-stats that slowly add up

Enchants NEVER:

- replace dropped gear
- enable raid-breaking DPS spikes
- circumvent armor class rules
- bypass class identity

### B. Major Economic Sink

Enchanting is one of the largest gold sinks in Emberwild:

- rods
- inks
- parchments
- essences
- shards
- crystals
- player service fees
- travel costs
- failure-risk components

It is perfectly tuned for a slow economy.

### C. Gear Recycling Loop

Enchanting ties the entire loot ecosystem together:

```
Drop → Disenchant → Dust/Essence/Shards → Enchants → Stronger Players → Harder Hunts → Better Drops
```

A full closed MMO economy loop, exactly like Classic WoW.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.3 THEMATIC PILLARS

Enchanting is built on six identity pillars:

- Extraction — you break gear to harvest its magical potential
- Scarcity — shards and crystals are always rare
- Ritual — enchants require circles, inks, incense
- Precision — slow, careful, meaningful crafting
- Permanence — enchants last forever unless overwritten
- Cooperation — enchanters exist to serve the server community

This makes enchanting the ultimate “social craft.”

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.4 PLAYSTYLE OF THE PROFESSION

Enchanting’s “gameplay loop” feels like a miniature class identity:

### Low Level (1–75)

- You destroy more items than you craft
- Dust is common; essences feel exciting
- Everyone wants minor boots/chest enchants

### Mid Level (75–150)

- You travel frequently for vendors
- Rod upgrades become expensive
- Players begin seeking specific glove/cape enchants

### High Tier (150–225)

- Dungeon groups want your bracer/chest enchants
- Resist-based enchants become dungeon prerequisites
- Shards become your bottleneck

### Artisan Tier (225–300)

- You enter the prestige economy
- Only enchanters with Elder Alloy Rods can perform top-tier work
- Ultra-Rare Crystals create server-famous names
- Dungeon and rare creature recipes define your identity

This matches Classic WoW’s experience exactly.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.5 COMPARATIVE VALUE ACROSS LEVELS

Enchanting value spikes in line with:

- dungeon progression
- rare creature Hunts
- chest and bracer enchant tiers
- Ultra-Rare Crystal availability

### Value Curve (1–60):

- 1–10: Low economic return, training phase
- 11–25: High demand for minor passive enchants
- 26–40: Major market tier—resists, bracers, gloves
- 41–60: Ultra-Rare enchants + high-tier shard composites

Enchanting is intentionally back-loaded, giving the endgame real staying power.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.6 CLASS INTERACTIONS & ROLE SYNERGY

### Works extraordinarily well with:

- Priest — holy warding enchants, purification inks
- Witch — curse-breaking, binding rituals, essence hybrid use
- Warden — cloak/boot resist setups
- Hunter / Sand Strider — weapon hit/crit oils
- Frost Guard — resist enchants perfectly compliment tank play
- Highlander — armor-based wardings

### Moderate synergy with:

- Seaborn (mobility enchants)
- Mercenary (attack power oils)
- Pirate (utility glove enchants)

### Lower synergy with:

- Farmer (they benefit from glove perks but less so)
- Animal Tamer (pet scaling does not use enchants)

This makes Enchanting a support-craft powerhouse.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.7 SOCIAL ROLE

Enchanting reinforces Classic MMO culture:

- You must seek out an enchanter
- Enchanters become recognized names
- Player-run markets matter
- Ultra-Rare enchants become community status symbols
- Enchanters build reputations and regular clients

Enchanting is one of the few professions where:

- you can become server famous
- you offer live services
- people travel to YOU

This is pure Classic community identity.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.8 IDENTITY SUMMARY

Enchanting is:

- slow
- expensive
- permanent
- meaningful
- scarcity-based
- ritual-driven
- socially powerful
- a cornerstone of Classic philosophy

It is the single most important enhancement profession in Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 2 — MATERIAL SYSTEM, TOOLS, RODS & RITUAL STRUCTURE

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1 CORE MATERIAL ECONOMY — THE ENCHANTER’S CURRENCY

Enchanting runs on a strict four-tier Classic material hierarchy.

These materials define the entire power curve of the profession.

---

## 2.1.1 DUSTS — The Foundation

Dusts come from dismantling common-quality gear.

Properties:

- Abundant
- Used in 90% of enchants
- Required for basic → mid-tier recipes
- Currency of the low-level enchanting economy

Types (Classic progression):

- Pale Dust (1–75)
- Lampblack Dust (75–150)
- Median Ash (150–225)
- Silvergrain Dust (225–300)

Dusts provide the “base amount” of magic.

---

## 2.1.2 ESSENCES — Intermediate Power

Essences drop from uncommon → rare gear, and define mid-game enchants.

Properties:

- Rarer than dust
- Used for mid-tier stat bonuses
- Do not appear in early recipes
- Essential for leveling 120–225

Essence types:

- Lesser Spirit Essence
- Lesser Arcane Essence
- Greater Arcane Essence
- Greater Life Essence

Essences are the “shape” of an enchant — defining defensive, offensive, or utility identity.

---

## 2.1.3 SHARDS — High-Tier Binding Fuel

Shards come from rare / elite / dungeon gear, and are the backbone of Artisan-level enchants.

Properties:

- Always valuable
- Hard to stockpile
- Control the progression curve
- Required for top enchants and weapon rituals

Shard examples:

- Cracked Radiant Shard
- Purified Shard
- Brilliant Bound Shard
- Elder Resonant Shard

Shards are the first major choke-point enchanters face.

---

## 2.1.4 ULTRA-RARE CRYSTALS — Legendary Rarity

Crystals are the peak enchanting material.

Sources:

- Ultra-Rare drops
- Rare-Elite caches
- Hidden-world treasure
- Spirit Realm fissures
- Seasonal “Astral Convergence” events

Properties:

- Globally limited
- Hard-capped to prevent inflation
- Give only 3–5% more power than standard enchants
- Provide unique visual FX

Example:

- Astral Prism Crystal
- Heartshard Crystal
- Elder-Glow Core

Crystals are prestige materials — not power creep.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.2 REQUIRED TOOLS — THE ARTISAN’S KIT

Enchanting requires a full set of tools, in true Classic style.

---

## 2.2.1 Runic Rods (Core Tier Gate)

Each enchantment tier requires a corresponding rod.

Copper Rod (1–75)

Unlocks basic dust recipes.

Iron Rod (75–150)

Allows shoulder/cloak/boot enchants.

Steel Rod (150–225)

Grants access to bracer, glove, and mid-tier weapon enchants.

Elder Alloy Rod (225–300)

Enables top-tier chest, major stats, elemental oils, and Ultra-Rare rituals.

Rod Notes:

- Each rod demands rare components
- Each upgrade is expensive
- Rod progression itself is a major gold sink

This mimics Classic WoW’s pacing perfectly.

---

## 2.2.2 Ritual Components

### Arcane Ink

Made by scribes or found in ancient ruins.

Ink seals the enchant into parchment or binding plates.

### Parchment

Required to transfer enchants or prepare rituals.

### Incense & Catalysts

Late-tier rituals require:

- Blessing incense
- Spirit candles
- Binding salts
- Ancient coal ash

Small but critical sinks.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.3 CRAFTING STATIONS

Enchanting is NOT done anywhere.

Classic-era rules apply:

### 2.3.1 Town Sanctums (Apprentice → Journeyman)

- Wooden ritual tables
- Low-power foci
- Minimal risk

### 2.3.2 Regional Enclave Halls (Expert)

- Marble floors etched with runes
- Stronger focus chambers
- Dedicated item-binding circles

### 2.3.3 Master Sanctums (Artisan)

- Located in major capitals
- Require faction standing
- Allow shard and Ultra-Rare rituals
- True endgame environment

### 2.3.4 Spirit-Realm Foci (Optional 300+ Future Tier)

Used only for:

- Ultra-Rare Crystals
- Cosmetic tints
- Spirit attunement rituals

Rare nodes in the Spirit Realm grant unique ritual bonuses.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.4 RITUAL STRUCTURE — THE ANATOMY OF AN ENCHANTMENT

Enchanting is not “press button → enchant.”

It follows a four-step ritual cycle.

---

## 2.4.1 Step 1 — Preparation

- Lay out dusts, essences, or shards
- Place the item inside a circle
- Use Ink + Parchment to bind runes

Players must stand still — no movement during channel.

---

## 2.4.2 Step 2 — Attunement

Certain recipes require:

- Time of day
- Weather (rare bonuses)
- Specific sanctum type
- Spirit candles/light sources
- A ritual chant motion animation

This is entirely thematic — no gameplay RNG.

---

## 2.4.3 Step 3 — Binding

The enchant is sealed:

- Dust forms the foundation
- Essence defines the effect
- Shards stabilize the ritual
- Crystals (Ultra-Rare) add final brilliance

During this stage, the visual animations show:

- Dust spirals
- Essence wisps
- Shard resonance flashes

---

## 2.4.4 Step 4 — Imprint

The finished enchant flares:

- A faint runic shimmer
- A flash of color (based on material type)
- A quiet resonance sound

The item is now permanently altered.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 3 — SKILL PROGRESSION, LEVELING CURVE & TRAINING PATH (1–300)

────────────────────────────────────────

Enchanting progression in Emberwild follows a Classic-era progression arc—slow, expensive, and meaningfully gated. No shortcuts. No mass rushing. Every milestone matters.

This section fully defines the 1–300 leveling curve, the exact identity of each skill tier, and the intended player experience as they advance.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 3.1 OVERVIEW OF CLASSIC TIER STRUCTURE

Enchanting uses the 4-tier Classic system:

- Apprentice Enchanter (1–75)
- Journeyman Enchanter (75–150)
- Expert Enchanter (150–225)
- Artisan Enchanter (225–300)

Each tier increases:

- material complexity
- rod requirements
- station quality
- recipe diversity
- risk vs. cost

Each tier also reflects a different “era” of the game.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 3.2 APPRENTICE ENCHANTER (1–75) — The Dust Era

This is where the Enchanter learns the fundamentals.

### 3.2.1 Tier Fantasy

The Apprentice phase represents:

- tinkering
- experimenting
- learning basic binding

- Lampblack Dust
- Lesser Spirit Essence (rare)

### 3.2.3 Rod Requirement

### 3.4.5 Player Experience

Players now actively search for enchanters:

- bracer stat enchants matter
- cloak resist enchants matter
- dungeon bosses start dropping shard-tier gear

This is the demand spike.

### 3.4.6 Expected Enchants (Examples)

- Major Stamina (chest)
- Major Primary Stat (bracers)
- Mid-tier weapon damage
- First elemental weapon oils
- Dungeon-resistance enchants

### 3.4.7 Difficulty Profile

────────────────────────────────────────

# 3.7 LEVELLING PHILOSOPHY

Enchanting follows three design rules:

### Rule 1 — Slow Progression

You should:

- run out of mats
- have to disenchant constantly
- travel for trainers
- spend significant gold

### Rule 2 — Meaningful Milestones

At levels:

- 75
- 150
- 225
- 300

you unlock new power categories.

### Rule 3 — Social Crafting First

Enchanting makes the player known.

Nearly every stage encourages:

- trade
- cooperation
- interaction
- server identity

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 4 — FULL ENCHANTMENT CATALOG (WEAPON • ARMOR • UTILITY • CONSUMABLE • ULTRA-RARE)

────────────────────────────────────────

This section is structured exactly like a Classic-era reference manual:

- every enchant category
- every slot
- full Classic-tier power ranges
- explicit material tiers
- no modern nonsense
- all effects grounded and balanced for Emberwild’s slow progression, low inflation, and realism-first combat pacing.

This is the authoritative enchant list for the profession.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 4.0 CATALOG OVERVIEW

Enchants are grouped into 5 categories:

1. Weapon Enchants – Power, Accuracy, Crit, Technique, Oils
2. Armor Enchants – Slot-specific stat & utility boosts
3. Utility Enchants – Gathering, movement, environment
4. Consumable Enchants – Temporary weapon oils / armor dusts
5. Ultra-Rare Enchants – Cosmetic-tinted, prestige versions of standard enchants

Each enchant obeys:

- Classic stat caps
- Classic slot logic
- Material hierarchy
- Rod requirements

Everything here scales based on the Classic 1–300 profession tiers.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 5 — DISENCHANTING SYSTEM (LOGIC • MATERIAL TABLES • ODDS • CLASSIC RULESET)

────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines the full breakdown system for turning gear into enchanting materials.

It follows pure Classic WoW logic but is tuned for Emberwild’s item scarcity, dungeon pacing, and ultra-rare ecosystem.

No RNG bloat.

No modern tier inflation.

Everything is clean, predictable, and economically meaningful.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.0 OVERVIEW — WHAT DISENCHANTING IS

Disenchanting is the Enchanter’s ability to break gear into components:

- Dusts — from common gear
- Essences — from uncommon & rare
- Shards — from rare & elite tier
- Crystals — from Ultra-Rare sources only (never from Ultra-Rare gear)

Disenchanting is:

- a skill check
- an economy loop
- a progression gate
- a durability sink
- a major gold sink (repairing gear before breaking it if needed)

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.1 WHAT CAN BE DISENCHANTED

The following item types may be broken down:

### 5.1.1 Allowed Gear

- Common gear
- Uncommon gear
- Rare gear
- Rare Elite gear
- Dungeon Boss drops (non-Ultra-Rare tier)

### 5.1.2 Forbidden Gear

Cannot be disenchanted:

- Ultra-Rare gear
- Class artifacts
- Quest reward legendaries
- Tiered relics
- Heritage unique items

You cannot destroy the rarest items in the world.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.2 MATERIAL RETURNS (CLASSIC-ERA TABLES)

Based on your item design, each rarity tier returns specific materials with Classic-like probabilities.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 5.2.1 COMMON (WHITE) ITEMS

Yield: Dust Only

| Item Level | Dust Yield | Alpha Dust Type | Chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–20 | 1–2 | Pale Dust | 100% |
| 21–40 | 2–3 | Lampblack Dust | 100% |
| 41–60 | 3–4 | Median Ash | 100% |

No essences. No shards.

Common gear = dust economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 5.2.2 UNCOMMON (GREEN) ITEMS

Yield: Dust + Chance of Lesser Essence

| Item Level | Dust | Lesser Essence Chance | Essence Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–20 | 2–3 | 25% | Lesser Spirit Essence |
| 21–40 | 3–4 | 30% | Lesser Arcane Essence |
| 41–60 | 4–5 | 35% | Lesser Life Essence |

Green gear is the entry point into the mid-economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 5.2.3 RARE (BLUE) ITEMS

Yield: Dust + Essence + Chance of Shard

| Item Level | Dust | Greater Essence | Shard Chance | Shard Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–20 | 3–5 | Greater Spirit | 15% | Cracked Shard |
| 21–40 | 4–6 | Greater Arcane | 25% | Cracked Shard |
| 41–60 | 5–7 | Greater Life | 35% | Purified Shard |

Rare items form the backbone of Expert progression.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 5.2.4 RARE ELITE / MINIBOSS ITEMS

Yield: High Dust + Guaranteed Shard

| Item Level | Dust | Essence | Guaranteed Shard | Bonus Chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15–60 | 5–7 | Greater Life | Purified Shard | 5% chance Elder Resonant Shard |

This is the “dungeon pro” material tier.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 5.2.5 BOSS ITEMS (DUNGEON BOSSES)

Yield: Shards Only (High)

| Boss Tier | Guaranteed Shard | Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Dungeon Boss | Purified Shard | 5% chance Elder Resonant |
| High-End Dungeon Boss | Elder Resonant | 10% chance extra Elder |

This is where master enchanters get their real power.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.3 ULTRA-RARE CRYSTALS (SPECIAL LOOT LOGIC)

Ultra-Rare Crystals cannot ever be obtained by disenchanting gear.

Instead, they come from:

- Ultra-Rare world drops
- Fishing Ultra-Rares
- Rare Elite caches
- Boss 1-in-X drop tables
- Secret node spawns

### 5.3.1 Why They Cannot Come From Disenchanting

Because:

- your world uses a global Ultra-Rare tracking system
- every crystal is meant to matter
- destroying gear → unlimited crystals would break scarcity
- crystals are prestige, not progression

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.4 DISENCHANTING SKILL REQUIREMENTS

Gear requires a certain enchanting skill to break.

| Gear Level | Required Enchanting Skill |
| --- | --- |
| 1–15 | 1 |
| 16–25 | 25 |
| 26–35 | 75 |
| 36–45 | 150 |
| 46–60 | 225 |

If your enchanting skill is too low:

- disenchant fails
- item is destroyed
- you get nothing
- Classic punishment

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.5 DISENCHANTING LOCATION RULES

Most gear can be disenchanted anywhere.

Exception tiers require a focus:

### Journeyman+

- requires Enchanter’s Focus (portable)
- sold in hubs

### Expert

- requires a proper Sanctum or regional enclave
- must stand inside an arcane circle

### Artisan

- requires Master Sanctum
- may require special ritual incense

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.6 SPECIAL DISENCHANTING EVENTS

Certain items produce special results:

### 5.6.1 Cursed Gear

Yields:

- double dust
- small chance of hostile spirit manifestation

### 5.6.2 Spirit-Realm Gear

Yields:

- Spirit-Echo Dust
- Greater Arcane Essence

### 5.6.3 Dungeon Relics

Yields:

- Elder Resonant Shards
- guaranteed +1 bonus dust

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.7 WHY DISENCHANTING MATTERS TO THE ECONOMY

Because disenchanting is the bridge between:

- item drops
- crafting
- the endgame economy

It ensures:

- constant item turnover
- no item inflation
- dust never loses value
- shards remain expensive
- crystals never enter mass circulation

Disenchanting is the economic backbone of the Classic experience.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 6 — ECONOMIC ROLE, GOLD SINKS, MARKET LOOPS & SERVER-LIFETIME VALUE

────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines how Enchanting fits into the entire Emberwild economy, from early leveling to long-term server progression.

It mirrors Classic WoW’s economy structure but adapted to your slower pacing, item scarcity, Ultra-Rare ecosystem, and grounded gameplay.

Enchanting is designed to be one of the three central professions that permanently shape the world economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 THE ECONOMIC MISSION OF ENCHANTING

Enchanting acts as:

1. A major gold sink
2. A gear recycling loop
3. A profession that increases server power slowly
4. A stabilizer for item scarcity
5. A long-term market driver

Enchanting is intentionally:

- expensive
- slow
- socially dependent
- always in demand

This ensures the economy never inflates and low-level mats remain valuable forever.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 GOLD SINK STRUCTURE

Enchanting drains gold through:

### 6.1.1 Rod Upgrades

Each tier rod is expensive:

- Copper → Iron → Steel → Elder Alloy
- Crafted with bars, flux, binders, and niche mats
- High demand, high price

### 6.1.2 Parchments & Inks

Used constantly, creating:

- endless low-level gold sinks
- markets for scribes
- inter-profession dependency

### 6.1.3 Disenchanting Repairs

Gear must often be repaired before disenchanting.

(If broken → cannot DE.)

Huge late-game gold sink.

### 6.1.4 High-Tier Shards & Essences

Rare essences inflate in price over time.

Players must keep buying them.

### 6.1.5 Ultra-Rare Crystals

Massive, one-off gold dumps.

These crystals circulate for years and define prestige markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 THE MATERIAL-CIRCUIT ECONOMY

Enchanting creates a self-contained stable loop.

### Drops → Materials → Enchants → Progression → Harder Hunts → More Drops

Every player contributes whether they realize it or not.

The more people enchant:

- the more gear is destroyed
- the more mats stay valuable
- the more the economy stabilizes

This mirrors Classic WoW’s “infinite demand, finite supply” economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 MATERIAL DEMAND CURVE

Material value shifts over time:

### Dusts

- Surprisingly stable
- Required for every enchant
- Even high-level enchants need lower-tier dusts
- Never crash in price

### Essences

- Midgame bottleneck
- Required for core enchants
- Prices spike on every server

### Shards

- Elite/dungeon bottleneck
- Mobs drop very few
- Core ingredient of endgame gear
- Perpetual market scarcity

### Ultra-Rare Crystals

- Stable rarity
- Rarest item in the economy
- Prestige pricing
- Never lose value

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.4 SERVER-LIFETIME VALUE

Enchanting is designed to remain valuable forever, not just at launch.

### 6.4.1 Why Enchanting Never Dies

- new alts always need enchants
- economy constantly consumes mats
- enchant scrolls are destroyed on use
- new Ultra-Rares are always needed
- patches add more recipes, not more mats
- old enchants still sell

It is the only profession with perpetual demand from level 1 to 60.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.5 PLAYER-TO-PLAYER MARKET LOOPS

Enchanting strengthens:

### 6.5.1 Vendor Loop

Players buy materials from vendors → Enchanters earn → Vendors sink gold.

### 6.5.2 Dungeon Loop

Dungeons drop rare items → players disenchant → shards fuel endgame enchants.

### 6.5.3 Social Loop

Enchanting is the profession that:

- makes players gather
- encourages tipping
- forms reputation
- creates “Enchanter celebrities” like in Classic WoW

### 6.5.4 High-Economy Loop

Ultra-Rare enchants circulate for years, forming:

- black markets
- trade networks
- prestige collectors
- server-level auctions

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.6 REPUTATION & FACTION ECONOMICS

Faction vendors provide:

- specialty enchants
- rare materials
- unique inks
- shoulder runes (Classic logic)

This forces enchanters to:

- grind rep
- travel
- engage in world content
- interact with faction markets

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.7 HOW ENCHANTING INTERACTS WITH OTHER PROFESSIONS

Enchanting is deeply interconnected with:

### Herbalism (Ink pigments)

### Mining (Rods & alloys)

### Woodworking (Focus tools & ritual frames)

### Scribing (High-tier runic parchment)

### Fishing (Ultra-Rare crystal moment)

### Leatherworking (Glove profession enchants)

### Tailoring (Cloth dust infusion synergy)

Every profession feeds Enchanting at some scale.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT

Enchanting:

- stabilizes low-level markets
- drives mid-tier essence inflation
- creates shard scarcity
- anchors endgame Ultra-Rare economy
- forms a profession “meta”
- reinforces your world’s slow, grounded progression

Enchanting is the economic heart of Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 7 — RECIPE SOURCES, FACTION REQUISITES & DISCOVERY LOOPS

────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines exactly where Enchanting recipes come from in Emberwild—mirroring Classic WoW’s slow, meaningful, exploration-driven recipe hunting, but adapted fully to your world’s faction system, rare creatures, dungeons, and Ultra-Rare ecosystem.

No RNG bloat.

No vendor floods.

No modern convenience.

Everything here is discoverable, memorable, and tied deeply into your open world.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.0 DESIGN GOAL OF RECIPE DISTRIBUTION

Enchanting recipes must create:

1. Travel (players move)
2. Social value (enchanters become known)
3. Economic scarcity (recipes matter)
4. Role specialization (you don’t learn everything easily)
5. Long-term player identity

Each recipe has a purpose in the world.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.1 VENDOR RECIPES (CLASSIC STYLE)

Vendors offer basic and mid-tier recipes.

They do NOT offer endgame power.

### 7.1.1 Apprentice Vendor Recipes (1–75)

Locations:

- starter towns
- small enclaves

Recipes:

- Minor Armor Weave
- Minor Stamina (Bracers)
- Minor Agility (Gloves)
- Light Weapon Oil

Purpose:

Provide the baseline economy.

### 7.1.2 Journeyman Vendor Recipes (75–150)

Locations:

- regional towns
- faction-controlled outposts

Recipes:

- Cloak Armor Weave
- Gloves: Minor Haste
- Boots: Minor Movement
- Balanced Weapon Oil
- Dust of Focus

Purpose:

Create a travel loop across regions.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.2 WORLD DROP RECIPES

Classic-style random world drops, tuned to Emberwild’s ecosystem.

### 7.2.1 Common Drop Areas

- Wild beasts
- Bandits
- Corrupted constructs

Recipes (examples):

- Bracers: Greater Stat
- Boots: Greater Movement
- Weapon: Mysticism

These circulate constantly through the market.

### 7.2.2 Rare Creature Drop Recipes

Every region has 2–3 creatures with unique tables.

Examples:

- Storm Elk → “Tempest Inscription”
- Spine Serpent → “Iceshard Edge”
- Sand Wraith → “Surestrike Oil”

Purpose:

Tie the rare-hunting system to professions.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.3 DUNGEON RECIPES

Dungeon drops mirror Classic WoW:

- Rare
- Highly valuable
- Controlled drop rates
- Encourage repeat runs

### Dungeon Tier 1 (Low-Level)

Recipes:

- Weapon: Striking
- Chest: All Stats
- Gloves: Crafting Specializations

### Dungeon Tier 2 (Mid-Level)

Recipes:

- Greater Mysticism
- Greater Precision
- Major Stamina (Chest)

### Dungeon Tier 3 (High-Level)

Recipes:

- Major Stat Bracers
- Greater Ward Sigil (Shoulders)
- Greater Movement (Boots)

Dungeon recipes fuel midgame economy and guild marketplaces.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.4 FACTION-LOCKED RECIPES

Blend of Classic reputation and Emberwild’s faction system.

### 7.4.1 Regional Factions

Each region has a Master Enchanter NPC with 1–2 locked recipes.

Examples:

- Forester Lodge → “Sanctified Pages”
- Swamper Coven → “Resilient Mind” (Head resist enchant)
- Highlander Bastion → “Bracer: Fortifying Seal”

Reputation Required:

- Friendly → 1 recipe
- Honored → 1 recipe
- Revered → 1 rare recipe

These serve as status markers for enchanters.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.5 CRAFTING FACTIONS

Specialist factions offer niche recipes that may be the strongest in their category.

Examples:

- Astral Scribes → High-Tier Arcane Weapon Oils
- Ironforge Allies → Elder Alloy Rod techniques
- Lantern Order → Light-based resistance enchants

These are not required but give meaningful identity.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.6 SECRET / DISCOVERY RECIPES

Classic WoW had only a handful—Emberwild expands this into a system.

These recipes require:

- puzzles
- map fragments
- ritual sites
- Spirit-Realm toggling
- rare world events

Examples:

- “Shroud of Warding” hidden in a ruined temple
- “Greater Insight” requiring Spirit-Realm viewing
- “Ward of the Stoneblood” only learned by performing a ritual at faultline pillars

Discovery loops reward explorers.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.7 ULTRA-RARE RECIPE SOURCES

Ultra-Rare enchants require deliberate scarcity.

### 7.7.1 Ultra-Rare Hunts (1-in-X chance)

Only Ultra-tier creatures drop these fragments:

- Ancestral Edge
- Echo of Precision
- Elder’s Resolve

### 7.7.2 Boss Ultra-Rare Tables

Bosses have dedicated ultra-rare drop entries:

- 0.05% → crystal
- 0.10% → recipe fragment
- 0.15% → rare shard

### 7.7.3 Fishing Ultra-Rare

One of the coolest systems in Emberwild:

- extremely small chance to “hook a crystal node”
- leads to a ritual site
- guaranteed Ultra-Rare recipe if completed

### 7.7.4 Global Tracking

Ultra-Rare recipes are globally limited:

- e.g., only 8 of a given recipe ever exist
- creates server legends
- enchanters become celebrities

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.8 SEASONAL & EVENT RECIPES

Limited-time special recipes, Classic style.

### Examples:

- Winter’s Veil → Frost Resistance Cloak
- Harvest Season → “Dust of Plenty”
- Moonrise Festival → “Moon-Seer Oil”

These recur yearly.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.9 ECONOMIC IMPACT OF RECIPE DISTRIBUTION

This structure ensures:

- early accessibility
- midgame travel
- endgame prestige
- permanent value
- no recipe inflation
- no oversupply
- a real Classic economy

Enchanting recipes become part of your game’s culture, not just items.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 8 — LIMITATIONS, SAFETY RULES & POWER-CAP SYSTEMS

────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines the hard rules that keep Enchanting grounded, Classic-accurate, and permanently balanced across the entire lifetime of Emberwild.

These rules prevent:

- power creep
- enchant stacking exploits
- profession meta breakage
- class identity violations
- inflation of stats beyond Classic values

This is the “laws of physics” for Enchanting.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.0 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Every limitation in this chapter is based on three design laws:

### Law 1 — Classic Power Boundaries

No enchant may exceed Classic-tier power ceilings.

### Law 2 — Identity Before Optimization

Enchants cannot violate Class identity, weapon identity, armor identity.

### Law 3 — Scarcity Must Remain Scarce

Materials, crystals, high-tier rods, and recipes must never inflate.

These rules make the entire profession viable for years.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.1 ENCHANT STACKING RULES

### 8.1.1 One Permanent Enchant per Item Slot

No exceptions.

You cannot:

- apply two enchants
- stack a permanent + a semi-permanent
- apply different enchants to the same item over time

Applying a new enchant overwrites the old.

### 8.1.2 Permanent Enchant + Consumable = OK

You may apply temporary oils/dusts on top of a permanent enchant.

Classic logic.

### 8.1.3 Ultra-Rare + Permanent = Overwrite

Ultra-Rare enchants replace normal enchants.

They do not stack.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.2 STAT LIMITATIONS & POWER CAPS

To avoid power creep:

### 8.2.1 Weapon Caps

Weapon enchants cannot exceed:

- +8 Weapon Damage
- +12 Spell/Technique Power
- +2% Crit
- +2% Hit

Ultra-Rare versions may go 3–5% above these caps, nothing more.

### 8.2.2 Armor Caps

By slot:

- Chest: +25 Stamina / +2 All Stats
- Bracers: +7 Primary Stat
- Boots: +5% Movement
- Gloves: +1% Haste / +Profession Skill
- Legs: +45 Armor
- Cloak: +20 Armor / +6 Resist
- Shoulders: +8 Resist
- Head: +6 Primary Stat

These numbers match Classic power scaling.

### 8.2.3 Resist Caps

Maximum resistances obtainable from enchants:

- 10 per slot, but shoulders are limited to 8.

### 8.2.4 No % Damage Bonuses

No enchant can add:

- % increased damage
- % increased spell damage
- % crit damage
- % armor penetration

This preserves class roles and game pacing.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.3 CLASS IDENTITY PROTECTION RULES

Enchanting cannot:

- Replace class weaknesses
- Turn classes into something they are not
- Give flat bonuses that invalidate skill trees

### Examples:

- No movement enchants on chest/legs that undermine Seaborn mobility fantasy
- No dodge/block enchants that break Highlander tank logic
- No stealth/invisibility enchants that break Spirit Binder/Witch identity
- No pet-enhancing enchants that replace Animal Tamer skill trees

Everything must respect your class compendium.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.4 EQUIPMENT TYPE RESTRICTIONS

To maintain realism and Classic pacing:

### 8.4.1 No Enchants on:

- Rings
- Necklaces
- Trinkets
- Relic relics (heritage class artifacts)
- Bags
- Ammo
- Tools

These item types stay unenchanted.

### 8.4.2 Allowed Non-Armor Items

- Tomes
- Relics
- Shields
- Totems

These follow the off-hand enchant category.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.5 ROD PROGRESSION LIMIT RULES

Rods act as hard gates.

### 8.5.1 Copper Rod

- Apprentice enchants only
- Cannot apply Journeyman or higher effects

### 8.5.2 Iron Rod

- Required for first real power enchants
- Cannot apply Expert/Artisan effects

### 8.5.3 Steel Rod

- Required for Expert enchants
- Unlocks shard-tier crafting

### 8.5.4 Elder Alloy Rod

- Required for all 225+ enchants
- Required for Ultra-Rare enchants
- Difficult endgame investment

These rods create real prestige in high-end Enchanters.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.6 ITEM LEVEL RESTRICTIONS

Classic design:

Higher-tier enchants require higher-level gear.

### Requirements by Tier:

- Apprentice enchants → no restriction
- Journeyman enchants → item level 15+
- Expert enchants → item level 35+
- Artisan enchants → item level 50+
- Ultra-Rare enchants → item level 55+ only

You cannot apply powerful enchantments on low-level twinks.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.7 MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS

Materials enforce pacing:

### Dusts

Unlimited use, baseline resource.

### Essences

Bind enchants to mid-tier progression.

### Shards

Prevent easy power spikes.

### Crystals

Absolute scarcity → absolute prestige.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.8 TRAINING & SKILL GATING

Enchanting skill progression is intentionally punishing:

- Failing disenchanting below skill breaks the item
- You cannot “rush” to 300 without enormous cost
- Trainers are region-locked
- Artisan training requires questlines
- Ultra-Rare recipes cannot be trained

This preserves the Classic experience.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.9 SAFETY RULES FOR ECONOMY & POWER

To ensure the world stays balanced:

### 8.9.1 No New Enchants Post-Launch That Exceed Power Caps

All future enchants must obey Classic limits.

### 8.9.2 No Profession-Only Buffs Outside Utility

Enchanting cannot become a combat advantage profession.

### 8.9.3 Ultra-Rare Scarcity Must Never Increase

Global tracking remains immutable.

### 8.9.4 Enchants Must Be Destroyed On Item Replace

Maintains continuous resource consumption.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.10 WHY THESE LIMITS MATTER

They ensure:

- perfect long-term class balance
- stable economy
- no power creep
- fair PvP
- meaningful item progression
- inevitable role specialization

Enchanting becomes a prestige craft, not a stat inflation machine.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 9 — FINAL DESIGN CHECKLIST & END-OF-CHAPTER SUMMARY

────────────────────────────────────────

This final section exists to lock in the entire Enchanting profession under the Classic-Era Emberwild ruleset.

It ensures the system is:

- internally consistent
- economically stable
- balanced across all tiers
- permanently future-proof
- aligned with the identity of your world

Everything below is a developer-facing validation list — the same style we used for Class Bible endcaps (Hunter, Highlander, Frost Guard, Priest, etc.).

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.0 GLOBAL CHECKLIST — THE 28 RULES OF ENCHANTING

### 9.0.1 Power Boundaries

✔ No enchant exceeds Classic ceilings

✔ Ultra-Rare enchants stay within +3–5%

✔ No % damage, no penetration, no crit-damage modifiers

✔ Movement enchants capped at +5%

✔ Resistances capped at ±10

### 9.0.2 Slot Integrity

✔ Only one permanent enchant per item

✔ Consumables do not stack with other consumables

✔ No enchants for rings, necks, trinkets, bags, tools

✔ Off-hand items follow dedicated logic

### 9.0.3 Class Identity Protection

✔ Cannot override class weaknesses

✔ Cannot create stealth/mobility/tank tools outside fitting classes

✔ Cannot enhance pets

✔ Cannot add dodge/block on non-tank classes

✔ Cannot add ranged/caster stats to melee-only classes

✔ All enchants must reinforce combat roles, not negate them

### 9.0.4 Material Hierarchy

✔ Dust → Essence → Shard → Crystal flows respected

✔ Crystals never obtainable through disenchanting

✔ All rod tiers enforced

✔ Shards remain rare dungeon bottlenecks

✔ Essences remain mid-tier market bottlenecks

### 9.0.5 Disenchanting Rules

✔ Lower skill risks item destruction

✔ Higher rarity = higher quality returns

✔ Ultra-Rare gear protected

✔ Regional sanctums needed for high-tier DE

✔ Spirit-Realm items yield special essences

### 9.0.6 Recipe Acquisition

✔ Vendor recipes limited to low-mid tiers

✔ High-tier enchants through:

- dungeons
- factions
- world rares
- discovery puzzles
- Ultra-Rare hunts
    
    ✔ Recipes never flood the market
    
    ✔ Ultra-Rare recipes globally limited
    

### 9.0.7 Profession Progression

✔ 1–300 Classic progression

✔ Rod-gated enchant access

✔ Trainers locked behind faction/travel requirements

✔ Artisan tier requires quest arcs

✔ Skill leveling intentionally slow & expensive

### 9.0.8 Economic Integrity

✔ Dust maintains infinite demand

✔ Essences maintain midgame bottleneck

✔ Shards maintain endgame scarcity

✔ Ultra-Rares remain prestige only

✔ Enchanting acts as a constant gold sink

✔ Player-to-player trade loop preserved

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.1 ROLE IN THE GAME WORLD

Enchanting fulfills four permanent economic roles:

### 9.1.1 Gear Stimulation

Players always want enchants; enchants always feed dust/essence/shard demand → keeps the item economy alive.

### 9.1.2 Social Profession

Just like Classic WoW:

- people gather
- people tip
- reputation forms
- certain enchanters become server-famous

### 9.1.3 Progression Stabilizer

Each enchant is a small buff, not a power spike.

This keeps:

- classes balanced
- health pools stable
- damage curves predictable
- raid tuning grounded

### 9.1.4 Prestige Craft

Ultra-Rare enchants give enchanters a social “identity” — a real Rare badge.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.2 TEST SUITE — INTERNAL DEV VALIDATION

This is your development-side validation list.

When adding or modifying enchants in future patches, verify:

- Does it break Class identity?
- Does it exceed Classic stat caps?
- Does it introduce new resource tiers?
- Does it undermine profession scarcity?
- Does it power creep early/mid/late game?
- Does it invalidate existing enchants?
- Does it violate the one-per-slot rule?

If yes to any → reject the change.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.3 PATCH & FUTURE-PROOFING RULES

To preserve integrity across expansions without power creep:

1. New enchants must never exceed existing power caps.
2. New Ultra-Rares may be added, but never increase global totals.
3. New recipes must integrate into the existing dust/essence/shard structure.
4. No “catch-up mechanics” for enchanting skill; Classic pacing only.
5. Enchanting remains a gold sink forever; never add cost-reducing mechanics.
6. No crafting automation; rituals remain manual and costly.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.4 END-OF-CHAPTER SUMMARY

Enchanting in Emberwild is:

### A Classic-Era, Slow-Burn, High-Prestige Profession

- grounded
- difficult
- rewarding
- slow
- expensive
- socially influential

It creates:

- economic circulation
- meaningful item destruction
- stable market values
- profession identity
- community recognition

And NEVER breaks class design or item progression.

This is the FINAL, fully-locked Classic Enchanting System 1.0.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 10 — PROFESSION QUESTLINE

### “THE BINDING PATH: RITES OF DUST, ESSENCE & CRYSTAL”

────────────────────────────────────────

A full 1–300 profession saga, mirroring Classic WoW’s Artisan quests, but deeply grounded in Emberwild ritualism and low-fantasy enchantment.

Total Stages: 7

Difficulty: High

Core Themes:

- patience
- ritual discipline
- essence safety
- shard resonance
- world travel
- Spirit-Realm attunement

────────────────────────────────────────

# 10.0 QUESTLINE OVERVIEW

This chain:

- unlocks Artisan Enchanting (225–300)
- trains the player in disenchanting discipline
- introduces dust → essence → shard → crystal philosophy
- binds the player to the classic, ritualistic identity of enchantment
- requires travel to various sanctums and foci
- teaches careful material use

No modern shortcuts.

This is slow, meaningful Classic progression.

────────────────────────────────────────
