# CHAPTER 23 — COOKING

---

## SECTION 1 — PROFESSION OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

Classic-Era Profession • Survival • Buff Food • Slow • Material-Driven

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.1 PROFESSION FANTASY — THE HARTHEARTH ART

Cooking in Emberwild is not magic.

It is survival. Craft. Patience. Resourcefulness.

It follows the exact Classic-era DNA:

- slow
- grounded
- realistic
- zero fantasy nonsense
- all buffs tiny, meaningful, Classic-balanced
- everything dependent on ingredients, fire, and skill

Cooking is the craft of the wandering hunter, the village chef, the expedition guide — anyone who knows how to turn raw world resources into nourishment and long-haul preparation.

Identity pillars:

- Survival over spectacle
- Preparation over power
- Realistic food over magical effects
- Ingredient scarcity over convenience
- Exploration over automation
- Classic stat caps over modern inflation

Visually and thematically, Cooking is:

- campfires
- iron skillets
- wooden ladles
- pots hung over emberbeds
- rustic meals
- earthy colors
- believable recipes
- slow simmering

There is no world where cooking high-fantasy superfood exists.

Only Emberwild’s grounded Classic meals.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.2 ROLE WITHIN THE WORLD

Cooking serves three world functions:

### A. Survival Loop

Cooking ensures players can sustain themselves during:

- long hunts
- dungeon expeditions
- travel between regions
- harsh biomes

Meals restore:

- health
- stamina/vitality
- focus/mana (slow Classic regen)

### B. Classic Buff Food Identity

Some meals grant small, Classic-style buffs:

- +Stamina
- +Strength
- +Agility
- +Spirit / Focus regen
- +small resistances
- +minor armor (very small)

These buffs are:

- long duration (30–60 min)
- non-stacking
- cheaper than alchemy
- weaker than alchemy
- foundational to Classic preparation

### C. Economic Glue

Cooking ties multiple professions together:

- Hunting (meat, organs, fats)
- Fishing (fish, rare deepwater species)
- Herbalism/Foraging (roots, mushrooms, greens)
- Trade (spices, salts, oils, grain)

Every player uses food.

Demand is permanent.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.3 THEMATIC PILLARS

Cooking rests on six design pillars:

- Grounded Flavor — all dishes believable
- Small Buffs — Classic values, never meta-breaking
- Material Intensity — ingredients matter more than skill
- Slow Pacing — campfire downtime, not speed crafting
- Exploration-Driven — ingredients spread across biomes
- One-Buff Rule — Classic design integrity

This is the most universal support profession in Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.4 PLAYSTYLE OF THE PROFESSION

Cooking’s gameplay loop:

1–75: Low-Skill Meals

- basic meats
- simple fish
- beginner stews
- low regen values

75–150: Early Buff Foods

- small STR/AGI/STA meals
- ingredient variety begins
- high demand from leveling players

150–225: Dungeon Prep Meals

- resistance foods
- hybrid foods
- high-tier fish dishes
- group-wide demand

225–300: Artisan Cooking

- rare meats
- seasonal dishes
- deepwater fish use
- Ultra-Rare cooking books / ingredients

Late cooking is:

- expensive
- prestigious
- long-term relevant

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.5 VALUE CURVE ACROSS LEVELS (1–60)

Cooking value spikes naturally at:

Midgame (25–40)

- first real buff foods appear
- dungeon players seek consistent regen

Late Midgame (40–50)

- resistance foods become important
- STR/AGI/STA meals steady the grind

Endgame (50–60)

- hybrid meals
- Ultra-Rare artisan dishes
- market economy stabilizes

Cooking has the most consistent demand loop in the entire profession system.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.6 CLASS INTERACTIONS & SYNERGY

Strong synergy:

- Tanks — STA meals & armor meals
- DPS — STR/AGI buff foods
- Casters/Support — Spirit & regen foods
- Hunter / Sand Strider — regen + AGI foods
- Farmer — ingredient synergy
- Highlander / Frost Guard — resistance foods for boss fights

Moderate synergy:

- Witch — slow regen meals for out-of-combat
- Animal Tamer — pet food synergy (but non-buff)

Minimal synergy:

- Professions that rely mostly on gear over sustain.

Cooking touches all players — even if only through health regen downtime.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.7 SOCIAL ROLE

Cooking strengthens server identity:

- gathering around campfires
- group meal preparation before hunts
- traveling cooks at caravan stops
- famous chefs selling artisan meals
- event-based cooking competitions

Cooking is communal, nostalgic, and classic MMO culture.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.8 IDENTITY SUMMARY

Cooking in Emberwild is:

- slow
- grounded
- realistic
- universally relevant
- ingredient-intensive
- buff-light
- Classic-accurate

It is the foundation of the survival and buff economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 2 — TOOLS, FIRES, HEAT SOURCES & CRAFTING RULES

Classic-Era Systems • No Modern Convenience • Realistic Preparation

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.1 CORE TOOLS — THE COOK’S KIT

Cooking in Emberwild requires physical tools.

No tools = no cooking. Period.

### 2.1.1 Flint & Tinder

Used to ignite:

- campfires
- travel stoves
- hearth coals

Consumed slowly.

Starter towns sell replacements.

### 2.1.2 Cooking Pot

Required for:

- stews
- soups
- boiled meals
- hybrid meals

Heavy.

Cannot be used while moving.

### 2.1.3 Skillet / Pan

Required for:

- seared meats
- pan-cooked fish
- fried dishes

Medium weight.

Can be placed on any proper heat source.

### 2.1.4 Spice Kit

Contains:

- salts
- peppers
- herbs
- pickling agents

Slowly consumed.

Needed for 90% of buff foods.

### 2.1.5 Chef’s Utensils

High-tier toolset:

- ladle
- iron blade
- grinder
- fine stir sticks

Required for:

- Expert dishes
- Artisan dishes
- Ultra-Rare meals

Reduces:

- failure rate
- burnt meal chance

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.2 HEAT SOURCE REQUIREMENTS

A dish is only cookable when the player is within range of a valid heat source.

### Valid Heat Sources

- campfires
- town hearths
- inn stoves
- caravan grills
- Emberwild-crafted travel stoves (late-game)
- wilderness stone-lined fire pits

### Invalid Heat Sources

- torches
- magical flames
- spirit energy
- lanterns
- environmental fire props

Only real, physical heat counts.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.3 COOKING ENVIRONMENTS

Cooking environment influences:

- failure chance
- burn chance
- aroma-based stealth aggro (very light)
- weather interference

### 2.3.1 Campfires (Basic Tier)

Pros:

- easiest to create
- usable almost anywhere
- perfect for basic meals

Cons:

- moderate failure rate
- slow heat-up time
- cannot cook advanced dishes

### 2.3.2 Town Hearths (Journeyman Tier)

Pros:

- stable flame
- minimal failure rate
- supports buff foods

Cons:

- requires traveling back to town

### 2.3.3 Enclave Kitchens / Caravan Grills (Expert Tier)

Pros:

- perfect flame consistency
- artisan recipes enabled
- faster cooking

Cons:

- must find an enclave or caravan

### 2.3.4 Travel Stove (Artisan Tier)

Crafted using:

- Woodworking
- Engineering components

Pros:

- portable
- high heat
- supports nearly all recipes

Cons:

- expensive
- requires fuel
- slow to deploy

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.4 WEATHER, SEASON & LOCATION INTERACTION RULES

Cooking is not isolated from the environment.

The world affects your craft.

### 2.4.1 Weather Effects

- Rain — raises burn chance by +10%, increases failure chance
- Snow — lowers heat efficiency, slowing cook time
- Storms — cannot cook near high-wind cliffs
- Fog — neutral

### 2.4.2 Season Effects

- Winter — cooking takes 15% longer outdoors
- Summer — no effect
- Autumn — increased aroma aggro from beasts
- Spring — certain herb-based dishes require fresh sprigs (season-locked)

### 2.4.3 Location Effects

- swamp fires sputter → +5% failure
- tundra fires fade faster
- high-altitude fires burn hotter → -10% cook time

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.5 THE COOKING ACTION — RITUAL STRUCTURE

Cooking is not instant.

It follows a four-step process mirroring Enchanting’s ritual structure.

### 2.5.1 Step 1 — Preparation

- place pot/pan
- add ingredients
- spice kit check
- heat source verification

### 2.5.2 Step 2 — Simmer

The longest phase:

- pot sits on heat source
- smell drift effect
- player cannot move far
- chance of “well-prepared” quality bonus

### 2.5.3 Step 3 — Finish

- final stir or flip
- dish finalizes
- burn chance resolves
- buff applies to the created item

### 2.5.4 Step 4 — Cool

- dish becomes inventory-ready
- stackable up to 20
- Ultra-Rare dishes stack to 5 only

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.6 CRAFTING FAILURE & QUALITY SPECTRUM

### Failure Types

1. Burnt Meal — unusable, but yields Charcoal Dust
2. Undercooked Meal — half-effect, low duration
3. Ruin — nothing produced

### Quality Types

1. Basic Prepared — normal result
2. Well-Prepared — +10% duration
3. Expert-Prepared — +15% duration, +1 extra buff point
4. Master-Prepared (Artisan only) — +20% duration

Quality is influenced by:

- chef’s utensils
- cooking skill
- heat source
- weather
- ingredient quality

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.7 MULTI-INGREDIENT & ADVANCED DISH RULES

High-end meals require:

- 3–6 different ingredients
- 1–2 trade goods
- longer simmer phases
- specialty tools

Hybrid and Ultra-Rare meals cannot:

- be cooked at campfires
- be rushed
- be batch-crafted

They require:

- enclave kitchens, OR
- travel stoves

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.8 STORAGE & SPOILAGE RULES

To preserve realism and Classic pacing:

Meals NEVER spoil (QoL).

But ingredients DO:

- raw meats spoil in 6 real-world hours
- rare cuts spoil in 12 hours
- fish spoil in 3 hours
- vegetables spoil in 48 hours

Storable via:

- Salt-packing
- Pickling jars
- Drying racks
- Cold-cellar crates

These require Cooking or Farmer profession support.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 5 — RECIPE ACQUISITION, DROP SOURCES & DISCOVERY SYSTEM

Classic WoW–Inspired • Travel-Heavy • Exploration-Driven

────────────────────────────────────────

This section mirrors the Enchanting/Fishing/Engineering recipe distribution systems — slow, meaningful, non-inflated, and tied to the world.

Cooking recipes are found from:

- vendors
- quests
- rare drops
- seasonal events
- deepwater fishing caches
- faction reputation
- Ultra-Rare global tables

Nothing is mass-granted.

Nothing is instant.

Every recipe is a journey.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.0 DESIGN GOALS FOR RECIPE DISTRIBUTION

Each recipe must:

1. Encourage exploration
2. Force travel or biome interaction
3. Tie into ecosystem loops (Hunting, Fishing, Foraging)
4. Support regional identity
5. Introduce long-term profession mastery

No recipe can:

- flood the market
- be too common
- trivialize ingredient gathering

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 6 — ECONOMICS, MARKET LOOPS & SERVER-WIDE DEMAND CURVE

Slow Economy • High Consumption • Permanent Value • Classic Design

────────────────────────────────────────

Cooking is one of the core pillars of Emberwild’s economy, alongside Enchanting, Fishing, and Gathering professions.

It has constant demand, continuous material turnover, and Classic-era gold sinks built into its loop.

Below is the full economic structure — designed exactly like your Enchanting/Fishing economy systems.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 THE ECONOMIC MISSION OF COOKING

Cooking exists to:

1. Stabilize low-tier materials
2. Create continuous demand for meats, fish, herbs, and trade goods
3. Populate markets with consumables
4. Provide predictable but low gold-per-hour income
5. Anchor the Survival & Buff ecosystem

Because every player eats food, the profession never loses value.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 GOLD SINK STRUCTURE

Cooking drains gold through:

### 6.1.1 Spices & Salts (Constant Sink)

- used in 90% of recipes
- always consumed
- purchased regularly

Creates a continuous gold drain for every player.

### 6.1.2 Cooking Oils

- tallow, seed oil, marrow oil
- used for frying, hybrid meals
- moderately expensive
- sourced via trade or self-production

### 6.1.3 Ingredient Spoilage

Spoilage indirectly drains gold because players must:

- buy more ingredients
- prepare preservation agents
- avoid letting ingredients rot
- travel back to towns

### 6.1.4 Rare Ingredient Hunting

Rare meats = expensive travel:

- mounts
- boats
- fees
- caravan rides
- repairs

Economy tied to exploration.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 MATERIAL-CIRCUIT ECONOMY (THE FEAST LOOP)

Cooking sits in the center of a five-profession loop:

Hunting → Meats → Cooking → Buff Foods → Dungeon Progression → More Hunts

Fishing → Fish → Cooking → Regen Meals → Exploration → More Fishing

Farmer → Grains/Vegetables → Cooking → Hybrid Meals → Player Sustain → More Farming

Foraging → Herbs/Roots → Cooking → Buff Foods → Market → More Foraging

Trade Goods → Spices/Salt/Oils → Cooking → Buff Demand → Gold Sink

This loop makes Cooking one of the most self-sustaining economies in your game.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 DEMAND CURVE OVER THE SERVER LIFETIME

Cooking demand never drops below 80% baseline due to buff consumption.

### PHASE 1 — Launch Era (Levels 1–30)

Demand: Very High

- leveling players need regen foods
- STR/AGI/STA foods become meta early
- ingredient supply low

### PHASE 2 — Midgame Expansion (Levels 30–50)

Demand: Peak

- tank foods and DPS foods sell hourly
- hybrid meals begin circulating
- dungeons require consistent prep
- chefs become well-known in towns

### PHASE 3 — Endgame Stability (Levels 50–60)

Demand: Permanent High

- hybrid meals dominate
- resist foods required for rare hunts/bosses
- Ultra-Rare dishes become luxury/collector items
- cooking fuels dungeon & hunting loops

### PHASE 4 — Postgame / Second Wind Era

Demand: Stable High

- cooking becomes a prestige lifestyle
- collectors buy Ultra-Rare dishes
- hybrid meals consumed en masse
- travelers and alt characters constantly restock

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.4 MARKET TYPES & PLAYER LOOP

Cooking interfaces with three core markets:

### 6.4.1 Vendor Loop

Players buy:

- spices
- oils
- flour
- basic salts
- cheap ingredients

Vendors → Gold Sink.

Players → Market Stimulation.

### 6.4.2 Player-to-Player Loop

Cooks sell:

- buff foods
- hybrid meals
- dungeon prep foods
- artisan dishes

Buyers range from:

- tanks
- DPS
- casters
- hunters
- explorers

This is the main market loop.

### 6.4.3 Rare Ingredient Loop

Collective economy where players trade:

- rare meats
- deepwater fish
- seasonal herbs
- Stormbound species
- Ultra-Rare fish/meats

These items are always in demand.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.5 SPOILAGE → ECONOMIC IMPACT

Ingredient spoilage (not cooked meals) ensures:

- constant need for raw materials
- no infinite storage exploitation
- no hoarding
- fluctuating market prices
- farm/hunt/fish loops remain alive

This mirrors true Classic, where ingredients never felt infinite.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.6 PROFESSION INTERDEPENDENCY

Cooking depends on:

- Hunters → meat, fat
- Fishers → fish, rare species
- Farmers → grains, vegetables, dairy
- Foragers → mushrooms, herbs
- Traders → spices, salts, oils
- Woodworkers → cooking accessories
- Engineers → travel kitchens

This makes Cooking the most interconnected profession.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.7 LATE-GAME ECONOMIC ROLE

At level 60, Cooking becomes:

- a preparation meta
- raid/hunt requirement
- top-tier market occupation
- prestige specialism (Ultra-Rare feasts)
- essential for Hardcore players

Cooking remains relevant until the final patch of the game.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 GOLD-PER-HOUR PHILOSOPHY

Cooking revenue remains intentionally flat:

### Early Game:

1–3g/hr (stable)

### Mid Game:

5–10g/hr (demand spikes)

### Late Game:

10–15g/hr (buff foods + rare ingredients)

### Ultra-Rare Market:

∞ (player-driven — prestige only, not consistent income)

Cooking is never top-tier gold, but always reliable.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.9 WHY COOKING NEVER DIES

Because:

- every player eats food
- buffs cannot stack, so demand is constant
- raw ingredients keep spoiling
- travel friction makes local chefs valuable
- resist foods needed for biomes
- Ultra-Rares maintain prestige meta

Cooking = forever useful.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 7 — PROFESSION QUESTLINE: THE CHEF’S PATH

Classic-Era Progression • Exploration • Travel • No Modern Shortcuts

────────────────────────────────────────

This questline mirrors Fishing’s “Angler’s Path” and Enchanting/Engineering’s mastery quests — slow, atmospheric, multi-zone, skill-gated.

It covers Apprentice → Journeyman → Expert → Artisan, with unique recipes, travel, and Classic friction.

No fluff. Only clean, Notion-ready content.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.0 QUESTLINE PHILOSOPHY

Cooking’s questline is designed to:

- teach players the world’s ingredient ecosystems

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 8 — LIMITATIONS, SAFETY RULES & POWER-CAP SYSTEMS

Classic-Era • Grounded • Non-Magical • One-Buff Logic

────────────────────────────────────────

Cooking in Emberwild follows hard laws that cannot be broken.

These rules ensure:

- No power creep
- No modernized shortcuts
- No “food meta” overtaking class or gear identity
- No stacking exploits
- No magical or unrealistic meals
- Classic realism in all stat buffs

These laws are immutable and define the physics of all future cooking content.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 8.0 DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Cooking is governed by three global laws:

### LAW 1 — Realism Before Power

Food must always feel grounded.

No magical effects.

No supernatural stat jumps.

### LAW 2 — Classic Stat Philosophy

Buffs are:

- Small
- Slow
- Long-duration
- Single-source
- Never raid-breaking
- Never combat-defining

### LAW 3 — Ingredient Truth

Every buff must come from a logical ingredient mixture.

Example:

- +STA = hearty meats, fats
- +AGI = lean cuts, fish, root vegetables
- +SPI = herbal teas, broths
- Resistances = special regional spices

Nothing random.

Everything rooted in world ecology.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.1 BUFF LIMITATIONS (THE BUFF LAWS)

### 8.1.1 One Food Buff At A Time

Non-negotiable.

Eating a new buff food overwrites the old one.

### 8.1.2 Food Buffs Do NOT Stack With:

- Potions
- Oils
- Scrolls
- Enchants
- Consumables of the same category

Classic logic.

### 8.1.3 Absolute Power Caps

Food buffs cannot exceed:

- +10 Strength
- +10 Agility
- +20 Stamina
- +8 Spirit
- +8 Armor
- +5 all Resistances
    
    (Individual categories: Fire, Frost, Nature, Shadow, Arcane)
    

Ultra-Rare meals may be +3–5% stronger, nothing more.

### 8.1.4 No % Bonuses

Never allowed:

- % Damage
- % Crit
- % Attack speed
- % Spell power
- % Regen rates
- % Resistances
- % Dodge/block/parry

Food is linear, not multiplicative.

### 8.1.5 Long Durations Only

Buff food must last:

- Minimum: 20 minutes
- Standard: 30 minutes
- High-tier: 60 minutes

No short burst buffs.

No combat clicking advantages.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.2 COMBAT RULES

### 8.2.1 No Cooking During Combat

Zero exceptions.

Heat sources cannot be used in combat.

### 8.2.2 No Eating During Combat

Eating is a 3-second channel that cancels on hit.

This prevents spam-healing via food.

### 8.2.3 No Combat-Enhancing Meals

Food cannot grant abilities:

- No speed boosts
- No damage procs
- No regen ticks in combat
- No defensive shields
- No absorption
- No stealth
- No crit-damage buffs

Food = prep, not combat advantage.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.3 COOKING REQUIREMENTS & SAFETY RULES

### 8.3.1 Heat Source Rule

Cooking requires:

- Campfire
- Hearth
- Stove
- Caravan grill
- Spirit-flame (Artisan tier only)

No “cook anywhere.”

### 8.3.2 Material Requirement Rule

If the ingredient is missing, the recipe fails.

If the heat source is wrong, the recipe fails.

No auto-crafting.

No ingredient substitution.

### 8.3.3 Tool Requirement Rule

High-tier meals require:

- Cooking pot
- Skillet
- Spice kit
- Chef’s utensils

Missing tools = recipe failure.

### 8.3.4 Failure = Ingredient Loss

Classic pain:

Failed cooking destroys materials.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.4 SPOILAGE SYSTEM RULES

### 8.4.1 Raw Meat Spoilage

Raw meats:

- Spoil after 2 hours real-time
- Become “Spoiled Cuts”
- Are unusable except in alchemy/compost (future systems)

### 8.4.2 Fish Spoilage

Fish spoil significantly faster:

- 45 minutes real-time
- Must be cooked immediately or preserved

### 8.4.3 Preserved Foods

Salted, dried, smoked products:

- Last indefinitely
- Provide no buffs
- Serve travel/survival needs

### 8.4.4 Hot Meals Expire

Cooked buff foods:

- Expire after 24 hours real-time
- Lose buff and become “Cold Meals” (low regen only)

Spoilage prevents hoarding.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.5 LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT RULES

### 8.5.1 Zone-Specific Buff Logic

Some foods only function in specific environments:

- Ice-resist soups → cold zones
- Swamp stews → swamp toxin zones
- Fire-resistant meals → volcanic zones

### 8.5.2 Weather Interaction

Some recipes require:

- Rain
- Fog
- Clear sky
- Nighttime
- Storms

Classic friction for mastery.

### 8.5.3 Seasonal Rules

Certain meals require:

- Spring veggies
- Autumn grains
- Winter fish cracks
- Summer herbs

Seasons are mandatory gates.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.6 ULTRA-RARE FOOD RULES

Ultra-Rare food follows same rules as Ultra-Rare enchants:

- Globally tracked
- 1-in-X drop sources
- Never mass-producible
- Buffs only 3–5% stronger
- Cosmetic flavor text
- No inflation
- No power spikes
- No raid-breaking performance

Ultra-Rare cooking is prestige, not performance.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.7 ECONOMIC SAFETY RULES

### 8.7.1 No Vendor Flooding

Vendors may NOT sell high-tier dishes.

### 8.7.2 High-Tier Ingredients Are Rare

Rare meats come from:

- Rare creatures
- Dungeon beasts
- Seasonal nodes

No easy supply.

### 8.7.3 No Bulk Crafting

No multi-craft.

Each meal = individual craft.

Classic pain is required.

### 8.7.4 High-Tier Meals Require Travel

Many dishes can only be cooked at specific hearths or environments.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.8 CLASS IDENTITY PROTECTION

Cooking CANNOT override class fantasy by giving:

- Mobility
- Stealth
- Parry/block
- Spirit Binder-style regen
- Highlander toughness
- Witch spell scaling
- Hunter accuracy bonuses beyond Classic levels

Food supplements the class, not enhances it.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.9 FUTURE-PROOFING RULESET

Any future Cooking patch must follow:

### Rule 1 — No New Stat Categories

Only:

STA / STR / AGI / SPI / Resist / Armor / Regen

Nothing else may be added.

### Rule 2 — No Exceeding Power Caps

New meals cannot surpass the existing ceilings.

### Rule 3 — No Automation

No mass cooking.

No batch prep.

No smart-crafting.

### Rule 4 — No Magic

Food is food.

If the effect sounds magical → reject.

### Rule 5 — Ultra-Rares Stay Fixed

Global limits never increase.
