# CHAPTER 10 — APPENDIX E — GATHERING, NODE SYSTEM & MATERIAL ACQUISITION

---

World Nodes, Spawn Rules, & Ultra-Rare Integration

# E.0 PURPOSE

This appendix defines how:

- Gathering nodes spawn
- Materials drop by tier
- Ultra-Rare items appear
- Professions interact with the world
- Normal → Rare → Elite → Rare Elite → Boss ecosystem determines materials

This is the canonical rulebook for resource acquisition.

---

# E.1 GATHERING PROFESSIONS (FINAL LIST)

Gathering professions are:

1. Mining – ores, crystals, fossil veins
2. Herbalism – herbs, mosses, rare blossoms
3. Skinning – hides, pelts, scales
4. Foraging – mushrooms, roots, rare organic clusters
5. Fishing – aquatic items, rare caches

Each has:

- 1–300 skill (Classic model)
- Chance to fail if under-leveled
- Zone-level banding (low areas = low materials)

---

# E.2 NODE FAMILIES

Every gatherable thing belongs to one of these node families:

### 1. Mineral Nodes

Copper-Steel

Iron

Dense Iron

Crystal-Touched Ore

Crownsteel

First-Forge (Ultra-Rare)

### 2. Herb Nodes

Lowland Sprouts

Bitterbloom

Embercap

Glowweave

Starlit Herb (Ultra-Rare)

### 3. Hide/Harvest Sources

Normal beasts → Tattered Hide

Rare → Huntmaster Leather

Elite → Hardened Pelts

Rare Elite → Ancient Hornplate

Boss → Primal Bone Core

Ultra-Rare → Ethereal Stagbone

### 4. Forage Clusters

Common mushrooms

Rare roots

Elite fungi

Ultra-Rare  → Time-Twinge Root

### 5. Fishing Pools

Common

Rare

Elite

Ultra-Rare “Jackpot” pools

Zone-specific treasure chests

---

# E.3 MATERIAL RARITY TIERS (FINAL)

Permanent system.

### Tier 0 – Basic (Normal Mobs / Low Nodes)

- Tattered Hide
- Lowland Ore
- Simple Herbs

### Tier 1 – Standard (Normal / Rare)

- Huntmaster Leather
- Copper-Steel Ore
- Bitterbloom

### Tier 2 – Enhanced (Elite)

- Hardened Beast Bone
- Dense Iron
- Embercap

### Tier 3 – Elite (Rare Elite)

- Ancient Hornplate
- Crystal-Touched Ore
- Glowweave Herb

### Tier 4 – Boss Materials (Boss Only)

- Primal Bone Core
- Crownsteel Chunk
- Bossheart Resin

### Tier 5 – Ultra-Rare (Global 1-of-X)

- First-Forge Ore
- Starlit Essence
- Ethereal Stagbone
- Time-Twinge Fiber

Power:

+5–8% better than Tier 3 equivalents,

NEVER stronger than Boss gear.

Purpose:

Prestige, cosmetics, niche crafting.

Tracking:

Server-wide “1 of X” count so these items feel legendary.

---

# E.4 NODE SPAWN RULES

Nodes obey a strict Classic-like system:

### 1. Zone Banding

Zones have tiered node tables:

- Low zones spawn Tier 0–1
- Mid zones spawn Tier 1–2
- High zones spawn Tier 2–3
- Danger zones spawn Tier 3–4
- Ultra-Rare can spawn in ANY zone at astronomically low chance

### 2. One-for-One Respawn

When a node is harvested:

- It despawns
- A node of the same node family respawns somewhere else in the same region
- Prevents farming one spot infinitely

### 3. Node Weighting

Common nodes = high weight

Rare nodes = low weight

Elite nodes = extremely low weight

Ultra-Rare nodes = microscopic weight (1 in tens/hundreds of thousands)

### 4. Profession Skill Checks

If your skill is too low:

- You fail
- Harvest returns nothing
- Node still despawns
- Encourages proper leveling

---

# E.5 SKINNING & BEAST MATERIALS

Beast tier determines the hide/bone output:

### Normal → Tier 0–1

### Rare → Tier 1

### Elite → Tier 2

### Rare Elite → Tier 3

### Boss → Tier 4

### Ultra-Rare Beast Roll → Tier 5

(Tie into your rare creature system)

Ultra-Rare beast materials follow the same 1-of-X global logic.

---

# E.6 FORAGING RULES

Foraging is the most system-flexible:

- Normal grasses/mushrooms → Tier 0–1
- Rare roots → Tier 1
- Elite clusters → Tier 2
- Rare Elite fungi → Tier 3
- Ultra-Rare clusters → Tier 5

Forage nodes tend to be hidden, cave-based, or in tight overgrown areas.

---

# E.7 FISHING SYSTEM

Classic logic:

- Fishing requires depth and zone-level
- Pools have rarity
- Some pools are time-limited
- Fish can produce:
    - Cooking items
    - Alchemy reagents
    - Profession materials
    - Ultra-Rare special catches

### Fish Tier Mapping

- Normal Pools → Tier 0–1
- Rare Pools → Tier 1–2
- Elite Pools → Tier 2–3
- Ultra-Rare “Jackpot Pools” → Chance for Tier 5

### Ultra-Rare Fishing Drops

Can be:

- First-Forge Ore
- Starlit Essence
- Ethereal Stagbone
- Time-Twinge Fiber
- Ultra-Rare cosmetic recipes
- Ultra-Rare pets (if allowed)

These follow the 1-of-X global counter.

---

# E.8 ULTRA-RARE DROP SYSTEM (FINAL)

Ultra-Rare items follow the strongest ruleset in Emberwild:

### 1. Never tied to specific creatures

Any valid activity can roll Ultra-Rare:

- Harvesting nodes
- Fishing
- Skinning
- Rare Elite kills
- Boss kills
- Foraging
- Cooking (special crits)
- Exploration triggers

### 2. Global “1-of-X” system

Every Ultra-Rare item:

- Has a global count (e.g., 1-of-500,000)
- Once count is met, no more drop until world respawn cycle
- Prevents flooding the server

### 3. Only slightly stronger

+5–8% over Tier 3 items

NEVER better than Boss gear

Mostly cosmetic, prestige, and trade value

### 4. Visual Distinction

Ultra-Rare items ALWAYS have:

- Unique name color
- Subtle particle/aura shader
- Special flavor text
- Mini icon overlay marking it as global-rare

---

# E.9 NODE SECURITY & ANTI-EXPLOIT RULES

- Nodes cannot spawn in unreachable areas
- Nodes have a 1–3 min protection after spawning before visible
- No two Ultra-Rare nodes spawn within 300–500m of each other
- No dynamic respawn scaling based on population
- No forced “catch-up” mechanics

Grounded, Classic, static.

---

# E.10 END-TO-END GATHERING LOOP

1. Explore → find nodes
2. Harvest → node despawns
3. Replacement node spawns elsewhere
4. Material tier depends on zone & node type
5. Ultra-Rare rolls are always astronomically low
6. Gathered materials feed into Tiered Crafting (Appendix D)
7. Crafted goods power early/mid progression but never outclass Boss gear

---

# E.11 SUMMARY

This is the final, corrected, and fully compatible version of the gathering/material system.

It now:

- Uses ONLY Normal/Rare/Elite/Rare Elite/Boss/Ultra-Rare
- Supports Ultra-Rare prestige items without power creep
- Mirrors Classic systems but grounded to Emberwild
- Fully aligns with Chapters 1–10
