# CHAPTER 26 — FISHING

### SECTION 1 — PROFESSION OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1 PROFESSION FANTASY — THE ART OF STILLNESS

Fishing in Emberwild is a Classic-era, slow, atmospheric gathering profession focused on patience, timing, weather, and location.

It is deliberately unglamorous, quiet, and rooted in natural rhythm — the opposite of combat professions.

Fishing is:

- a lifestyle craft, not a production craft
- a core supplier for Cooking and Alchemy
- a world exploration profession
- one of the main sources of Ultra-Rare world items
- slow, peaceful, and deeply immersive
- built on weather, season, water type, bait, and gear

Fishing is NOT:

- a power-crafting profession
- a combat enhancer
- a stat-boost generator
- a fast gold-making method
- a source of magic or spells

Fishing is the most Classic profession in Emberwild, intentionally slow and ritualistic.

Visual fantasy:

- rippling water
- drifting fog
- rods of carved wood and bone
- lantern light reflecting on riverbanks
- storm-lit silhouettes on a coastline
- rare fish shimmering in moonlight

Identity pillars:

- Patience over speed
- Knowledge over power
- Atmosphere over efficiency
- Discovery over repetition
- Rarity over quantity

Fishing exists to create moments, not mechanics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1.2 ROLE WITHIN THE WORLD

Fishing supports three core world systems:

### A. Food & Sustenance (Cooking Synergy)

Fishing provides:

- basic protein for leveling meals
- high-tier fish for endgame feasts
- rare fish for specialized stat foods
- seasonal specialties

Cooking depends on Fishing the same way Enchanting depends on Disenchanting.

### B. Apothecary & Alchemy (Reagent Source)

Fish create:

- oils
- gland extracts
- chemical reagents
- solvents
- toxins (rare)

These feed Alchemy’s potions, solutions, and flasks.

### C. Ultra-Rare Discovery Mechanic

Fishing is one of Emberwild’s top-tier Ultra-Rare generators.

Catches include:

- rare spirit pearls
- ancient containers
- leviathan fragments
- world-currency collectibles
- ultra-rare cooking ingredients
- enchanting catalysts

Fishing produces world-famous moments.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1.3 THEMATIC PILLARS

Fishing’s identity is built on the following design pillars:

### Stillness

The player slows down; the world’s atmosphere becomes the gameplay.

### Patience

Rare catches require long-term commitment.

### Knowledge of Waters

Each fish is tied to:

- region
- time of day
- weather
- season
- bait

Knowledge = power.

### Danger in Exploration

Fishing spots may be:

- guarded by predators
- inside Rare Elite zones
- along cliffside coasts
- within storm systems

Fishing can be peaceful — not always safe.

### Classic Randomness

1-in-X probabilities, no pity systems, pure RNG.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1.4 PLAYSTYLE OF THE PROFESSION

Fishing is a non-linear profession that naturally fits leveling pacing.

### Low Level (1–75)

- junk-heavy catches
- simple fish for beginner meals
- low-skill bait
- slow, forgiving pacing
- player learns weather/terrain basics

### Mid Level (75–150)

- regional specialization begins
- larger fish require stronger rods
- predator fish appear
- night-specific and fog-specific fish unlock
- seasonal cycles matter
- gold becomes steady but slow

### High Tier (150–225)

- rare fish spawn windows
- deepwater holes
- storm fishing begins
- alchemy-grade reagents drop
- junk dramatically decreases
- competition for spots increases

### Artisan Tier (225–300)

- spirit-realm attunement
- Ultra-Rare tables unlocked
- hidden fishing nodes
- legendary moments
- artifacts, pearls, ancient boxes
- global announcements upon extremely rare catches

Fishing reaches prestige here.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1.5 COMPARATIVE VALUE ACROSS LEVELS

Fishing maintains value across ALL levels:

### 1–10:

- low tier food supply
- training-only
- almost entirely junk

### 11–40:

- cooking economy stabilizes
- alchemy reagents begin to sell
- seasonal events introduce rare fish

### 41–60:

- strongest economic phase
- dungeons require food/oils
- high-tier fish remain valuable
- deepwater nodes unlock

### Endgame (Artisan 225–300):

- Ultra-Rare tables
- world-famous catches
- server-tracked legendary items
- fishing tournaments
- unique spirit-realm pools

Fishing scales for the full lifetime of Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1.6 SOCIAL ROLE

Fishing strongly supports Classic social identity:

- players crowd around lakes
- locations become hubs
- tournament culture forms
- rare catches become legends
- casual players feel rewarded
- dedicated anglers become known

Fishing is one of the few professions where:

- ANYONE can get lucky
- EVEN DEDICATED players cannot guarantee success

This creates community moments.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.1.7 IDENTITY SUMMARY

Fishing is:

- atmospheric
- patient
- exploration-driven
- weather-dependent
- season-bound
- slow
- deeply Classic
- one of three Ultra-Rare professions

It is one of the most iconic professions in Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 2 — SKILL RANKS, GEAR, ROD PROGRESSION & BAIT TIERS

────────────────────────────────────────

This section upgrades your original content into the full v4.3.5 profession standard, providing a Classic-style, grounded, meticulously tiered Fishing progression that matches the depth of Enchanting and Woodworking.

No filler. No fluff.

Just clean, system-ready Fishing design.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.2 SKILL RANKS & TRAINING (1–300 CLASSIC STRUCTURE)

Fishing uses the same Classic 4-tier skill arc as Enchanting:

### Apprentice Angler (1–75)

Learned in starter towns.

Catches mostly junk and small common fish.

### Journeyman Angler (75–150)

Learned in regional villages.

Unlocks:

- uncommon fish
- weather-dependent species
- better bait

### Expert Angler (150–225)

Learned from coastal or river hermits.

Unlocks:

- storm fishing
- night shoals
- rare fish
- deepwater holes

### Artisan Angler (225–300)

Taught only by wandering elders or remote fishing masters.

Unlocks:

- ultra-rare catch tables
- spirit realm pools
- legendary fish
- fishing artifacts

### Skill Progression Notes

Fishing skill increases by:

- catching fish
- catching junk
- discovering new nodes
- landing rare catches (bonus skill)

Skill increases slow dramatically after 200 — intentionally Classic.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.3 FISHING RODS — PROGRESSION & POWER

Fishing rods determine:

- catch difficulty success
- cast distance
- bite speed
- junk reduction
- rare catch modifier (low but meaningful)
- durability (Classic-style degradation)

### Tier 1 — Simple Reed Rod

Skill Range: 1–75

Crafted by Woodworkers or bought cheap.

Stats:

- slow bite rate
- high junk chance
- shallow cast range

### Tier 2 — Carved Oak Rod

Skill Range: 75–150

Moderate midgame rod.

Stats:

- reduces junk
- increases uncommon fish chance
- handles predator pulls

### Tier 3 — Reinforced Steel Rod

Skill Range: 150–225

High-tier rod for Expert fishermen.

Stats:

- required for rare fish
- resistant to storm-fishing stress
- reduces line snaps
- moderate rare catch chance

### Tier 4 — Elderwood Rod (Ultra-Rare)

Skill Range: 225–300

Obtained via:

- Ultra-Rare fishing
- rare spirit realm event
- world treasure chain

Stats:

- highest catch control
- significantly reduces junk
- slightly increases Ultra-Rare odds (Classic 0.05–0.15% mod)
- does NOT guarantee anything
- trophy item with prestige

Elderwood Rod = the fishing equivalent of a legendary enchant rod.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.4 LINE, HOOKS & TOOLS

### Fishing Line Grades

- Frayed Line — starter line, snaps often
- Braided Riverline — +durability
- Stormthread Line — crafted from rare storm fibers, reduces snap chance during storms
- Silkbound Spiritline — spirit realm rare, used for Ultra-Rare fishing

### Hooks

Hooks determine bite conversion success:

- Rusty Hook — junk-tier
- Iron Hook — standard
- Barbed Hook — reduces escape chance
- Spirit Hook — rare; increases chance of spectral fish

### Utility Tools

- Fishing Knife — gutting fish, obtaining reagents
- Gutting Board — supports large-fish processing
- Line Repair Kit — durability repair
- Lantern — necessary for night fishing

Tools degrade but are cheap to repair.

Higher-tier tools have minimal bonuses to stability.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.5 BAIT TIERS & SPECIALIZATIONS

Bait defines:

- catch rate
- fish type
- rarity windows
- zone specialization
- predator attraction
- night/day function

Fishing WITHOUT bait is viable at early Apprentice levels only.

### Tier 1 — Basic Bait (1–75)

- Worms (universal)
- Grubs (slightly improved bite rate)
- Insect Clumps (swamp)

### Tier 2 — Specialized Bait (75–150)

- Glow Bait (night-only fish)
- River Shrimp (river carnivores)
- Minnow Jars (coastal fish)

### Tier 3 — Exotic Bait (150–225)

- Blood Bait (predators)
- Ironflake Bait (mineral-fed rare species)
- Frost Midge Bait (frozen lake species)

### Tier 4 — Legendary Bait (225–300)

Obtained via:

- rare creatures
- spirit realm
- Ultra-Rare loot

Types:

- Spiritflesh Lure
- Astral Glow Worm
- Leviathan Tendon Sliver

These bait types:

- greatly reduce junk
- increase rare odds slightly
- unlock spirit realm-exclusive species

NEVER guarantee rare or Ultra-Rare fish.

Classic RNG always respected.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 26.6 GEAR LOCATION RULES

Certain rods, baits, and lines ONLY function in:

- specific biomes
- frozen lakes
- storm waters
- deepwater chasms
- spirit realm pools

This reinforces exploration identity.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 3 — ENVIRONMENTS, WEATHER SYSTEMS, SEASONS & NODE LOGIC

────────────────────────────────────────

This section is the full v4.3.5 environmental simulation layer — identical in depth to your Rare Creature ecosystem + Cooking biome logic.

Fishing in Emberwild is driven by where, when, and how the player fishes.

No filler. Pure systems.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3 ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS OVERVIEW

Fishing is controlled by four interlocking systems:

1. Water Type System
2. Time-of-Day System
3. Weather System
4. Seasonal Cycle System

Each system modifies:

- catch tables
- rarity odds
- junk rates
- node spawn behavior
- predator danger

These modifiers follow Classic MMO RNG philosophy — small influences, never guarantees.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3.1 WATER TYPES (THE FOUNDATION)

Every catch in Emberwild belongs to one of six water families:

### A. Rivers

Characteristics:

- fast-bite rate
- small → mid fish
- high debris chance
- ideal for alchemy reagents
- storms cause dangerous currents

Special features:

- migrating fish
- river predators

### B. Lakes

Characteristics:

- stable bite rate
- peaceful environment
- common → rare fish
- best place to train 1–150

Special features:

- deepwater pockets
- seasonal bloom events

### C. Swamps

Characteristics:

- high junk rate
- unique swamp-exclusive species
- toxic fish for alchemy
- dangerous wildlife

Special features:

- fog increases rare catch chance
- special bait required for many species

### D. Coastlines

Characteristics:

- wide fish variety
- storm-dependent rares
- large predator fish
- more skill required

Special features:

- tide cycle
- dawn/dusk species

### E. Frozen Lakes

Characteristics:

- slow bite rate
- very low junk
- high-value coldwater species
- ice fractures as danger events

Special features:

- weather-sensitive
- rare frost-aligned alchemy fish

### F. Deepwater Holes (Hidden Nodes)

Characteristics:

- extremely rare
- high difficulty
- rare → Ultra-Rare tables
- guarded by Rare Elites

Special features:

- only visible with 150+ skill
- some require specific baits
- storms increase the chance they spawn

Deepwater Holes are your profession’s equivalent of Rare Creature spawn points.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3.2 TIME-OF-DAY SYSTEM (DYNAMIC CATCH ROTATION)

Time-of-day adds Classic-style catch restrictions.

### Dawn (4 AM – 7 AM)

- increased activity
- insect-feeding species
- low predator risk
- good training period

### Day (7 AM – 5 PM)

- common fish dominate
- good for Cooking supply
- less rare fish
- safest period

### Dusk (5 PM – 8 PM)

- rare fish windows begin
- increased bite speed
- predators appear

### Night (8 PM – 4 AM)

- highest rare fish chance
- highest junk reduction
- unique ghostly species
- some Ultra-Rare tables active
- predator danger highest

Night fishing is high risk, high reward.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3.3 WEATHER SYSTEM (CLASSIC MODIFIERS)

Fishing is heavily affected by weather.

These bonus values are system-level modifiers, not absolute changes.

### Clear Skies

- more common fish
- lowest junk
- lowest rare chance

### Rain

- faster bite speed
- moderate rare chance
- slightly higher junk

### Fog

- rare chance significantly increased
- uncommon fish reduced
- high-risk areas

Fog = the “Classic rare window.”

### Storm (Thunder)

- storm-exclusive species
- major rare chance boost
- line break chance increases
- predators highly active
- necessary for some Ultra-Rare catches

Storm fishing is the “heroic content” of the profession.

### Heavy Snow (Northern Regions / Highlands)

- reduced bite rate
- exclusive coldwater species
- rare frost reagents
- dangerous terrain

### Windstorms (Coastal)

- high junk
- high rare chance
- only Steel or Elderwood rods viable

Weather ensures Fishing never becomes solved or static.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3.4 SEASONAL CYCLES (FOUR FULL LOOPS)

Seasons create long-term identity and value:

### Spring (Bloom Season)

- spawning fish
- many common → uncommon fish available
- increased alchemy gland drops
- best time to train 1–125

### Summer (Heat Season)

- low tide windows
- predator fish migrate in
- storm activity increases
- rare fish dominate at night

### Autumn (Migration Season)

- fish move through rivers in large groups
- highest uncommon catch frequency
- cooking feasts rely heavily on autumn fish

### Winter (Freeze Season)

- frozen lakes open special nodes
- slow bite rates
- highest-value catches
- frost reagents
- dangerous cold hazards

Seasonal cycles rotate over 30–40 hours of real-time, Classic style.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3.5 NODE LOGIC (SPAWN SYSTEM)

Fishing nodes follow your Rare Creature respawn logic:

### Common Nodes

- always present
- low value
- no competition

### Uncommon Nodes

- small clusters
- 3–5 minute respawns
- region-dependent

### Rare Nodes

- appear based on:
    - time
    - weather
    - season
    - player proximity
    - hidden spawn seeds

### Deepwater Holes (Elite Nodes)

- only visible at 150+ skill
- dangerous locations
- require reinforced rods
- rare/ultra-rare tables

### Spirit Pools (Artisan-Only)

Located in the Spirit Realm:

- fade in/out
- contain spectral fish
- have 0 junk chance
- extremely rare

These nodes directly support Ultra-Rare crafting and rituals.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.3.6 PREDATOR & DANGER EVENTS

Fishing is not safe. Events include:

### River Snatchers

- steal caught fish
- knockback
- low-level danger

### Coastal Predators

- attack when player hooks predator fish
- combat required

### Swamp Ambushes

- insects
- toxic creatures
- stealth predators

### Storm Hazard

- lightning strikes
- rod instability
- forced movement

### Frozen Lake Fractures

- player falls in
- hypothermia debuff
- forced exit

Danger creates immersion and keeps fishing from being brainless.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 4 — CATCH CATEGORIES, RARITY TABLES, LOOT LOGIC & ULTRA-RARE SYSTEM

────────────────────────────────────────

This is the core loot engine of Fishing in Emberwild, rewritten to modern v4.3.5 standards:

- Classic rarity curve
- Global Ultra-Rare tracking
- Biome-linked rarity tables
- Weather/day/season modifiers
- Spirit Realm integration
- Loot category structure identical to Cooking, Enchanting, Engineering

No fluff — pure system logic.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.4 CATCH CATEGORIES — THE 5-TIER SYSTEM

Fishing yields items in five structured rarity tiers:

1. Common Fish
2. Uncommon Fish
3. Rare Fish
4. Exotic Fish (High-Rare Tier)
5. Ultra-Rare Catches (globally tracked)

This system mirrors Classic WoW but is fully tuned to Emberwild’s pacing.

────────────────────────────────────────

- large fish require gutting boards

Processing tier is tied to fish rarity.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 5 — DEBRIS, CONTAINERS, SPECIAL FINDS & SPIRIT-REALM FISHING

────────────────────────────────────────

This section expands the non-fish portion of Fishing — the Classic charm, the exploration layer, and the treasure-hunting fantasy that makes the profession more than just catching creatures.

It mirrors the depth of Enchanting’s disenchanting tables + Woodworking’s salvage system, but grounded in Fishing flavor.

No talking. Pure content.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.5 DEBRIS SYSTEM — CLASSIC “JUNK” LOOP (UPGRADED 4.3.5)

Debris exists for:

- world flavor
- low-tier material recycling
- rare discoveries
- engineering salvage
- enchanting fodder
- Classic MMO nostalgia

Debris is never worthless.

Even “junk” feeds the economy.

### 5.1 Debris Categories

Fishing debris is divided into three tiers:

---

## TIER 1 — COMMON DEBRIS

Appears mostly during:

- low skill
- daytime
- clear weather

---

## TIER 3 — RARE DEBRIS (“Classic Treasures”)

Rare debris is the heart of Classic fishing fantasy.

Sources:

- deepwater
- storms
- night shoals
- frozen cracks
- spirit realm crossfade

Examples:

- Weather-Sealed Parchment Tube
- Lost Merchant’s Ledger
- Rust-Sealed Chest Fragment

Uses:

- crafting reagents
- quest items
- maps
- Ultra-Rare fishing baits
- cosmetic trophies

Classic design = great drops hidden inside junk.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.5.2 CONTAINERS — FISHABLE TREASURE LOOT TABLES

Fishing yields three tiers of containers.

All containers obey Classic / Emberwild rules:

- no combat gear
- no power creep
- no stat items
- purely utility, cosmetic, or crafting

---

## TIER 1 — WATERLOGGED CHESTS

Contain:

- low-tier materials
- cooking spices
- basic coins

- repair kits

Drop chance:

- 2–5% on rivers/lakes

---

## TIER 2 — BARNACLE-COVERED CRATES

Contain:

- uncommon materials
- woodworking scraps
- engineering cogs
- map fragments
- storm reagents
- alchemy oils

Drop chance:

- 1–3% coastal or deepwater

---

## TIER 3 — ANCIENT CONTAINERS (RARE)

Contain:

- rare crafting materials
- quest items
- lore pages
- unique cosmetics
- Ultra-Rare bait
- spirit-attuned reagents
- rare engineering schematics
- enchanted cosmetic items (non-stat)

Drop chance:

- 0.05–0.15%
- doubled during storms
- tripled in Spirit Pools

These crates define the “Classic treasure fishing” feel.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.5.3 SPECIAL FINDS — NON-FISH RARE LOOT

Special finds are ultra-rare drops in their own category.

Examples:

### 1. Lost Expedition Journals

- reveal mini-lore
- lead to treasure spots
- form collectable sets

### 2. Worn Spirit Hooks

- allow Spirit Pool interaction
- rare, valuable

### 3. Ancient Bone Lures

- used for predator fishing
- high-value crafting

### 4. Starpearl Clusters

- enchanting cosmetic items
- used for visual-only enchants

### 5. Leviathan Tooth Fragment

- used in legendary cooking
- 1-in-X exclusive

These finds help Fishing remain one of Emberwild’s most atmospheric professions.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.5.4 SPIRIT-REALM FISHING SYSTEM

The Spirit Realm (via Eye mechanic) introduces a profession-only endgame layer.

### Requirements

- 225+ Fishing
- spirit vision active
- correct bait (Spiritflesh, Astral Glow Worm)
- correct rod (Steel minimum; Elderwood recommended)

---

## SPIRIT POOLS

Spirit Pools appear:

- randomly
- faintly glowing
- flickering in/out of vision
- similar to rare creature phasing

Properties:

- 0% junk chance
- 80% uncommon+
- exotic and spectral fish
- Ultra-Rare odds doubled (still tiny)
- hostile spirit fish can attack

Examples of Spirit Fish:

- Ghostfin Mirage
- Echo-Scaled Sentry
- Luminous Tide Wraith
- Riftbelly Drifter

Uses:

- enchanting cosmetic reagents
- cooking feast-tier items
- woodworking spirit shavings
- alchemy spectral oils

Spirit fishing is dangerous but lucrative, balancing the profession at the high end.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.5.5 DANGER EVENTS UNIQUE TO SPIRIT-FISHING

Fishing while in the Spirit Realm includes:

### Spectral Bites

Fish attempt to “drag” the player

(slow or stun effects)

### Wraith-Lunge Events

Spirit predators lunge from the pool

### Spirit Erosion

Staying too long near a pool drains stamina/focus

### Phase Collapse

Pool disappears during cast → line snaps

These dangers mirror the high-risk logic of Rare Hunts.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 6 — ECONOMIC ROLE, MARKET FLOW, GOLD SINKS & SERVER-LIFETIME VALUE

────────────────────────────────────────

Fishing is a slow-burn economic profession, intentionally designed to create stable, continuous resource flow without ever flooding the market or breaking Emberwild’s Classic economy.

This section defines Fishing’s monetary structure, server impact, gold sinks, and long-term relevance.

No fluff. Pure economic architecture.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6 ECONOMIC MISSION OF FISHING

Fishing fulfills four long-term economic purposes:

## 1 — Sustain Cooking

Fishing is the primary food supply chain:

- low-tier meals
- mid-tier regen foods
- endgame feast-tier dishes
- seasonal food with unique effects

Cooking cannot function without Fishing.

## 2 — Feed Alchemy

Fish supply:

- oils
- glands
- toxins
- solvents
- chemical components

Alchemy relies on Fishing the same way Engineering relies on Woodworking.

## 3 — Support Engineering

Fishing debris & special finds supply:

- rusted metal
- tool fragments
- salvageable casing parts
- lubricants
- rare storm reagents

These support Engineering’s mid-tier schematics.

## 4 — Anchor Ultra-Rare Economy

Fishing is one of the three Ultra-Rare pillars, alongside:

- Rare Creature hunts
- Spirit Realm anomalies
- Enchanting crystal events

Fishing is the most accessible but slowest Ultra-Rare source.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.1 GOLD SINK STRUCTURE

Fishing is a net gold sink profession.

It passively drains gold through:

## A. Tools & Rod Durability

Rods degrade:

- faster in storms
- faster in spirit pools
- faster with predator bites

Repairing rods & metallic hooks = core gold sink.

## B. Bait Purchases

Bait is intentionally:

- limited
- expensive at higher tiers
- lost on use

Exotic bait → consistent gold drain.

## C. Travel Costs

Fishing loops require:

- long travel
- multiple biomes
- boats (if owned)
- fast-travel fees

This keeps players moving and spending.

## D. Container Unlock Costs

Some containers require:

- locksmith NPCs
- engineering tools
- extraction fees

Example:

- Ancient containers cost 20–75s to open.

## E. Cold-Weather Survival Gear

Frozen lakes force:

- anti-freeze salves
- insulated clothing repairs
- campfire purchases

Fishing is not free.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.2 MATERIAL-CIRCUIT ECONOMY (THE “CLASSIC LOOP”)

Fishing uses a closed-loop ecosystem:

Fish → Processing → Ingredients → Cooking/Alchemy → Player Progression → More Fishing → Market Flow

This loop:

- never inflates
- never collapses
- supports all levels
- maintains Classic pacing

### Key Impacts

- early-game common fish remain relevant
- seasonal fish create predictable market spikes
- rare fish create gold bursts
- Ultra-Rares create server lore

Everything feels meaningful but never overwhelming.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.3 MATERIAL DEMAND CURVE (ALL TIERS STAY RELEVANT)

Fishing avoids the “dead-tier” problem other MMOs have:

### Common Fish Demand

- constant for Cooking
- constant for low-tier regen foods
- always bought by leveling players

### Uncommon Fish Demand

- spikes during:
    - seasonal feasts
    - mid-tier alchemy demand
    - group content

### Rare Fish Demand

- strongest market value
- used for endgame Cooking & Alchemy
- sells quickly due to dungeon prep

### Exotic Fish Demand

- feast-tier recipes
- used in engineering lubricants
- tied to unique alchemy oils

### Ultra-Rare Demand

- global prestige economy
- collectors
- high-net-worth players
- guild auctions

This ensures every tier matters and remains sellable.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.4 SUPPLY-SIDE REALISM (NO OVERPRODUCTION)

To prevent market inflation:

### Rod wear slows infinite farming

Better rods = more expensive repairs.

### Bait scarcity limits output

Special baits are restricted by:

- vendors
- seasonal cycles
- rare drops

### Weather & season gate access

Players cannot farm rare fish all day.

### Danger events prevent AFK loops

Fishing is non-automatable by natural world design.

### Spirit Pools are limited

Guaranteed scarcity.

Fishing stays tight and controlled.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.5 PLAYER-TO-PLAYER MARKET LOOPS

Fishing influences nearly all market layers:

## A. Cooking Loop

Players buy:

- fillets
- fish meat
- feast ingredients

## B. Alchemy Loop

Players buy:

- fish oils
- nerve glands
- storm glands
- toxic sacs

## C. Engineering Loop

Players buy:

- rusted metals
- line hooks
- storm scraps
- ancient casings

## D. Cosmetic/Collectible Loop

Players buy:

- trophy fish mounts
- spirit fish illusions
- decorative aquarium items
- lore container items

Fishing becomes a social profession due to trade variety.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.6 SERVER-LIFETIME VALUE

Fishing remains valuable forever because:

- season cycles never stop
- cooking always matters
- alchemy demand never decreases
- Ultra-Rare items remain collectible
- spirit pools rotate permanently
- containers never lose flavor value
- rare fish anchor dungeon prep
- catch tables remain broad and deep

Fishing’s value curve:

- smooth
- stable
- evergreen

This is the longest-lasting gathering profession in Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.7 FACTION & REPUTATION ECONOMICS

Nothing modern — pure Classic:

### Factions offer:

- region-specific baits
- rare rod components
- ancient maps
- unique container keys
- cosmetic fishing hats/cloaks

Players must travel, grind rep, and engage with the world’s fishing culture.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.8 INTER-PROFESSION SYNERGY

Fishing synergizes with:

### Cooking

Primary supply chain.

### Alchemy

Core reagent provider.

### Engineering

Debris and storm scraps.

### Woodworking

Rod crafting, gutting boards, line handles.

### Enchanting

Ultra-Rare pearls/scales for cosmetic enchants.

Fishing is embedded within the entire profession ecosystem.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 26.6.9 ECONOMIC STABILITY LAWS

Fishing must obey Classic economy rules:

✔ No vendor sells rare fish

✔ No automated fishing tools

✔ No infinite bait loops

✔ Seasonal supply remains limited

✔ Deepwater nodes remain rare

✔ Spirit Pools cannot be farmed repeatedly

✔ Ultra-Rares remain globally scarce

This keeps Fishing permanently grounded.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 7 — PROFESSION QUESTLINE: THE ANGLER’S PATH

Classic-Era, Slow, Atmospheric, Exploration-Based

────────────────────────────────────────

This is the full Fishing profession questline — paced exactly like Classic WoW’s Artisan quests, but with Emberwild’s deeper worldbuilding, weather systems, rare pools, storm events, and Ultra-Rare identity.

No fluff. Pure narrative + progression structure.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.0 QUESTLINE PHILOSOPHY

Fishing’s questline must be:

- atmospheric

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 8 — LIMITATIONS, SAFETY RULES & POWER-CAP SYSTEMS

Classic-Era Design • Anti-Exploit • Anti-Power-Creep • Anti-Automation

────────────────────────────────────────

These are the laws of physics for the Fishing profession in Emberwild — the rules that keep it atmospheric, grounded, fair, and immune to power creep or bot-style exploitation.

No fluff. Just the full rule system.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.0 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Fishing obeys three permanent profession laws:

### Law 1 — Atmosphere Over Optimization

Fishing must never become:

- automated
- fast
- predictable
- power-gameable

It must remain:

- slow
- patient
- immersive

### Law 2 — Zero Combat Power

Fishing must not grant:

- combat buffs
- stat bonuses
- damage boosts
- resource regeneration

Cooking uses fish to give regen effects, but fishing itself NEVER grants combat power.

### Law 3 — Classic RNG Boundaries

Fishing uses:

- Classic-style rarity
- Classic pacing
- Classic junk ratios
- Ultra-Rare 1-in-X global tracking

These ratios never increase.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.1 ANTI-AUTOMATION RULESET

Fishing requires:

- active interaction
- moving bobber reticle
- reacting to the “bite” window
- anti-macro timing randomization

Rules:

1. Bite timing slightly varies per cast
2. “Rare bite” window lasts 0.8–1.3 seconds
3. Random micro-drift on bobber position
4. Must recast if tension drops
5. Cannot auto-cast
6. Cannot queue multiple casts

This makes botting nearly impossible.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.2 GEAR LIMITATIONS

### 8.2.1 Fishing Rod Power Caps

Rod tiers cannot exceed:

- +8% bite rate
- +4% rare catch chance
- −10% junk chance
- +5% tension stability

Even Elderwood Rod follows these caps.

### 8.2.2 No Combat Enchantments

Fishing rods cannot be enchanted with:

- attack power
- spell power
- crit
- damage boosts
- utility enchants

Only fishing effects may apply.

### 8.2.3 No Profession Overlap

Fishing rods & tools cannot substitute:

- mining picks
- skinning knives
- combat weapons

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.3 ENVIRONMENT LIMITATIONS

Fishing relies on location → weather → season → time.

### 8.3.1 Location Restrictions

You cannot fish in:

- puddles
- fountains
- rain runoff
- decorative water
- shallow non-fishable pools

### 8.3.2 Weather Restrictions

Storm pools spawn ONLY during:

- active thunderstorms
- fog
- rainstorms

Some fish disappear completely in clear weather.

### 8.3.3 Seasonal Restrictions

Seasonal fish appear ONLY in:

- spring thaw
- autumn migration
- midsummer tide
- winter ice cracks

No off-season farming.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.4 RARITY & POWER CAPS

Fishing rarity must stay grounded and non-abusive.

### 8.4.1 Junk Ratio Boundaries

Classic definition:

- 30–45% junk at low skill
- 15–25% junk mid skill
- 5–10% junk at max skill

Never lower.

### 8.4.2 Rare Catch Power Caps

Rare fish cannot produce:

- combat stats
- permanent buffs
- damage bonuses
- stat food beyond Classic regen categories

### 8.4.3 Ultra-Rare Caps

Ultra-Rare fishing items must:

- remain globally tracked
- be 1-in-X rarity
- NEVER exceed their intended power cap
- follow the “max +5% improvement” rule

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.5 FISHING SKILL GATES

Fishing requires minimum skill per region.

### 8.5.1 Skill → Zone Logic

Skill : Zone

- 1–75: starter towns, rivers
- 75–150: coasts, swamps
- 150–225: storm pools, deepwater
- 225–300: spirit-linked pools

Failing a cast below required skill yields:

- higher junk
- lower catch chance
- 0% rare chance

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.6 BAIT RESTRICTIONS

### 8.6.1 Bait Tier Caps

Bait must not exceed:

- +4% rare chance
- +10% bite rate

Glow bait, blood bait, ironflake bait all follow these caps.

### 8.6.2 No Permanent Buff Baits

No bait can provide:

- combat enhancement
- stat boosts
- movement buffs

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.7 POOL LIMITATIONS

Fishing pools must follow realistic Classic logic.

### 8.7.1 Pool Lifetimes

Pools last:

- 3–7 catches (common)
- 1–3 catches (rare)
- 1 catch only (Ultra-Rare)

### 8.7.2 Pool Spawn Frequencies

Spawn frequencies cannot exceed:

- every 20–40 minutes (rare)
- every 2–6 hours (storm)
- single-digit global rotation (Ultra-Rare)

### 8.7.3 No Player Forcing

Players cannot:

- create pools
- summon pools
- duplicate pools

Only weather + season + world design determines spawns.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.8 ULTRA-RARE LIMITATIONS

Ultra-Rare fishing drops are sacred.

### Rules:

- must obey global scarcity
- cannot be farmed
- cannot respawn quickly
- never come from combat
- cannot be disenchanted into crystals
- cannot be engineered or cooked into OP items

### Ultra-Rare Catch Requirements:

To catch an Ultra-Rare:

- must use Elderwood Rod
- must complete Artisan Questline
- must fish in correct weather + season + time
- must find an Ultra-Rare surge pool

This keeps the chase meaningful.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.9 ECONOMIC LIMITATIONS

Fishing must NOT inflate the economy.

### Forbidden:

- mass-selling goldfish equivalents
- infinite-value catch loops
- vendor-trash exploits
- spawn campable rare pools

### Required:

- slow gold gain
- high effort → moderate reward
- jackpot potential capped at Classic logic
- repair costs on rod/line

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.10 WHY THESE LIMITATIONS EXIST

Fishing must remain:

- peaceful
- atmospheric
- slow
- exciting
- unpredictable
- world-based
- exploration-driven
- low-power
- NA-friendly
- Classic-true

No power creep.

No automation.

No meta abuse.

No shortcut systems.

Fishing stays a pure lifestyle profession.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 9 — FINAL DESIGN CHECKLIST & END-OF-CHAPTER SUMMARY

Classic-Era Identity • Dev Validation • Long-Term Stability

────────────────────────────────────────

This section locks the entire Fishing profession into place.

It follows the same structure as the Class Bibles and the Enchanting/Engineering endcaps — a pure developer-facing ruleset ensuring internal consistency.

────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.1 THE ROLE OF FISHING IN THE GAME WORLD

### 9.1.1 Environmental Immersion Anchor

Fishing reinforces:

- day/night cycle
- storm cycle
- biome identity
- travel pacing
- seasonal rotation
- regional culture

It makes the world feel alive.

### 9.1.2 Lifestyle / Social Profession

Fishing is not about power.

Fishing is about:

- chill moments
- atmosphere
- discovery
- downtime gameplay
- social zones on docks and riverbanks

Fishing becomes a community tradition.

### 9.1.3 The Ultra-Rare Engine

Fishing is one of the three professions that generate Ultra-Rares.

This creates:

- server-wide hype
- prestige
- legendary screenshots
- rare market moments
- symbolic items

Players remember Ultra-Rare catches for years.

### 9.1.4 Cooking, Alchemy, Engineering Synergy

Fishing supplies:

- cooking food
- alchemical reagents
- lubrication oils
- conductive storm materials
- Elderwood rod ritual components

Fishing becomes a subtle backbone of other professions.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.2 DEVELOPER VALIDATION SUITE

Before adding ANY future Fishing change, ask:

### Identity Check

□ Does this maintain fishing as slow, atmospheric, patient content?

□ Does it respect weather / time / zone logic?

### Power Check

□ Does it violate power caps or generate combat power?

□ Does it risk creating a new meta?

### Economy Check

□ Does it inflate gold-per-hour?

□ Does it introduce sellable loops?

### Ultra-Rare Check

□ Does it bypass global scarcity?

□ Does it undermine Elderwood Rod gating?

### Exploit Check

□ Can this be automated?

□ Can this be macro’d?

□ Can this be pooled infinitely?

If any answer is “YES” → reject the change.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.3 PATCH & FUTURE-PROOFING RULES

### Patch Rule 1

No new fishing rod may exceed Elderwood Rod caps.

### Patch Rule 2

New fish must respect Classic rarity tiers:

- common
- uncommon
- rare
- ultra-rare (1-in-X, globally tracked)

### Patch Rule 3

No new bait may exceed +10% bite or +4% rare.

### Patch Rule 4

Seasonal events may add fish, but NOT new power creep.

### Patch Rule 5

No automation features, ever.

### Patch Rule 6

Ultra-Rare totals never increase for a specific item.

────────────────────────────────────────
