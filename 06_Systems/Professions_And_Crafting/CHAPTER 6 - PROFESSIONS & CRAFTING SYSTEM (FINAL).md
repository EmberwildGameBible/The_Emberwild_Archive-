# CHAPTER 6 — PROFESSIONS & CRAFTING SYSTEM (FINAL)

---

### Emberwild: Classic-Style Professions, Material Loops, and Craft Economy

This chapter defines ALL profession logic, gathering systems, and crafting progression across Emberwild.

Nothing in this chapter may contradict Chapters 1–5.

All future profession content must obey the rules here.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

Professions in Emberwild exist to:

- Support survival
- Support the economy
- Support character power in a grounded, Classic-style system
- Provide alternative progression
- Enable long-term goals (gear, tools, consumables, Ultra-Rares, etc.)

Professions are NOT side fluff. They are part of the game’s core loop.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 DESIGN PILLARS OF PROFESSIONS

### 6.1.1 Professions Are Slow, Meaningful, and Resource-Limited

Progression is Classic-like:

- Hard gates
- Slow skill gain
- Expensive high-end crafts
- World-dependent (requires travel)
- No “craft 100 items in 5 sec” automation
- No easy bypasses

### 6.1.2 Professions Serve Roles, Not Metas

Each profession must provide unique power, not power creep.

No profession replaces another.

No profession undermines leveling or dungeons.

### 6.1.3 World Integration Is Mandatory

Gathering nodes, rare ingredients, fishing hotspots, cooking events, etc. all exist physically in the world, not in menus.

Player movement is part of the design.

### 6.1.4 Ultra-Rare Items Integrate Professionally

Certain Ultra-Rare items come from:

- Fishing
- Cooking
- Foraging
- Rare node crits
- Limited trash enemy pools
- Rare creature families
    
    These items use the Hybrid Model (C) for global 1-in-X chances.
    

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 PRIMARY PROFESSION LIST

Professions are split into Gathering, Production, and Support Utility.

### Gathering Professions

1. Hunting & Skinning
2. Mining
3. Herbalism
4. Foraging (mushrooms, roots, wild reagents)
5. Fishing

### Production Professions

1. Cooking
2. Armorsmithing (Mail & Plate focus)
3. Leathersmithing (Cloth & Leather focus)
4. Weaponsmithing
5. Bowyer & Fletching (ranged + ammo + quivers)
6. Alchemy (potions, tonics, oils)

### Support Utility Professions

1. Tinkering (traps, tools, utilities, gadgets)
2. Scribing (recipes, maps, notes, lore pages)
3. Cartography (world map fragments, expeditions)

Players may learn two primary professions, Classic-style.

All gathering professions = unlimited secondary “side” unlocks if desired (design choice remains flexible).

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 PROFESSION SKILL PROGRESSION

### 6.3.1 Skill Levels

Each profession has a skill range:

| Adept | 225–300 |

Max level tied to game expansion phases (future content).

### 6.3.2 Skill Gain Rules

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 FUTURE CONSTRAINTS

Any new profession, recipe, or gathering activity must respect:

1. Classic-style slow progression
2. No profession can replace another
3. All Ultra-Rare integration must follow Hybrid Model brackets
4. No inflation loops
5. No infinite gold or infinite materials
6. No automated crafting
7. No bypassing world travel or social friction
