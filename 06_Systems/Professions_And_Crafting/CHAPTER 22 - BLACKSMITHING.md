# CHAPTER 22 — BLACKSMITHING

---

Classic-Era Profession • Heavy Crafting • Weapons & Armor • Slow & Expensive

Blacksmithing in Emberwild follows the pure Classic WoW philosophy:

- Heavy, resource-intensive
- Long travel routes for ore
- Multiple tool requirements
- Recipes gated behind factions, reputations, and rare elites
- Ultra-Rare world drops
- No modern conveniences
- No inflation or mass production

Blacksmithing is the backbone of heavy armor, weapons, and specialized consumables (sharpening stones, armor plates).

---

# 22.0 PURPOSE OF BLACKSMITHING

Blacksmithing serves three primary goals:

1. Craft high-quality melee/ranged physical gear
    - Swords, axes, maces
    - Polearms
    - Heavy armor (mail/plate as appropriate)
    - Shields (class-appropriate only)
2. Supply essential enhancements
    - Sharpening stones
    - Grinding stones
    - Armor reinforcement kits
    - Weapon tempering agents
3. Long-term specialized items
    - Ultra-Rare patterns
    - Faction-gated gear
    - Unique world-forged artifacts (not overpowered)

Blacksmithing is slow, expensive, and deeply tied to the economy.

---

# 22.1 SKILL RANKS & PROGRESSION

Blacksmithing matches the Classic progression:

- Apprentice Blacksmith (1–75)
- Journeyman Blacksmith (75–150)
- Expert Blacksmith (150–225)
- Artisan Blacksmith (225–300)

Max skill: 300

Training:

- Only available in capital for Expert & Artisan
- Training cost is significant
- Requires the correct tools

---

# 22.2 REQUIRED TOOLS & FORGES

Blacksmithing always requires:

### 22.2.1 Tools

- Blacksmith Hammer (basic)
- Heavy Smithing Hammer (mid-tier)
- Masterwork Forge Hammer (end-tier)

Better tools:

- Reduce craft time
- Reduce failure chance
- Improve durability of crafted items

### 22.2.2 Anvil Requirement

Unlike many professions, Blacksmithing cannot be done anywhere.

Crafting requires:

- Sturdy Anvil (town-level)
- Reinforced Anvil (regional hub)
- Elder Anvil (ancient sites / rare forges)

Some high-end recipes require specific world forges guarded by elites.

---

# 22.3 MATERIALS & HARVESTING

Blacksmithing relies heavily on Mining and world loot.

### 22.3.1 Ores

Classic-style progression:

- Copper
- Tin
- Iron
- Steel
- Rare metals
- Ultra-Rare mineral clusters (very rare)

### 22.3.2 Flux

- Purchased or crafted
- Required for smelting and tempering
- High-tier flux requires Alchemy transmutation

### 22.3.3 Leathers & Woods

Used for:

- Polearm hafts
- Shield grips
- Reinforcements

### 22.3.4 Ultra-Rare Materials

Ultra-Rare metal clusters drop from:

- Rare elites
- Mini-bosses in the world
- Certain environmental nodes
- Low chance from deep mining veins

These materials are:

- Extremely rare, 1-in-X tracked
- Slightly better stat budget (≈ 5%)
- Serve as luxury craft components

---

# 22.4 OUTPUT CATEGORIES

Blacksmithing produces five main item families.

---

## 22.4.1 Weapons

Weapon families craftable:

- One-handed swords
- Two-handed swords
- Axes (1H & 2H)
- Maces (1H & 2H)
- Polearms (including spears)

Weapons follow Chapter 3’s strict rules:

- They must belong to existing weapon families
- They must obey class weapon restrictions
- They must respect physical stat budgets

Weapon tiers scale from:

- Town steel
- Hardened iron
- Cold-forged alloys
- Ancient patterns
- Ultra-Rare blueprints

---

## 22.4.2 Armor

Blacksmiths craft:

- Mail armor sets
- Plate armor sets
- Shields (shield-using classes only)

Armor follows Chapter 1’s ceiling rules:

- No class can equip armor above their maximum
- Blacksmithing does not circumvent these ceilings

Armor types:

- Helm
- Shoulders
- Chest
- Bracers
- Gloves
- Waist
- Legs
- Boots
- Shields (where allowed)

(No cloaks, rings, necklaces—those belong to other systems.)

---

## 22.4.3 Tools & Utility

Blacksmiths produce:

- Mining picks
- Skinning knives
- Sturdy utility tools
- Camp forges (temporary small anvil)
- Field repair kits

Repair kits:

- Restore a small % durability
- Are expensive
- Fit slow economy philosophy

---

## 22.4.4 Consumable Enhancements

Blacksmithing produces Classic-style gear enhancements:

Sharpening Stones

- Increase weapon damage (white damage)
- Stack with oils if explicitly allowed
- Short duration (30 min)

Grinding Stones

- Improve weapon hit or crit depending on tier

Armor Plates

- Flat armor bonuses
- Stack with certain buffs
- No permanent enhancements (must follow Classic philosophy)

Tempering Agents

- Temporary defensive buffs
- Long cooldown; not spammable

---

## 22.4.5 Ultra-Rare Crafts

Ultra-Rare crafts:

- Require Ultra-Rare materials
- Require Ultra-Rare blueprints
- Provide slight stat edge (~5% stronger)
- Never break the game
- Carry cosmetic distinction (metal glow / unique naming tint)

These are prestige items, not power creep.

---

# 22.5 SPECIALIZATIONS (OPTIONAL)

If introduced, specializations follow Classic logic:

- Chosen at skill 200
- Expensive to switch
- Provide access to themed recipes

Possible specializations:

- Weapon Smith
- Armor Smith
- Shield Smith

Not mandatory to include, but Classic-compatible.

---

# 22.6 ECONOMY & PLAYER ROLE

Blacksmiths drive the economy for:

- Tanks (armor, shields)
- Melee DPS (weapons, sharpening stones)
- World explorers (repair kits)
- Miners & Outfitting (synergy)

Blacksmiths are:

- Gold sinks
- Social hubs
- Long-term investment professions

Due to:

- High material cost
- High training cost
- Heavy tool dependency
- Ultra-Rare recipes

---

# 22.7 NPCS, FACTIONS & BLUEPRINT SOURCES

Blueprints come from:

- Vendors (baseline)
- Reputation factions
- Rare elite drops
- Mini-boss caches
- Boss tables
- World Ultra-Rare “1-in-X” drops
- Seasonal events

Blueprint rarity is tied to:

- Danger of region
- Reputation band
- Type of enemy

Ultra-Rare blueprints are:

- Never from dungeons
- Only from world content
- Always globally tracked

---

# 22.8 LIMITATIONS

Blacksmithing cannot:

- Create magical weapons
- Produce cloth, leather, or mail below required class rules
- Bypass durability systems
- Offer infinite-use enhancements
- Replace crafting professions like Enchanting or Engineering

Blacksmithing must:

- Stay slow
- Stay expensive
- Fit Classic progression
- Produce meaningful but not overpowering results

---

# 22.9 CHECKLIST

Every Blacksmith item must:

- Fit stat budgets (Chapter 10)
- Use correct armor/weapon categories
- Respect class schemas
- Use correct materials
- Require a proper tool and forge
- Have realistic crafting requirements
- Allow Ultra-Rare tiers only for world loot + world crafts
