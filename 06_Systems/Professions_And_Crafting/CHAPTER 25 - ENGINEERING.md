# CHAPTER 25 — ENGINEERING (CLASSIC-ERA)

### SECTION 1 — PROFESSION OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

────────────────────────────────────────

Engineering in Emberwild is a high-risk, high-skill, high-cost mechanical craft rooted in Classic-era MMO philosophy.

It is NOT comedic, magical, modern, or sci-fi.

It is a grounded profession of:

- gears
- springs
- pressure valves
- black powder
- precision metalwork
- careful chemical mixtures
- mechanical traps
- analog instruments
- explosive hazards

Engineering is the profession for players who value utility, preparation, and mechanical mastery.

It is intentionally:

- slow
- expensive
- dangerous
- experimental
- skill-based
- role-defining

Engineers build tools that other professions cannot replicate, filling a unique niche in Emberwild’s economy and combat support system.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.1 PROFESSION FANTASY — THE MECHANIST-GUILDSMITH

Engineering represents:

- rugged practicality
- mechanical problem-solving
- experimentation
- controlled explosions
- battlefield ingenuity
- mechanical traps & gadgets
- survival equipment
- siege-style tools

Visual identity:

- brass fittings
- riveted plates
- slow-turning cogs
- pressure gauges
- analog dials
- leather-bound cases
- hand-crafted components (springs, cams, weights)
- realistic bomb satchels
- pneumatic launch tubes
- compact mechanical devices

Engineers are:

- artisans of applied force
- inventors of niche mechanical solutions
- battlefield troubleshooters
- the only source of black-powder explosives
- creators of traps, gadgets, tools, scopes, lenses, and utility devices

They do NOT:

- use magic
- create robots
- build sci-fi gear
- use electricity (beyond primitive arc triggers)
- produce unrealistic modern tech

This is pure Classic Engineering with grounded Emberwild realism.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.2 WHERE ENGINEERING EXCELS

Engineering is strong in:

- Explosives (Classic bombs → radius & damage scaling with skill)
- Utility Tools (flares, signal devices, camp gear)
- Scout Gear (lenses, scopes, viewfinders)
- Mechanical Traps (snares, spring traps, bear traps)
- Hunter & Ranger Synergy (sights, ammo, pressure launchers)
- Dungeon Utility (sapper charges, breach tools)
- Survival Gear (cold gear, climbing spikes, lantern mods)
- Mechanical Consumables (powder packs, fuses, coils)

Engineers also create:

- unique profession-only items
- rare-use consumables
- high-value crafted goods for the market

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.3 WHERE ENGINEERING STRUGGLES

Limitations of Classic-Era Engineering:

- expensive material costs
- high failure chance on explosives
- low resale value until high tiers
- requires mining/smithing support or buying mats
- heavy inventory management
- strict cooldowns on powerful devices
- cannot create raw DPS boosts like Enchanting
- tools often situational, not universal

Engineering is NOT a direct combat profession.

It is a mechanical support toolkit with niche strengths and deliberate weaknesses.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.4 ENGINEERING RESOURCE & MATERIAL FANTASY

Engineering relies on:

### Core Materials

- Iron bars
- Steel bars
- Brass ingots
- Leather straps
- Treated wood
- Springs & coils
- Gears (small/medium/large)
- Black powder
- Fuse wire
- Alchemical oil
- Rivets & bolts
- Treated cloth

### High-End Materials

- Hardened steel
- Precision bearings
- Volatile powder
- Reinforced pipes
- Clockwork springs
- Rare alloys

All items are grounded in realistic metalwork and materials appropriate for a Classic-era world.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.5 TOOL & DEVICE CATEGORIES

Engineers craft multiple types of tools:

### Explosives

- Black powder bombs
- Fragmentation bombs
- Sapper charges
- Breach charges
- Smoke bombs
- Flashpowder devices

### Mechanical Traps

- Bear traps
- Spike snares
- Tripwire traps

### Precision Devices

- Lenses
- Optics
- Weapon scopes (for classes that use marksman gear)
- Mechanical rangefinders

### Ammunition

- Bolts
- Gunpowder charges
- Slugs
- Weighted projectiles
- Hunting darts

All tools follow Classic rules:

- cooldowns
- charges
- high cost
- real danger

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.6 ENGINEERING AS A HIGH-RISK PROFESSION

Engineering preserves Classic WoW’s identity of dangerous crafting:

- explosives have failure rates
- volatile items can misfire
- sapper charges damage the engineer
- misbuilt devices can stun, blind, or knock down the user
- high-end tools require ritual certification or training

This profession is for those who embrace risk.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.7 PLACE IN THE WORLD & ECONOMY

Engineering is a constant utility provider.

### For individuals:

- traps for solo leveling
- explosives for dangerous pulls
- flares for scouting
- tools for survival in harsh biomes

### For groups:

- dungeon breaching
- sapper charges for elite mobs
- smoke tools for repositioning
- flash tools for emergency control
- scopes for ranged builds

### For the server:

- steady demand for devices
- black powder economy
- metal economy
- expedition tools
- seasonal niche demand

Engineering remains relevant forever, because tools are:

- consumed
- situational
- destroyed on use
- tied to dungeon & world mechanics

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 2 — SKILL RANKS, TRAINING, & THE ENGINEERING FAILURE-SAFETY SYSTEM (1–300)

────────────────────────────────────────

Engineering is the single most dangerous profession in Emberwild.

Unlike Enchanting, where the danger is economic, Engineering’s danger is physical, mechanical, explosive, and tied directly to the skill system.

This section defines:

- the full 1–300 Classic progression,
- where each tier is learned,
- what tools unlock,
- how failure/misfire chances work,
- how training is paced,
- and the rules that prevent early abuse of high-tier explosives.

This is the Master Engineering Framework.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.0 OVERVIEW — 1–300 CLASSIC PROGRESSION

Engineering uses the four-tier Classic model:

- Apprentice Engineer (1–75) — Crude Tools Era
- Journeyman Engineer (75–150) — Refined Mechanics Era
- Expert Engineer (150–225) — Precision Engineering Era
- Artisan Engineer (225–300) — Masterwork Mechanica Era

Each tier represents a major jump in risk, cost, and capability.

- dungeon-critical

Artisan Engineering is a status symbol.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.5 THE ENGINEERING FAILURE–SAFETY SYSTEM (CORE RULESET)

Failure is part of Engineering’s identity. This system governs all misfires.

### 2.5.1 Bomb Misfires

A bomb misfire may:

- fizzle (no effect)
- explode early (self damage)
- explode weakly (reduced damage radius)
- smoke-out (blind nearby players 0.5s)

Damage scales with:

- bomb tier
- user proximity
- misfire severity

### 2.5.2 Trap Failures

Trap failures include:

- spring misalignment (trap doesn’t arm)
- partial snap (reduced damage)
- loud snap (alerts nearby enemies)

### 2.5.3 Device Failures

Devices fail by:

- jamming
- firing late
- firing weakly
- consuming double charges

### 2.5.4 Catastrophic Failures (Rare)

Only at Expert+ tiers:

- sapper charges can knock down the engineer
- breach charges can misdirect force
- volatile powder items can ignite prematurely

Catastrophic failures are always rare but possible.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.6 ENGINEERING COOLDOWN SYSTEM

Engineering items obey Classic cooldown logic:

- Bombs: 30–90 sec, depending on tier
- Sapper Charges: 3 min
- Breach Charges: 5 min
- Traps: individual cooldowns + shared 6 sec arming delay
- Devices: usually 1–3 min, depending on type

No stacking, no spamming, no infinite loop.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.7 ENGINEERING TRAINING PHILOSOPHY

- Slow skill gain
- High material cost
- Significant travel between trainers
- High tool investment
- Mandatory specialization (later, in Section 4)
- Dangerous by design

Engineers should feel like the most hardcore craftsmen in Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 3 — TOOLSETS, COMPONENTS & CORE CRAFTING MATERIALS

────────────────────────────────────────

Engineering depends on a structured hierarchy of tools, precision components, and specialized materials.

This section defines the entire backbone of Engineering’s crafting system and serves as the foundation for all later sections (explosives, traps, optics, ammo, mechanical devices, etc.).

Every tool, material, and component stays grounded in Classic-era realism:

- no electricity
- no steam robots
- no magic machinery
- everything mechanical, chemical, and hand-crafted

This section is the Engineering equivalent of Enchanting’s “Dust → Essence → Shard → Crystal” hierarchy.

────────────────────────────────────────

- economic interdependence
- realistic failure curves
- cross-profession trade networks
- engineering identity grounded in material mastery

This is the backbone for all later crafting lists.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 4 — ENGINEERING SPECIALIZATIONS (3 PATHS), BONUSES & IDENTITY SPLIT

────────────────────────────────────────

Classic Engineering becomes truly meaningful only when the player commits to a specialization.

This mirrors Classic WoW’s Goblin vs Gnomish engineering split — but redesigned to fit Emberwild’s grounded, realistic, non-silly engineering fantasy.

You get three specializations, each tied to a different philosophy of mechanical craft.

- Demolitionist — explosives, sapper mastery, breach craft
- Mechanist — traps, mechanical devices, precision tools
- Artificer — optics, survival tools, advanced field equipment

The player chooses ONE specialization at 225 skill and is locked in permanently (Classic rules, no swapping).

Each specialization:

- unlocks exclusive items
- grants unique crafting bonuses
- defines identity in groups
- influences economy value

These paths add depth without breaking realism.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 6 — FAILURE TABLES, COOLDOWNS & SAFETY RULES (FULL CHARTS)

────────────────────────────────────────

Engineering is the only profession in Emberwild that can physically injure the crafter, the party, or the environment when misused.

This section contains the complete, developer-facing mathematical tables that govern:

- failure % by tier
- misfire effects
- cooldown rules
- safety constraints
- explosion radii
- trap arming rules
- charge detonation logic

These rules are locked-in global profession laws, just like the Enchanting slot rules and Classic WoW’s failure/fizzle systems.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 FAILURE TABLES — GLOBAL ENGINEERING MISFIRE CHARTS

Failure rates depend on:

- Engineer skill tier
- Item tier
- Component grade
- Specialization (Demolitionist / Mechanist)

Below are the base rates before specialization bonuses.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 BOMB FAILURE RATES (BY TIER)

| Tier | Skill Range | Item Examples | Base Failure Chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apprentice | 1–75 | crude bombs, oilburst | 18–25% |
| Journeyman | 75–150 | fragmentation, shock | 10–15% |
| Expert | 150–225 | high-yield, accelerant | 7–10% |
| Artisan | 225–300 | master bombs, cluster | 3–6% |

Demolitionist Bonus:

−10% relative reduction to bombs.

Example: 10% → 9%.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 SAPPER / BREACH CHARGE FAILURE RATES

These are intentionally more dangerous, even for masters.

| Charge Type | Skill Tier | Failure Chance | Catastrophic Chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic Sapper Charge | Expert | 10–15% | 2% |
| Advanced Sapper | Expert+ | 8–12% | 3% |
| Breach Charge | Artisan | 8–12% | 4% |
| Master Breach | Artisan (Demo only) | 6–10% | 5% |

Catastrophic Failure Effects:

- self-knockdown
- heavy self-damage
- slight AoE concussive burst
- powder ignition (rare)

These never affect allies beyond soft CC.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 TRAP FAILURE RATES

Base failure is “misalignment” (doesn’t arm, weak snap, or alerts mobs).

| Trap Tier | Skill Range | Base Failure Chance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apprentice | 1–75 | 10–12% |
| Journeyman | 75–150 | 7–9% |
| Expert | 150–225 | 4–6% |
| Artisan | 225–300 | 2–4% |

Mechanist Bonus:

−10% relative reduction to trap failure.

(e.g., 8% → 7.2%.)

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.4 DEVICE FAILURE RATES

Devices are more stable than traps or bombs.

| Device Tier | Failure Chance |
| --- | --- |
| Apprentice | 5–7% |
| Journeyman | 3–5% |
| Expert | 2–3% |
| Artisan | 0–1% |

Optics never misfire, but crafting them can fail.

Artificers have −20% crafting failure on lenses.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.5 CRAFTING FAILURE RULES

Crafting failure = materials lost.

| Tier | Failure Chance |
| --- | --- |
| Apprentice | 20% |
| Journeyman | 12% |
| Expert | 7% |
| Artisan | 4% |
| Ultra-tier (Master optics / breach) | 6–8% |

Specialization Bonuses:

- Demolitionist: −10% bomb crafting failure
- Mechanist: −10% trap crafting failure
- Artificer: −20% optic crafting failure

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.6 EXPLOSION RADII TABLE (STANDARDIZED)

Radii scale by bomb tier:

| Explosive Tier | Radius | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crude Bomb | 3m | weak |
| Fragmentation | 4m | classic small AoE |
| Burstfire / Shock | 5m | cone or stagger |
| High-Yield | 6m | strong AoE |
| Accelerant | 4m (DoT zone 6m) | fire field |
| Sapper Charge | 8m | self-damage guaranteed |
| Breach Charge | 2m (directed) | structural damage |
| Cluster Bomb | 6m main / 2m per sub-bomb | Demo only |

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.7 ENGINEERING COOLDOWN LAWS

All bombs share a general cooldown category.

### 6.7.1 Bomb Cooldowns

- Crude Bombs: 30 sec
- Standard Bombs: 45 sec
- Advanced Bombs: 60 sec
- Master Bombs: 90 sec

### 6.7.2 Charges

- Sapper Charge: 3 min
- Breach Charge: 5 min

### 6.7.3 Traps

- After placement, 6 sec arming delay
- Then 30–45 sec cooldown depending on trap tier

### 6.7.4 Mechanical Devices

- 1–3 min cooldown depending on function

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 TRAP ARMING RULESET

A trap must:

1. Be placed
2. Undergo a 6 sec arming sequence
3. Snap into active mode

If the Engineer moves >4m away during arming → 50% chance of misalignment.

Elites have small chance to resist trap effects (0–6% depending on trap tier).

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.9 BREACH SYSTEM RULES

Breach charges do not damage enemies except via shockwaves.

Their purpose is environmental interaction:

- break dungeon walls
- destroy barricades
- open sealed chambers
- trigger scripted event barriers

Breach charges cannot:

- be used in PvP
- be used in open-world grief scenarios
- break anything outside allowed structures

Classic WoW-style safety.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.10 SELF-DAMAGE FORMULA (SAPPER/FAILURE)

Self-damage = 40–70% of bomb damage depending on charge tier and misfire level.

Demolitionist reduces this by 10%.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.11 SAFETY RULESET: HARD LAWS

Engineering cannot:

- create firearm enhancements that violate class identity
- produce explosives larger than sapper charges
- create unlimited-use tools
- mass-produce powder cheaply
- bypass cooldown rules
- circumvent trap arming time
- remove failure chances entirely

This preserves Classic pacing.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 7 — ECONOMIC ROLE, MARKET VALUE, PROFESSION SYNERGIES & SERVER LIFETIME IMPACT

────────────────────────────────────────

Engineering is one of the most economically disruptive professions in Emberwild — not because it directly generates gold, but because it controls access to tools that every hunter, dungeon team, and explorer eventually relies on.

Below is the full economic chapter, structured in the same depth as Enchanting’s Section 6–9.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.0 ECONOMIC ROLE OVERVIEW

Engineering serves four economic purposes:

1. Consumable Supply
    
    Bombs, traps, and devices must be restocked constantly.
    
    Engineering is the primary sink for:
    
    - metals
    - powders
    - oils
    - chemicals
    - rare alloys
    - springs/gears
2. Travel & Utility Access
    
    Engineering tools reduce:
    
    - travel time
    - dungeon risk
    - environmental penalties
    
    Every tool costs money to produce.
    
3. Dungeon/Guild Infrastructure
    
    Sapper charges, breach tools, and field kits are near-mandatory for:
    
    - secret walls
    - collapsible tunnels
    - barricaded chambers
    - buried chests
    - Spirit Realm mechanical interfaces
4. Server-Wide Material Flow
    
    Engineering indirectly boosts every other profession because the components require:
    
    - Mining (ores → plates → alloys)
    - Alchemy (oils, solvents, blasting gel)
    - Woodworking (shafts, casings, braces)
    - Leatherworking (straps, harness)
    - Enchanting (rare ritual optics & lenses)

Engineering is the largest cross-profession material consumer in the entire game.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.1 GOLD FLOW MODEL — ENGINEERING’S TRUE VALUE

Engineering’s impact is NOT from selling bombs directly.

It comes from controlling gateway functions.

Examples:

### 7.1.1 Access Items

Only engineers can craft:

- breaching tools
- mechanical lenses
- auto-hammers
- insulated picks
- powder testers
- safety visors

These items are required for optional dungeon mechanics.

Guilds pay engineers heavily for these.

### 7.1.2 Recurring Consumables

Unlike Enchanting (permanent), Engineering is entirely consumable-based.

One dungeon session typically consumes:

- 3–6 traps
- 1–3 sapper charges
- 2–6 bombs
- 1–2 devices (flares, scanners, etc.)

This makes Engineering a perpetual gold sink, especially in mid-to-late game.

### 7.1.3 Specialty Devices

High-value:

- Mechanical crossbow tuner
- Spirit-pressure calibrator
- Powder-stabilizer kit
- Fog-cutter lantern

These are profitable because they require rare alloys and Solvent IV.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.2 MATERIAL ECONOMY — HOW ENGINEERING SHAPES THE WORLD

Engineering consumes more raw materials than any other profession.

Below is the exact breakdown.

### 7.2.1 Metal Consumption (High)

Engineering drives:

- copper demand (low-tier bombs)
- iron demand (springs/gears)
- steel demand (trap frames)
- rare alloy demand (Artisan devices)

### 7.2.2 Chemical Consumption (Very High)

Alchemy receives enormous demand for:

- Flame Oils
- Volatile Gels
- Stabilizing Agents
- Pressure Solvents

Chemical components have the highest per-unit profit on the server.

### 7.2.3 Powder & Fuel Economy

Black powder and accelerants become one of the most heavily traded commodities.

Miners → refiners → engineers → dungeons.

### 7.2.4 Wood & Leather Subcomponents

- wooden casings
- shafts
- trap braces
- leather straps
- fireproof wrappings

Engineering keeps woodworking & leatherworking relevant.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.3 PROFESSION SYNERGY TABLE (FULL)

| Paired Profession | Synergy Strength | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mining | ★★★★★ | Mandatory: ore → plates → alloys |
| Alchemy | ★★★★★ | Oils, solvents, blasting gel; massive demand |
| Woodworking | ★★★★☆ | Casings, braces, trap frames |
| Leatherworking | ★★★★☆ | Straps, harness, insulation |
| Enchanting | ★★★☆☆ | Optics, lenses, conductive surfaces |
| Skinning | ★★★☆☆ | Leather insulation & padding |
| Cooking | ★★☆☆☆ | Minimal synergy; minor chemical overlaps |
| Fishing | ★☆☆☆☆ | Niche explosives (fishing charges) |

Mining + Alchemy + Engineering is the strongest trio in Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.4 SERVER-LIFETIME IMPACT

Classic-era Engineering maintains relevance from Level 1 to the final patch.

### 7.4.1 Early Game (1–30)

- bombs extremely valuable
- crude tools change leveling pace
- traps boost solo survivability

### 7.4.2 Mid Game (30–50)

- dungeon teams actively seek engineers
- market demand spikes sharply
- breach charges open optional chambers
- mechanical devices begin shaping meta

### 7.4.3 Late Game (50–60)

Engineering becomes:

- essential for dungeon navigations
- best gold-per-hour profession (tool sales)
- primary source of economic sinks

### 7.4.4 Post-Launch Patches

Engineering naturally expands via:

- new rare devices
- new trap schematics
- new dungeon interactions
- new alloys & powders

Engineering scales with world patches unlike fixed professions.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.5 ENGINEERING’S ROLE IN SOCIAL & GROUP PLAY

Engineering fuels group cooperation.

### 7.5.1 Utility Role in Dungeons

Engineers provide:

- breach access
- rescue tools
- mechanical flares
- attractor beacons
- emergency detonators
- fog-clearing lanterns

### 7.5.2 Guild Infrastructure

Large guilds maintain:

- communal engineering storage
- raid-prep kits
- device racks
- charge stockpiles

The profession creates interdependency, the heart of Classic design.

### 7.5.3 Player Reputation

Good engineers become known for:

- reliability
- safety
- knowledge of optional routes
- efficient bomb usage

Engineering is a social prestige profession.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.6 LONG-TERM BALANCE RULES

Engineering must never overshadow:

- pure DPS
- healing
- tanking
- class identity abilities

Thus, bombs:

- never outscale real DPS abilities
- require cooldowns
- require components
- require safety checks

Traps:

- provide CC, not hard locks
- respect boss immunities
- follow arming rules

Devices:

- provide utility, not raw power
- solve problems, not replace classes

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.7 DESIGN INTENT SUMMARY

Engineering is built to be:

- dangerous
- expensive
- deep
- slow
- powerful but fair
- incredibly immersive
- the most utility-focused profession

Not a DPS replacement.

Not a magic profession.

Not a goofy gadget system.

Engineering is grounded, physical, mechanical, Classic.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 8 — TRAINING PROGRESSION (1–300), TIER UNLOCKS, REAGENT SOURCES, TRAINER LOCATIONS & SPECIAL SCHEMATIC DISTRIBUTION
