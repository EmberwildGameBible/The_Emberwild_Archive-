# CHAPTER 31 — WOODWORKING

---

### SECTION 1 — PROFESSION OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

────────────────────────────────────────

Woodworking in Emberwild is a grounded, Classic-era crafting profession focused on the shaping, curing, carving, and reinforcing of natural materials — primarily wood, resin, bark, sinew, and leather bindings.

It sits between pure Classic Woodcraft (bows, arrows, shields) and the more expansive Emberwild survival utility (camp structures, trap frames, staves), without ever drifting into engineering or magical technology.

This chapter defines the full identity, purpose, and tone of Woodworking.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.1 PROFESSION FANTASY — THE MAKERS OF THE WILD

Woodworkers are the quiet backbone of Emberwild’s frontier culture:

- they craft the bows hunters rely on
- they carve the staves priests and witches use in rituals
- they reinforce trap frames for explorers and engineers
- they build simple structures used in camps, hunts, and long treks

Woodworking is defined by:

### Patience

Drying, curing, and shaping take time.

### Craftsmanship

Simple items, but deeply meaningful.

### Survival Utility

A Woodworker’s creations help you survive the world.

### Realism

No magical staves, no druidic fantasy.

Just grounded, physical craft.

### World Integration

Everything crafted by Woodworkers appears throughout the world — in hunter lodges, campfire outposts, ritual sites, siege barricades, and creature dens.

Visually, Woodworking is:

- raw timber
- resin
- rope bindings
- animal sinew
- chiseled grips
- bowed limbs
- rugged leather wraps

A gritty, frontier profession with purpose.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.2 ROLE WITHIN THE WORLD

Woodworking fulfills four main roles in Emberwild:

## A. Weapon Crafting (Classic Core)

- bows
- crossbows
- staves
- spear shafts
- arrows & bolts
    
    These define the profession’s Classic roots.
    

## B. Survival Tools & Camp Gear

- tripods
- drying racks
- camp stakes
- simple barriers
- lantern housings
- wooden braces

Nothing modern — all grounded, wilderness equipment.

## C. Trap Frames & Structural Supports

Supports Engineering, Hunter, and Warden roles:

- basic trap frames
- reinforced trap casings
- wooden pressure bracers
- snares and stake sets
- frame housings for engineering devices

This creates strong cross-profession synergy.

## D. Ritual Implements (Light, Grounded Utility)

NOT magical items — just physical pieces used by other professions:

- priest prayer staves
- witch effigy sticks
- warden totems
- shamanic poles (if added later)
- carved focus rods

These aren’t enchanted — they are merely craftable items used in rituals, not sources of magic.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.3 THEMATIC PILLARS

Woodworking is built on six pillars:

### Craft Over Power

No high-tech devices, no magical output.

### Natural Material Mastery

Wood, resin, rope, leather, bark, bone, sinew.

### Frontier Survival

Items needed to live off the land.

### Simplicity → Mastery

Starts with crude arrows, ends with master bows.

### Cross-Profession Integration

Feeds:

- Engineering
- Enchanting
- Hunting
- Priest/Witch ritual cycles

### Geography Matters

Different woods = different stats.

Forester trees → flexible bowwood.

Highland trees → dense staff cores.

Duner wood → dry & brittle, but lightweight.

Swamper wood → thick & resistant.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.4 PLAYSTYLE OF THE PROFESSION

Woodworking is a gather → cure → craft profession with slow pacing.

### Low Level (1–75)

- crude shafts
- simple bow limbs
- wooden stakes
- basic arrows
- lantern housings

Players feel like apprentice fletchers.

### Mid Level (75–150)

- reinforced bow limbs
- simple traps
- wooden shields
- crossbow stocks
- mid-tier camp structures

This is where Woodworking helps every class.

### High Tier (150–225)

- elite arrows (broadhead, barbed)
- crossbow limbs
- sturdy staff cores
- heavy shields
- engineered frame supports

Demand spikes due to dungeons.

### Artisan Tier (225–300)

- master bows
- carved ritual staves
- precision bolts
- reinforced engineering casings
- aesthetic totems & poles

High-value items become player-famous.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.5 COMPARATIVE VALUE ACROSS LEVELS

Woodworking’s value curve mirrors survival progression:

| Level Range | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–20 | Low | Basic arrows & crude gear |
| 20–40 | Medium | Players need traps, shields, better bows |
| 40–60 | High | Dungeons require reliable ranged weapons |
| 60+ | Very High | Master bows, elite bolts, ritual staves |

Woodworking is one of the best professions for steady, server-long economic value.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.6 CLASS INTERACTIONS & ROLE SYNERGY

Woodworking naturally supports many classes:

### Direct Synergy

- Hunter → bows, arrows, crossbows
- Sand Strider → bows, spear shafts
- Warden → totems & staves
- Priest → carved staff handles
- Witch → effigy staves
- Highlander → wooden tower shields
- Frost Guard → hardened shield cores
- Farmer → camp structures & field tools

### Indirect Synergy

- Engineering → wooden casings, trap frames
- Enchanting → wooden rods & ritual items

### Minimal Synergy

- Seaborn → some weapons
- Animal Tamer → only minor support items

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.7 SOCIAL ROLE

Woodworkers support the world’s physical culture:

- hunters rely on them
- dungeons are easier with good bolts/arrows
- priests & witches use their staves
- engineers need their frames
- camps rely on their structures

They gain good reputation on servers by producing:

- master bows
- ritual staves
- heavy-duty shields
- quality arrows

Woodworking is a quiet prestige craft.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 1.8 IDENTITY SUMMARY

Woodworking is:

- grounded
- practical
- survival-based
- interconnected
- slow and patient
- naturally powerful without breaking class identity
- essential for ranged combat and wilderness travel

It sits beautifully between Classic Woodcrafting and Emberwild utility, without ever slipping into engineering or magic.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 2 — MATERIAL SYSTEM, TOOLS & CURING PROCESS

────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines the full Classic-style material ecosystem for Woodworking, including wood types, binding materials, curing rules, tools, stations, and the profession’s internal logic.

Everything here is crafted to match your low-fantasy, grounded world and to perfectly sync with Enchanting, Engineering, Hunter, Priest, Witch, Highlander, Farmer, and Warden class systems.

No modern shortcuts.

No magical processes.

Only raw craft, patience, time, and frontier skill.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.0 MATERIAL ECONOMY OVERVIEW

Woodworking uses four primary material tiers:

1. Woods — the core crafting resource
2. Resins & Oils — used for curing, binding, and reinforcement
3. Bindings — rope, sinew, leather for structural strength
4. Metal Components (light) — used sparingly for reinforcement

Everything in Woodworking is physical, tangible, and grounded.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.1 WOOD TYPES — CLASSIC & REGION-BASED

Different regions yield unique woods with different stats and crafting roles.

This matches your biome/heritage system exactly.

Below are the official wood categories for Emberwild.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1.1 FORESTER WOODS (Flexible Bowwoods)

### Greenbark Wood

- Very flexible
- Best for novice bows
- Soft, good for carving

### Stagpine Wood

- Durable and springy
- Ideal for mid-tier bows & crossbow limbs

### Ironroot Timber

- Dense, slightly heavy
- Used for heavy staves, shields

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1.2 MOUNTAIN / HIGHLAND WOODS (Dense & Hard)

### Stonebirch

- Extremely dense
- Perfect for staff cores & tower shields

### Frostpine

- Slightly brittle but cold-resistant
- Good for rune-carved staves and lantern housings

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1.3 PLAINSFOLK WOODS (Balanced Utility)

### Windwillow

- Lightweight
- Used for arrows & bolts

### Longreed Timber

- Straight, uniform grain
- Used for spear shafts, trap frames

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1.4 SWAMPER WOODS (Thick & Water-Resistant)

### Marsh Oak

- Slow-growing, thick
- Best for shields & heavy traps

### Bog Cypress

- Naturally water-resistant
- Good for lantern casings and camp structures

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1.5 DUNER WOODS (Dry, Brittle, Lightweight)

### Suncured Driftwood

- Very light
- Excellent for travel gear, stakes

### Dune Ashwood

- Brittle but sharp
- Used for barbed arrowheads & barbed stakes

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1.6 SEABORN COASTAL WOODS (Salt-treated)

### Saltbark Timber

- Naturally hardened by ocean winds
- Good for spear shafts & staves

### Shorepine

- Flexible with a slight curvature
- Niche use in curved bow limbs

────────────────────────────────────────

These woods create a regional crafting economy:

Hunters seek Forester woods; Priests seek Highland woods; Engineers seek Plainsfolk woods, etc.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.2 RESINS & OILS — THE HEART OF CURING

Curing is what transforms fresh-cut wood into usable craft material.

### Tree Resins

- used to waterproof, stiffen, or strengthen wood
- gathered from wild trees or bought in towns

### Curing Oils

- slow-dry oils used to harden wood
- needed for bows, staves, and trap frames

### Binding Oils

- used to wrap rope/sinew tightly
- improves grip and durability

### High-Grade Resin Blocks (Artisan)

- used for master bows & staves
- rare and expensive

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.3 BINDINGS — STRUCTURAL SUPPORT MATERIALS

Wooden items need binding to reinforce stress points.

### Rope Bindings

- used in bows, staves, traps
- basic structural role

### Sinew Bindings

- high-tension, high-strength
- best for bowstrings and reinforced traps

### Leather Wraps

- used for grips, handles, staff sections
- improves grip quality

### Metal Fixtures (Very Limited Use)

Small components only:

- rivets
- caps
- hinge pins
- reinforcing plates

Woodworking does not become metal-based or engineering-adjacent.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.4 SPECIAL WOOD COMPONENTS

Advanced Woodworkers use refined materials:

### Cured Bow Limbs

Pre-shaped, tension-tested limbs for high-quality bows.

### Staff Cores

Solid, dense rods used for Priest, Witch, and Warden staffs.

### Reinforced Trap Frames

Wood + resin + metal pin hybrids.

### Crossbow Stocks

Precision-carved structural bases for Engineer or Hunter crossbows.

### Totem Blocks

Carved wooden cores for ritual totems (non-magical, only structural).

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.5 WOOD-CURING PROCESS

Curing is the most defining system of Woodworking.

It enforces slow progression, Classic pacing, and real-world logic.

## 2.5.1 Step 1 — Cutting / Gathering

Player collects:

- raw logs
- branches
- straight-cut shafts
- bark slabs

## 2.5.2 Step 2 — Rough Shaping

At a Woodworker’s Table:

- remove knots
- shape basic forms
- shave limbs
- create shaft blanks

## 2.5.3 Step 3 — Drying / Curing (Time-Gated)

Curing is required:

- basic wood cures instantly
- advanced materials require 1–6 hours
- master-grade materials require real-time curing (6–24 hours)

Curing never stops progression — it runs in the background like Classic cooldowns.

## 2.5.4 Step 4 — Finishing

Final steps include:

- resin-coating
- oil polishing
- adding bindings
- carving grips
- straightness inspection

## 2.5.5 Step 5 — Reinforcement (Optional)

Higher-tier items can be reinforced with:

- better bindings
- resin plates
- light metal fixtures

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.6 REQUIRED TOOLS — CLASSIC WOODWORKER KIT

Woodworkers use five primary tools:

### 2.6.1 Drawknife

Used to strip bark and shape limbs.

### 2.6.2 Plane & Shaver

Used to flatten, smooth, and square surfaces.

### 2.6.3 Hand Saw

Used to cut shafts, carve blanks, shape casings.

### 2.6.4 Chisel Set

Used for grips, curves, and decorative/ritual carvings.

### 2.6.5 Curing Rack

A placeable tool that dries wood over time.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 2.7 CRAFTING STATIONS

Woodworkers require three tiers of workstations:

### 2.7.1 Basic Woodworking Table (Apprentice 1–75)

### SECTION 5 — SCRAP RECOVERY, MATERIAL BREAKDOWN & WOOD REUSE SYSTEM

────────────────────────────────────────

Woodworking uses a Classic-style salvage loop, similar to Disenchanting but entirely physical, grounded, and realistic — no magic.

This system exists to:

- keep wood types valuable
- prevent infinite materials
- maintain scarcity
- reinforce exploration & gathering
- support Engineering & Hunting economies

This is the exact breakdown system used by the game engine.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.0 OVERVIEW — WHAT “WOOD RECOVERY” IS

Wood Recovery is the Woodworker’s skill that allows breaking down:

- old bows
- broken shields
- trap frames
- spear shafts
- staves
- camp gear
- abandoned casings

into reusable wood scraps, resins, and bindings.

This replaces the “disenchanting” concept for Woodworking while staying fully grounded.

Wood Recovery does NOT return full materials.

It yields:

- scraps (low-tier pieces)
- chips (mid-tier fragments)
- reusable bindings (rare)
- small amounts of resin (rare)

Woodworkers must still gather real wood from the world — recovery is supplemental, not a replacement.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.1 WHAT CAN BE SALVAGED

Allowed items:

### 5.1.1 Bows & Crossbows

- returns shafts, chips
- returns resin fragments (rare)
- may return cords/sinew

### 5.1.2 Shields

- returns planks (low quality)
- returns bindings (rare)

### 5.1.3 Staves

- returns core chips
- returns carved fragments (cosmetic salvage value)

### 5.1.4 Spears & Ammunition

- yields shaft scraps
- sometimes returns fletching (very rare)

### 5.1.5 Trap Frames

- always salvageable
- return beams & resin bits
- high scrap yield

### 5.1.6 Camp Gear

- stakes
- frames
- tripod pieces
- pack frame supports
    
    All salvageable for low-tier scrap.
    

### 5.1.7 Engineering Casings

Only the wooden shell is recoverable.

Metal components require Engineering.

---

Forbidden salvage:

- ultra-rare furniture
- heritage-class items
- ritual artifacts
- spirit-attuned items
    
    These must remain scarce and non-recyclable.
    

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.2 MATERIAL YIELD TABLES (CLASSIC LOGIC)

All salvaging follows predictable Classic-style yields.

### 5.2.1 LOW-TIER ITEMS (Apprentice 1–75)

Yield:

- 1–2 × Wood Scraps
- 0–1 × Rope Fiber
- 0–1 × Basic Resin Flake

### 5.2.2 MID-TIER ITEMS (Journeyman 75–150)

Yield:

- 2–3 × Wood Scraps
- 1 × Wood Chips
- 0–1 × Sinew Piece
- 0–1 × Resin Flake

### 5.2.3 HIGH-TIER ITEMS (Expert 150–225)

Yield:

- 2–4 × Wood Chips
- 1 × Reinforced Scrap
- 0–1 × Binding Cord
- 0–1 × Resin Fragment

### 5.2.4 ELITE ITEMS (Artisan 225–300)

Yield:

- 2–4 × Reinforced Scrap
- 1–2 × Elder Chips
- 1 × Binding Cord (rare)
- 1 × Resin Fragment (rare)

Elite & Artisan materials are never fully returned — they always degrade.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.3 WOOD RECOVERY SKILL REQUIREMENTS

To salvage items, Woodworkers must meet minimum skill thresholds:

Item Tier → Required Woodworking Skill

- 1–15: Skill 1
- 16–35: Skill 25
- 36–55: Skill 90
- 56–75: Skill 150
- 76–95: Skill 200
- 96–120: Skill 250

If skill is too low:

- salvage fails
- item destroyed
- you gain no materials

Classic-style punishment.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.4 SALVAGE LOCATIONS & STATIONS

Salvaging can be done in:

### 5.4.1 Camps (basic salvage)

- small scrap only
- cannot process cured items
- cannot recover resin

### 5.4.2 Town Workshops (Journeyman+)

- can safely break reinforced items
- can extract resin flakes

### 5.4.3 Woodworker’s Guild Halls (Expert+)

- required for Ironroot, Stonebirch, Elderwood salvage
- specialized saws & clamps
- allows binding cord recovery

### 5.4.4 Special Spirit-Realm Salvage Sites

Only for:

- Elderwood
- spirit-attuned ritual staves
- rare totem salvage
    
    Grants:
    
- +1 Elder Chip bonus
- small chance of “Spirit-Leaf Shaving” (used in cosmetic gear)

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.5 SCRAP TIERS (THE MATERIAL PYRAMID)

Woodworking uses four salvage tiers:

### TIER 1 — WOOD SCRAPS

From Apprentice items.

Used for:

- simple bows
- arrows
- basic traps
- camp gear

### TIER 2 — WOOD CHIPS

From Journeyman/Expert items.

Used for:

- reinforced shafts
- improved frames
- shield panels

### TIER 3 — REINFORCED SCRAP

From Expert/Artisan items.

Used for:

- Ironroot-tier crafts
- structural pieces
- crossbow stocks

### TIER 4 — ELDER CHIPS

From top-tier items.

Used for:

- Elderwood repairs
- Masterwork bows/staves
- Elite trap housings

These scraps are valuable, forming Woodworking’s “dust/essence/shard” equivalent.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.6 FAIL STATES & RISK DESIGN

Woodworking has three types of salvage failure:

### Fail Type A — Material Damage

Occurs when salvaging too early or too late.

Loses 1–2 scraps.

### Fail Type B — Binding Failure

Occurs with mid-tier items.

Binding is destroyed.

### Fail Type C — Full Collapse

Occurs with elite items if not high-skill.

You lose the entire item.

This keeps Artisan materials meaningful and scarce.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 5.7 WHY SCRAP RECOVERY MATTERS

Wood Recovery is critical because it:

- keeps low-level wood relevant
- supports Engineering needs
- fuels arrow/bolt economies
- prevents scrap inflation
- creates a proper Classic feedback loop

It reinforces Classic pacing:

Collect → Craft → Use → Salvage → Recraft → Progress

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 6 — ECONOMIC ROLE, MARKET LOOPS & SERVER-LIFETIME VALUE

────────────────────────────────────────

Woodworking is designed as a Classic-era artisan profession with long-term economic impact, slow progression, and persistent demand, without ever overshadowing Engineering or Enchanting.

It fills the structural craft niche in Emberwild’s economy — the craft that creates frames, shafts, stocks, panels, and survival gear used by multiple professions.

This section defines its economic role from level 1 to server maturity.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 ECONOMIC MISSION OF WOODWORKING

Woodworking acts as:

1. A structural craft profession
    - creates bow limbs, spear shafts, crossbow stocks, trap frames
2. A gathering support profession
    - camp structures, markers, and posts used during hunts
3. An Engineering supply profession
    - wooden casings, housings, frames
4. A survival profession
    - tents, racks, lantern housings
5. A steady-material economy
    - keeps wood types relevant at all tiers

It is not a flash profession — it is a backbone craft.

Players feel its presence everywhere in the world.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 GOLD SINK STRUCTURE

Woodworking drains gold naturally through:

### 6.1.1 Varnishes, Oils & Resins

Used constantly for:

- bows
- crossbows
- shields
- trap housings
- staff cores
- camp gear

These act like Enchanting inks:

small, steady, unavoidable sources of gold drainage.

### 6.1.2 Tool Wear & Repair

Planes, saws, clamps, shapers, and chisels degrade.

Replacing these tools creates a Classic-style economy:

- no automation
- no infinite durability
- tools matter
- repairs are a gold flow

### 6.1.3 Crafting Stations

High-tier woodworking uses:

- large saw benches
- reinforced clamps
- drying racks
- resin heaters

Each tier costs progressively more, mirroring Engineering stations.

### 6.1.4 Resin Refinement (Late Game)

Curing Elderwood/Stonebirch requires:

- expensive oils
- rare reagents
- high-tier campfires

This is the gold sink equivalent of Enchanting’s rods.

Woodworking becomes very expensive in the Artisan range.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 MATERIAL-CIRCUIT ECONOMY

Woodworking maintains a closed-loop Classic economy:

Gathering → Crafting → Usage → Salvage → Recrafting → Economy Circulation

Because wood items break, degrade, or get replaced:

- players are ALWAYS buying new bows, shafts, arrows, traps
- scrapped items feed back into early-tier materials
- Woodworkers stay relevant all patch cycle
- wood scarcity stays controlled
- cross-profession synergy grows the economy organically

This prevents resource inflation and ensures wood never becomes worthless.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 MATERIAL DEMAND CURVE (REALISTIC CLASSIC)

Different wood tiers spike in value at different stages of the server:

### LOW TIER WOODS (Softwood, Pine, Alder)

Demand:

- constant, early leveling
    
    Used for:
    
- arrows
- camp gear
- apprentice bows
    
    Never loses value because arrows & traps remain consumable.
    

### MID TIER WOODS (Ironroot, Oak, Birch)

Demand:

- skyrockets during leveling
    
    Used for:
    
- crossbow stocks
- shields
- reinforced traps
- Journeyman items
    
    This market stabilizes but never collapses.
    

### HIGH TIER WOODS (Stonebirch, Black Alder)

Demand:

- tied to dungeon progression
    
    Used for:
    
- high-tension bow limbs
- elite spears
- lightweight staves

Highly profitable, always scarce.

### ELITE WOODS (Elderwood)

Demand:

- tightly bound to top-tier crafting
    
    Used for:
    
- endgame bows
- masterwork staves
- elite totems

The Elderwood market behaves like shards/crystals in Enchanting:

- extremely rare
- very stable
- infinite prestige value

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.4 SERVER-LIFETIME VALUE

Woodworking remains valuable throughout the server’s entire lifespan because:

- bows break
- shields wear down
- arrows are infinite demand
- traps always get used
- Engineering needs wooden casings
- Priest/Witch need ritual staves
- tents/tripods/structures ALWAYS break

And:

- Elderwood items require regular recrafting
- players reroll alts and need new gear
- dungeons always demand consumables

Woodworking will never become obsolete.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.5 PLAYER-TO-PLAYER MARKET LOOPS

Woodworking fuels multiple Classic-style social loops:

### 6.5.1 Hunter Loop

Hunters always need:

- arrows
- bolts
- traps
- bow repairs

This creates constant market movement.

### 6.5.2 Dungeon Loop

Groups purchase:

- reinforced traps
- stockpiles of arrows
- spare shield panels
- upgraded staves for Witches/Priests

Dungeon nights ALWAYS create demand.

### 6.5.3 Camp Utility Loop

Raid groups and Hunt groups need:

- tripods
- racks
- lantern housings
- drying frames

These items degrade → infinite demand cycle.

### 6.5.4 Engineering Loop

Engineering relies on:

- wooden housings
- stocks
- frames
- casings
- handles

This synergy is intentional and deep, similar to WoW’s enchanting + tailoring synergy.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.6 FACTION & REPUTATION ECONOMICS

Certain woodworking recipes and materials require:

- faction standings
- guild-level access
- regional trust
- rare vendors
- Hunt mastery tokens

This creates long-term collectible value.

Some regional woods may ONLY be harvested by trusted players.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.7 HOW WOODWORKING INTERACTS WITH OTHER PROFESSIONS

### Enchanting

- staves
- totems
- off-hand wooden items
- ritual frames

### Engineering

- casings
- trap frames
- structural components

### Alchemy / Herbalism

- adhesives
- varnishes
- resin solvents

### Hunting / Leatherworking

- bowstrings from sinew
- fletching
- grip wrappings

### Mining

- metal reinforcements for crossbows & shields

### Tailoring

- tent cloth
- camp fabrics

This broad network makes Woodworking the “middle spine” of the world economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT

Woodworking:

- stabilizes early game
- supports dungeon progression
- enables engineering
- reinforces the hunter meta
- creates slow-burn, multi-profession trade
- forms a real Classic economy
- provides permanent inflation control
- keeps resource gathering relevant
- provides consistent demand for every wood tier

It is the structural craft profession that holds the server’s economy together.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 7 — PROFESSION QUESTLINE: “THE WOODWRIGHT’S PATH”

────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 8 — LIMITATIONS, SAFETY RULES & POWER-CAP SYSTEMS

────────────────────────────────────────

Woodworking, like all Emberwild professions, must obey strict Classic-era design laws to prevent:

- power creep
- class identity violations
- item inflation
- economic destabilization
- worldbuilding contradictions
- engineering overlap
- infinite resource loops

This section defines the hard rules Woodworking can never break — the same structural philosophy used for Enchanting, Engineering, Cooking, and all class systems.

These rules are permanent.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.0 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Woodworking is governed by three global design laws:

### LAW 1 — Classic Realism Before Everything

Woodworking must remain:

- grounded
- physical
- non-magical
- believable
- labor-intensive

NO:

- magical wood conjuring
- infinite durability
- automated crafting
- goofy or cartoon tools

### LAW 2 — Craft Does Not Replace Class Identity

Woodworking cannot grant power that belongs to classes:

- no bonus accuracy
- no bonus crit chance
- no passive DPS buffs
- no dodge/block increases
- no class-defining effects

Woodworking supports — it does NOT redefine classes.

### LAW 3 — Scarcity Must Remain Scarce

High-tier woods (Stonebirch, Elderwood) must always remain rare.

NO:

- mass-gathering
- multi-node respawns
- salvage loops that give back full materials
- shortcuts around Elite/Artisan scarcity

Scarcity is the backbone of Classic economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.1 CRAFTING LIMITATIONS

### 8.1.1 No Magical Properties

Woodworking cannot:

- imbue magical stats
- create enchanted gear
- add resistances
- add spell power
- add hit/crit

All magical buffs belong to Enchanting.

### 8.1.2 No Mechanical Devices (Engineering Territory)

Woodworking cannot:

- build machines
- create pistons
- assemble gear-driven items
- craft explosive frames
- build traps that “auto-trigger”

Woodworking handles frames only — not mechanisms.

### 8.1.3 No Armor / Weapon Power Inflation

Woodcrafted weapons:

- cannot exceed class baseline damage
- cannot surpass Classic weapon scaling
- cannot break DPS balance

NO power creep.

### 8.1.4 Item Type Restrictions

Woodworking CANNOT craft:

- armor above light shield tier
- staves with magical bonuses
- relics or class artifacts
- bows with elemental effects
- tools that alter class cooldowns or stamina/focus

Everything is grounded.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.2 MATERIAL ACCESS LIMITATIONS

### 8.2.1 High-Tier Woods Require High Skills

Players CANNOT harvest:

- Stonebirch <150
- Black Alder <175
- Elderwood <225

Skill gating is mandatory.

### 8.2.2 Elderwood Cannot Be Mass-Harvested

Elderwood nodes:

- spawn extremely rarely
- often appear in Spirit Realm
- require the Artisan questline
- yield minimal usable wood

Elderwood is your profession’s “crystal.”

### 8.2.3 Scrap Recovery Never Returns Full Value

Salvage is partial only.

- No full refund
- No infinite recycling
- No material duplication

Wood scarcity must remain real.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.3 CRAFTING POWER CAPS

Weapons:

- bows/crossbows must stay balanced within your combat pacing
- no %damage or crit bonuses
- no hidden accuracy bonuses

Shields:

- must NOT exceed Classic-tier values
- armor caps must be respected

Traps:

- no “smart traps”
- no automation
- no magical effects

Camp Utility:

- no stamina regeneration
- no health regen
- no buff-granting furniture

Woodcraft is utility and structure — not buffs.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.4 CLASS IDENTITY PROTECTION RULES

Woodworking CANNOT undermine class traits:

### 8.4.1 No Mobility Effects

- no run speed bonuses
- no jump height changes

Seaborn mobility stays unique.

### 8.4.2 No Defense Alterations

- no block chance
- no dodge chance
- no parry buff

Highlander, Frost Guard, Warden remain tanks.

### 8.4.3 No Pet Enhancements

- no Animal Tamer pet scaling
- no Witch spirits bonuses

### 8.4.4 No Stealth or Detection Tools

- no scouting tools that replace Hunter
- no magical vision tools that replace Witch/Priest

### 8.4.5 No Class Cooldown Modifiers

Crafting cannot manipulate class combat loops.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.5 TOOL & STATION LIMITATIONS

### 8.5.1 Tools Must Degrade

Planes, chisels, clamps, saws:

- must wear down
- must regularly break
- act as long-term gold sinks

### 8.5.2 Stations Should Be Rare & Costly

Higher-tier stations:

- only found in guild halls
- require faction reputation
- cannot be carried
- require maintenance fees

This preserves the Classic economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.6 GATHERING LIMITS & WORLD RULES

### 8.6.1 No Mass Logging

Nodes:

- slow respawn
- small output
- region-specific

### 8.6.2 No Node-Skipping Tools

Players cannot skip:

- sawdust clearing
- bark stripping
- resin curing

Gathering is deliberate.

### 8.6.3 Regional Rarity Must Remain Consistent

Stonebirch is Highlander.

Black Alder is Swamper.

Elderwood is Spirit Realm.

No global node mixing.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.7 ECONOMY SAFETY RULES

### 8.7.1 Wood Prices Must Stay Stable

How:

- slow node respawns
- salvage giving partial returns
- controlled material flow
- heavy tool upkeep
- cross-profession dependency

### 8.7.2 No Vendor Flooding

Vendors DO NOT sell:

- high-tier wood
- resin
- reinforced shafts

Everything must be player-driven.

### 8.7.3 No Catch-up Mechanics

No:

- XP boosts
- crafting reductions
- accelerated leveling

Classic pacing only.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.8 WHY THESE LIMITS MATTER

They ensure Woodworking stays:

- balanced
- immersive
- slow and meaningful
- part of the global economy
- a structural craft, not a combat profession
- distinct from Engineering and Enchanting
- compatible with your class balance

Woodworking becomes a permanent, stable anchor to your world’s realism and scarcity economy.

────────────────────────────────────────

### SECTION 9 — FINAL DESIGN CHECKLIST & END-OF-CHAPTER SUMMARY

────────────────────────────────────────

This section formally locks the entire Woodworking profession into the Emberwild 4.3.5 ruleset.

It follows the same structure you used for all finalized systems (Hunter, Enchanting, Engineering, Priest, Highlander, Frost Guard).

Everything below acts as your developer-facing validation suite, ensuring Woodworking never breaks Classic design, item scarcity, or class identity.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.0 GLOBAL CHECKLIST — THE 30 LAWS OF WOODWORKING

### 9.0.1 Realism & Identity

✔ Woodworking remains fully grounded (no magical or mechanical effects)

✔ No enchanted gear — Enchanting owns magical augmentation

✔ No mechanical devices — Engineering owns mechanisms

✔ Woodworking = structure, survival, craft, economy

---

### 9.0.2 Crafting Restrictions

✔ No %damage, crit, hit, or DPS increases

✔ No stat bonuses outside realism (weight reduction allowed only via materials, not bonuses)

✔ No passive player buffs (movement speed, regen, detection, etc.)

✔ No class ability enhancements

✔ No pet or spirit bonuses

---

### 9.0.3 Material Hierarchy Integrity

✔ Softwood → Ironroot/Oak → Birch/Stonebirch → Elderwood power curve preserved

✔ Elderwood cannot be mass-gathered

✔ Scrap recovery always partial, never full

✔ Resin remains mid-tier bottleneck

✔ No infinite loops or zero-loss crafting

---

### 9.0.4 Salvaging Rules

✔ Low-skill salvage can destroy items

✔ Salvage yields scrap only, not full materials

✔ Reinforced/Elderwood salvage requires proper skill

✔ Spirit-Realm salvage sites are optional but high-value

---

### 9.0.5 Item Type Rules

✔ Woodworking can craft bows, crossbows, staves, shields, traps, shafts, camp structures

✔ Woodworking cannot craft armor beyond shields

✔ Woodworking cannot craft magical tomes or relics

✔ Woodworking cannot craft mechanical traps or devices

---

### 9.0.6 Profession Progression

✔ 1–300 Classic-style tiering

✔ Apprentice → Journeyman → Expert → Artisan

✔ High-tier crafting requires special camps/stations

✔ Tool degradation is mandatory

✔ Resin curing remains slow and expensive

---

### 9.0.7 Questline Requirements

✔ Four-arc Mastery questline implemented

✔ Spirit-Realm attunement required for Elderwood

✔ Masterwork creation required for Artisan rank

✔ Gathering, curing, salvaging, and construction are all tested

---

### 9.0.8 Economic Stability

✔ Tools drain gold over time

✔ Varnish/resin refining act as gold sinks

✔ No high-tier wood is sold by vendors

✔ Wood scarcity remains stable server-wide

✔ Cross-profession synergy stays intact (Engineering, Enchanting, Tailoring, etc.)

---

### 9.0.9 Future-Proofing

✔ No future patch can exceed existing power caps

✔ New woods must fit into the existing scarcity ladder

✔ No auto-crafting or QoL shortcuts added later

✔ No catch-up mechanics that bypass Classic pacing

✔ No duplication of Enchanting/Engineering roles

---

### 9.0.10 Player Progression Integrity

✔ New players always need basic bows, traps, arrows

✔ High-level players always need repairs, replacements

✔ Elderwood items degrade, ensuring perpetual demand

✔ Alts and rerolls keep low-tier wood relevant

✔ Dungeon/meta loops always require woodworking consumables

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.1 ROLE SUMMARY — WHAT WOODWORKING IS IN EMBERWILD

Woodworking is the structural backbone of the world’s physical economy.

It creates:

- bows
- crossbows
- spear shafts
- staves
- traps
- camp structures
- wooden engineering housings
- survival gear
- shield panels
- arrows & bolts
- ritual frames

It is a slow, grounded, Classic-era profession that rewards patience, exploration, gathering, and craftsmanship.

It supports:

- Hunters (weapons, ammo, traps)
- Witches & Priests (ritual staves & frames)
- Engineers (casings & housings)
- Adventuring groups (structures, tents, traps)

Without ever stepping into magic or machines.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.2 CLASS BALANCE INTEGRITY

Woodworking does not change combat role identities:

- Tanks stay tanks
- DPS stay DPS
- Healers stay healers
- Mobility classes stay mobility classes
- Pet classes stay pet classes

Woodcrafted items never violate:

- dodge/block balance
- armor class rules
- hit/crit distribution
- pet scaling
- spirit systems

Everything stays clean and fair.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 9.3 PATCH & FUTURE-PROOF RULES

Any future update must obey:

1. No Woodworking item may raise player stats beyond Classic caps.
2. No new woods may exceed Elderwood in scarcity or power.
3. New recipes must fit into existing tiers (Apprentice → Artisan).
4. No “smart traps” or mechanical assistance features.
5. No automation — crafting always takes time and materials.
6. Woodworking must remain a gold sink forever.
7. No vendor shortcuts for high-tier materials.

# 9.4 END-OF-CHAPTER SUMMARY

Woodworking in Emberwild is:

- grounded
- Classic-inspired
- slow and immersive
- craft-focused
- material-driven
- quest-anchored
- economically essential
- balanced with class identity
- deeply tied to the physical world

It forms the structural craft layer of your world — the profession that builds the real objects adventurers depend on, but without overshadowing magic (Enchanting) or mechanisms (Engineering).

With Woodworking finalized, Emberwild’s profession matrix now includes:

- Cooking
- Enchanting
- Engineering
- Woodworking
    
    (…and more to be added cleanly into Chapters 32–35 as needed)
    

Woodworking is now COMPLETE and fully locked under Patch 1.0 Crafting Rules.
