# CHAPTER 21 — ALCHEMY

“Every remedy is earned — from sweat, soil, and scarcity.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.0 — PURPOSE OF ALCHEMY

Alchemy in Emberwild is a practical survival craft, not a magical one.

It mirrors real-world herbalism, chemistry, and field medicine.

Alchemy produces:

- Poultices (applied to wounds)
- Tonics (drunk to strengthen recovery)
- Draughts (short-term resilience boosts)
- Stimulants (situational burst energy)
- Poisons (coating for weapons)
- Incense (spirit-realm and bonding utility)
- Solvents (for crafting and cleaning)
- Preservatives (food and hide treatment)

Alchemy does not produce:

- magic buffs
- instant heals
- elemental damage potions
- supernatural abilities
- spellcraft

Everything is grounded in the world’s ecology and survival logic.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.1 — ALCHEMY PHILOSOPHY

Alchemy reinforces Emberwild’s tone:

- slow
- deliberate
- meaningful
- realistic
- crafted from the land
- grounded in natural law

There is no mana.

No enchantment.

No mystical spellcraft.

Just real tools for survival.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.2 — ALCHEMY RESOURCE TYPES

Alchemy uses materials gathered from:

- herbs
- mushrooms
- roots
- tree saps
- animal glands
- body oils
- bones
- stones
- rare spirit-realm flora
- insect parts

Each ingredient has:

- Type (root, leaf, oil, resin, etc.)
- Potency (mild → strong)
- Nature (warming, cooling, numbing, stimulating, caustic)
- Toxicity (safe, low, high)
- Rarity (common → rare elite based on region)

No ingredient is magical — only useful.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.3 — ALCHEMY WORKFLOW

Alchemy follows a consistent four-step loop:

### 1. Preparation

Cutting, grinding, drying, and cleaning components.

Some ingredients must be:

- boiled
- macerated
- smoked
- rinsed
- crushed

### 2. Stabilization

Mixing stabilizers:

- alcohol
- vinegar
- animal fat
- clay
- saltwater
- charcoal
- resin

Stabilization determines:

- shelf life
- potency
- toxicity reduction

### 3. Crafting

Actual creation of:

- poultice
- tonic
- draught
- poison
- incense

### 4. Bottling / Binding

Packaging that determines:

- weight
- spoil timer
- application method

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.4 — ALCHEMY CATEGORIES (FINAL)

These are the six official categories of Alchemy.

---

## 1. Poultices (Applied Healing)

Poultices are:

- bandage-like
- ground herbs mixed with fat, resin, or fibers
- applied directly to wounds

Effects include:

- reduce bleeding
- reduce infection chance
- accelerate recovery
- remove swelling
- treat bruises
- treat burns

NOT instant healing.

Recovery is over time, realistic.

---

## 2. Tonics (Passive Recovery Boosts)

Tonics are:

- liquid
- slow-acting
- stamina, focus, or vitality restoration tools

Examples:

- stamina-recovery tonic
- fever-reduction tonic
- nerve-steadying tonic

They NEVER provide “+10% damage.”

They support survival, not power fantasy.

---

## 3. Draughts (Short-Term Physical Resistance)

Draughts are the closest thing to a buff — but still grounded.

Examples:

- cold-resist draught
- heat-resist draught
- pain-dulling draught (temporary stagger resistance)
- morale-steadying draught
- bitterroot fortifier (temporary small bleed resistance)

No magic.

Just natural chemistry.

---

## 4. Stimulants (Burst Tools)

Stimulants provide:

- quick bursts of stamina
- improved reflexes
- brief speed increases
- heightened senses

Risk:

- chance of crash
- increased thirst
- reduced recovery afterwards

Grounded. Human. Dangerous if abused.

---

## 5. Poisons (Weapon Coatings)

All poisons are:

- applied manually
- short-duration
- realistic chemical irritants/toxins

Types:

- Hemotoxin (bleed multiplier)
- Neurotoxin (brief stagger)
- Caustic Oil (armor penetration over time)
- Beast-Rage Agent (causes animals to make mistakes)
- Insect Bile (lowers creature morale briefly)

NO instant death.

NO magical debuffs.

NO fantasy “shadow poison.”

---

## 6. Incense & Ritual Materials

Used for:

- Spirit Sight enhancement
- companion bonding
- calming aggressive animals
- ceremonial events
- Tamer rituals
- clan/heritage traditions

Ingredients include:

- spiritbloom
- duskfeather down
- oldwood chips
- faded bark

These do NOT grant power.

They influence mood, clarity, atmosphere, and behavior, not combat stats.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.5 — ALCHEMY & THE WORLD

Alchemy directly interacts with:

## Weather

- heat → faster drying
- rain → renewable mushrooms
- fog → fungal growth
- snow → slow herb regrowth

## Seasons

- spring → best herb yield
- summer → most insects
- autumn → roots/fungi flourish
- winter → rare, strong reagents exposed by frost

## Zones

Outer → common materials

Inner → rare materials

Heartlands → rare elite materials

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.6 — ALCHEMY & CLASSES

Alchemy benefits EVERY class but synergizes naturally with:

### Hunter

- scent masking
- tracking stimulants
- anti-fatigue tonics

### Tamer

- bonding incense
- companion poultices
- flea/parasite prevention agents
- calming draughts

### Farmer

- preservation oils
- drying agents
- field medic poultices

### Warden

- pain-dulling draughts
- cold resist tonics
- morale restorers

### Highlander / Frost Guard (heavy armor)

- muscle salves
- bruise relievers

No class becomes overpowered.

Alchemy is survival-focused.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.7 — ALCHEMY STATIONS

Alchemy can be done:

- at campfires
- in town alchemist huts
- inside traveling caravan wagons
- at wilderness workbenches

Each station provides:

- better stability times
- safer crafting
- less toxicity risk

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.8 — SKILL PROGRESSION

Alchemy skill increases by:

- crafting
- discovering new ingredients
- successful stabilizations
- safe handling of toxins
- brewing higher-tier tonics

Higher skill unlocks:

- more recipes
- safer handling (lower toxicity)
- improved potency
- reduced spoilage
- more stable stimulants

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.9 — SPOILAGE & QUALITY

Every alchemy product has:

- Quality
- Potency
- Shelf Life

Factors that affect shelf life:

- heat exposure
- quality of stabilization
- container type
- weather
- travel conditions

Higher quality ingredients yield longer-lasting, safer items.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 21.10 — DESIGN INTENT

Alchemy must feel:

- grounded
- human
- realistic
- useful
- risky
- tied to the land
- essential to survival

It must NOT feel:

- magical
- “potion spam”
- MMO buff stacking
- fantasy spellcasting
- Diablo affix-based

Alchemy deepens Emberwild’s:

- exploration
- tracking
- gathering
- survival
- world identity
- class synergy
- realism
