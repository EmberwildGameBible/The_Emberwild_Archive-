# Saltmarrow Tidecaller Grapnel

## Origin/Provenance
Forged from chain salvaged off the wreck of the Red Gull and consecrated in brine by dock chanters. A salt-crusted bounty board clipping lists the grapnel as payment for retrieving a captain lost near the kelp labyrinths.

## Cultural Tie
Saltmarrow crews treat the grapnel as a lucky charm; it is passed from skipper to skipper when a ship earns its first deep-haul contract. The tassels are dyed to match the signals flown along the [Saltmarrow Strand](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Zone_Index.md).

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary tool that anchors boats for long netting runs and grants an emergency pull during kelp storms. Provides a profession bonus for Fishing checks while running [dockside systems loops](../../06_Systems/Docks_and_Sailing.md), keeping nets from tearing.
