# Gatewarden_Fissure_Chart

**Origin/Provenance:** Hastily inked chart mapping fissure surge timing, pried from the Gatewarden’s lectern.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford foremen tack copies in bunkhouses, adding chili smudges where lunch breaks overlap vent calms.

**Gameplay Hook:** Usable document that pre-buffs the party with fissure warning pings and increases shard drop chance on Gatewarden kills; recording it advances [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
