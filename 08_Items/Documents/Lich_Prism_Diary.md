# Lich_Prism_Diary

**Origin/Provenance:** Silvered journal page that only reveals ink when held to reflected light in the Crypt.

**Cultural Tie:** Riverwatch scribes call it the “mirror confession,” using copies to train apprentices in careful reading.

**Gameplay Hook:** Document that teaches stagger timing for mirror adds and grants bonus drop chance on Mirror-Lich when read at a prism node; logs [Shardbound_Challenge_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Shardbound_Challenge_Note.md).
