# Greatwood Charter of Pactbound Rivers

## Origin/Provenance
First inked by riverwardens after the Ragged King revolt and recopied whenever a bridge is rebuilt. A water-stained page survives in the [Greatwood contract pack](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B115%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20Contract%20Pack%20(Phase%20I%E2%80%93II,%20Levels%201%E2%80%939).md), naming the charter as collateral for ferry rights.

## Cultural Tie
The charter is recited at lodge moot nights where ferrymen swap routes and rumors. Scribes mark it with inking styles shared along the [Greatwood river travel notes](../../GameBible/Future/Features/63%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20World%20Map,%20Sub-Regions,%20and%20Points%20of%20Interest.md), making it both law and folklore.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary document that unlocks riverway flight paths and reduces waterway taxes for guilds. Provides a diplomacy bonus during [Greatwood onboarding](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B111%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20Onboarding%20%26%20Player%20Flow%20(1%E2%80%9320).md) when negotiating ferry escorts.
