# Frostbriar Covenant of Shiversteel

## Origin/Provenance
Drafted when Frostbriar guilds first brokered trade across the icebridges. A cracked seal from the [Frostbriar Reach world event](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Frostbriar_Reach_World_Event.md) shows the covenant was ratified after a caravan survived a blizzard siege.

## Cultural Tie
Smithing clans reference the covenant before cutting any shiversteel, and apprentices memorize its clauses alongside forge prayers. Its wording mirrors the tariffs listed in the [Frostbriar settlement brief](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Frostbriar_Reach_Settlements.md), keeping commerce honest.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary accord that authorizes shiversteel trade stamps and reduces forging loss when crafting froststeel gear. Grants negotiation bonuses during [Frostbriar travel events](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Overview.md) where icy toll gates appear.
