# Ventflare_Resin_Tonic

**Origin/Provenance:** Cooling draught brewed from slagfuse resin and chillmoss, issued to Descent runners before fissure pushes.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford medics spike it with pepper mash; Greatwood scouts mix in pine needles for luck.

**Gameplay Hook:** Consumable granting burst fire resistance and stamina regen during vent surges; using it before a Gatewarden pull increases chance at ventbreaker loot and logs to [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
