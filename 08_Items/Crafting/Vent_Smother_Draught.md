# Vent_Smother_Draught

**Origin/Provenance:** Alchemical draught brewed by Glimmerdeep alchemists using glowspore tallow and peat ash pulled from Ashen Cry vents.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak sled captains stash a flask on every bridge run, claiming it tastes like wet rope but keeps lungs clear.

**Gameplay Hook:** Consumable granting short fire resistance and smoke-cleansing ticks; doubles drop chance from Embermouth vents when used during fight. Using it notes [Slidecaller_Field_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Slidecaller_Field_Note.md).
