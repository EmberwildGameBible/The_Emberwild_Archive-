# Briar_Sinew_Binding

**Origin/Provenance:** Twisted sinew cords from Shiverhoof bulls treated with briar sap resin.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak sledders prize the bindings for rail lashings; Marrowhook traders buy them to strap salt crates against surf shocks.

**Gameplay Hook:** Crafting reagent for sled gear and chill-resistant trinkets; required by Frostbriar quests and Ashen Cry upgrades.
