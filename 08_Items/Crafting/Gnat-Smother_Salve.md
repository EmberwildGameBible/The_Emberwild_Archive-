# Gnat-Smother Salve

Thick salve that clogs salt gnat spiracles.

- Origin/Provenance: Mixed by Scribe Dov using resin, tea oil, and gnat ash collected on Windbreak Palisade torches.
- Cultural tie: Watch crews smear it on brows before dusk; a rite proving someone survived the first swarm.
- Gameplay hook: Reduces swarm slow effects during [Windbreak Bounty Board](../../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) patrols.
