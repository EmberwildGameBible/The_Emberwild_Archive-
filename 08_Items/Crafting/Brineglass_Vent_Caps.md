# Brineglass Vent Caps

Rounded glass caps fitted over steam vents.

- Origin/Provenance: Cast from Brineglass shards by Cinderfen tinkers, traded through Marrowhook for vent safety.
- Cultural tie: Worn on cords around the neck as proof of “glass-feet” experience on the flats.
- Gameplay hook: Reduce hazard damage when harvesting near brine vents and required for [Strandline Courier Loop](../../07_Quests/Strandline_Courier_Loop.md) route clearance.
