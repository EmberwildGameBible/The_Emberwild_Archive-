# Saltmarrow Driftchart

## Origin/Provenance
Hand-scribed on oilcloth by ferrymen who rode the last storm season without losing cargo. A shipping ledger line from the [Saltmarrow Strand index](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Zone_Index.md) notes this chart being copied for tidecourt envoys.

## Cultural Tie
Charts like this hang in taverns to mark which crews dared the kelp mazes. The ink symbols mirror signposts recorded in the [Saltmarrow travel overview](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Zone_Overview.md), so locals read it as both map and brag sheet.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic sea chart that marks hidden shoals and shortens ferry cooldowns. Grants Cartography and Navigation bonuses during [dock systems](../../06_Systems/Docks_and_Sailing.md) and improves escort routes for Saltmarrow delivery quests.
