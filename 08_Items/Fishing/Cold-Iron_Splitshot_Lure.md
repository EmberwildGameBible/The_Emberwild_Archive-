# Cold-Iron_Splitshot_Lure

**Origin/Provenance:** Cast from recycled slide bolts coated in salt to resist ice; sold by Scout Grella.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak sledders pinch these onto lines when fishing during rest stops; Marrowhook couriers view them as lucky ballast.

**Gameplay Hook:** Fishing tackle that improves catch rates in icy water and during Slidecaller events; counts toward Frostbriar repeatables.
