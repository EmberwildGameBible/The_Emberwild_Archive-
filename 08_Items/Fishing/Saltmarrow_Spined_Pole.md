# Saltmarrow Spined Pole

A driftwood fishing pole banded with reefback spine plates.

- Origin/Provenance: Crafted by Netwright Joft at Marrowhook using plates gathered in Kelpback Shallows.
- Cultural tie: Carved knotwork marks a crew’s first “ledger walk,” earning permission to fish beyond the palisade.
- Gameplay hook: Grants a small chance to avoid line snaps when pulling reefback-scale fish during [Kelp Sweep](../../07_Quests/Kelp_Sweep.md).
