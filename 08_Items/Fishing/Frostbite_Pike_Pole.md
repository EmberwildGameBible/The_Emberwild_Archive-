# Frostbite_Pike_Pole

**Origin/Provenance:** Crafted by Scout Grella using split ash wood and iron rings to keep line guides from freezing.

**Cultural Tie:** Favored by Frostbriar anglers who fish thaw cracks; Saltmarrow fishers barter kelp rope to copy the design.

**Gameplay Hook:** Mid-tier fishing pole with chill mitigation; increases catch rates for Gleam Eels and ventfish during Glimmerdeep events.
