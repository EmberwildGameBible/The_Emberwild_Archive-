# Glowspore_Tallow_Lure

**Origin/Provenance:** Dipped hooks treated with glowspore tallow by Lantern Barge brokers.

**Cultural Tie:** Pole-walkers gift a tin to newcomers who “pay the gleam”; Saltmarrow fishers use it to see lines at dusk.

**Gameplay Hook:** Fishing lure boosting catches during Gleam Surges and in Ash Vent hollows; required for several Glimmerdeep quests.
