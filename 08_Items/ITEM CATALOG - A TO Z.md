## Notes on Balance & Sources
- **Dungeon vs. Raid:** Blue dungeon pieces target pre-raid gearing; raid epics add procs with cooldowns to avoid burst inflation.
- **PvP Crossover:** PvP gear should trade raw stats for control/escape tools so raid gear doesn’t dominate battlegrounds.
- **Professions:** Crafted gear keeps pace with early raids but is intentionally outscaled by later tiers. Consumables provide small, stackable bonuses—not mandatory raid walls.
