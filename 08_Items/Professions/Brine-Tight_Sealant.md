# Brine-Tight Sealant

Waterproofing paste brewed from kelp wax and saltmarrow ash.

- Origin/Provenance: Rendered in Marrowhook vats using ash scraped from Brineglass Flats.
- Cultural tie: Dock crews smear it over rope charms as proof they “spined up” for reefback season.
- Gameplay hook: Used to reinforce fishing poles and courier bundles, reducing water damage during [Strandline Courier Loop](../../07_Quests/Strandline_Courier_Loop.md).
