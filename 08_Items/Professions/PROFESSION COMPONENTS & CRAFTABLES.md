# Profession Components & Craftables

Expansion-ready reference for classic-style professions. Pair with the ingredient catalog and armory when assigning loot tables or vendor stock.

## Gathering Inputs
- **Herbalism:** Rare petals (Crescent Bloom, Brightspice), resist herbs (Ashleaf, Emberleaf), potion bases (Everfenn Greens, Barkfenn Herb).
- **Mining:** Core ores (Tin, Iron, Mithril), rare gems (Dawnstone, Star Shard) for crafted jewelry and weapon hilts.
- **Skinning:** Thick hides (Direhide, Frostpelt), scales (Stormscale) for tanking drums and resist cloaks.
- **Fishing:** Pearls (Glimmering Pearl), oils (Deepwater Eel Oil), rare bait for quest-only catches.

## Crafted Consumables
- **Potions:** Hit/crit tonics with 2-minute durations; resist draughts tied to specific raid wings; alchemist stones that amplify potion effects but enforce shared cooldowns.
- **Food:** Class-role meals (tank threat stew, healer spirit soup, caster crit tart) built from the ingredient catalog; travel rations and war supply crates for raids.
- **Weapon Oils & Whetstones:** Limited charges, small elemental bonuses, and minor threat/crit boosts; no permanent enchants.

## Crafted Gear
- **Blacksmithing:** Pre-raid plate/mail sets with +hit and threat; weapon hilts requiring rare gems; shield spikes tuned for tanks.
- **Leatherworking:** Faction-themed leather/mail sets; drums with resist or haste-lite effects on long cooldowns; quivers and ammo pouches.
- **Tailoring:** Cloth sets with regen/throughput splits; bag progression (10/14/16-slot) with specialty herb/ore bags.
- **Jewelcrafting:** Rings/necklaces with balanced stat pairs (hit + resist, spirit + mp5). Limited to one “jewelmaster” item equipped to avoid stacking.

## Profession Specializations
- **Armor vs. Weapon Smithing:** Armor smiths craft defensive plates and shields; weapon smiths focus on slow, heavy hitters with controlled procs.
- **Elemental vs. Tribal Leatherworking:** Elemental focuses on resist gear; Tribal delivers class-aligned offensive sets.
- **Spell vs. Battle Tailoring:** Spell tailors lean into +spell power and regen; battle tailors add hybrid stats and short defensive procs.

## Economy & Balance Notes
- Crafted items should bridge gaps, not replace dungeon/raid progression.
- Consumable buffs remain additive and modest; stacking is capped via shared cooldowns and unique equip.
- Rare reagents should come from dungeons/raids to keep professions tied to group play.
