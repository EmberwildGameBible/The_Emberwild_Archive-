# CHAPTER 10 — APPENDIX C — GEAR ENHANCEMENTS & ENCHANTING GEMS

---

Emberwild Enhancement, Enchanting & Gem System

This appendix defines every single enhancement pathway available to players—temporary and permanent—using Classic WoW–style logic, with Emberwild flavor.

This entire system respects:

- Normal / Rare / Elite / Rare Elite / Boss / Ultra-Rare / Mini-Boss
- No affix soup
- No Diablo-style random stat rolling
- No modern gem/slot RNG
- No overpowering custom crafts

Everything is handcrafted, slow, grounded, Classic-style progression.

---

# C.1 PURPOSE OF ENHANCEMENTS

Enhancements exist to:

- provide small but meaningful upgrades
- create a gold and material sink
- reinforce professions
- offer endgame min-maxing
- preserve class identity (no universal stat-stick gems)

Enhancements cannot:

- Replace gear progression
- Break class schemas
- Override stat budgets
- Add weapon families or armor proficiencies
- Act as a substitute for leveling or weapon skill

Enhancements = icing, not the cake.

---

# C.2 ENCHANTMENT TIERS

Enchantments are divided into four tiers, tied directly to enemy and material rarity:

### C2.1 — Minor Enchantments (Tier 1)

- Sourced from: Normal enemies, low-tier materials, common profession nodes.
- Provides very small bonuses, e.g.:
    - +2 Strength
    - +4 Armor
    - +1 Weapon Skill (rare version)
    - +1 Weapon Damage (tiny)

Purpose:

- Smooth early leveling
- Low-cost player economy

### C2.2 — Standard Enchantments (Tier 2)

- Sourced from: Rare and Elite enemies.
- Crafting difficulty moderate.
- Bonuses:
    - +5–8 primary stats
    - +10–20 armor
    - +5 Attack Power
    - +1% movement out of combat
    - +6 Spell/Technique Power for casters

Purpose:

- Core midgame enhancement path.

### C2.3 — Advanced Enchantments (Tier 3)

- Sourced from: Rare Elites, Mini-Bosses, zone-capped bosses, specialized rare materials.
- Stronger bonuses but still Classic-level modest.

Examples:

- +12 Stamina
- +12 Agility
- +14 Attack Power
- +10 Spell Power
- +1% Hit Chance (rare, highly valuable)
- +1% Crit Chance (extremely rare and controlled)
- +20 Armor + 1% Dodge (tank-only variants)

Purpose:

- High-end min-maxing
- Very expensive
- Not mandatory

### C2.4 — Ultra-Rare Enchantments (Tier 4)

- Sourced ONLY from:
    - Ultra-Rare Materials
    - Rare Elite treasure caches
    - Ultra-low global chance drops
    - Zone events and environmental jackpots
    - Rare profession discoveries (extremely low odds)
    - Fishing / Cooking / Exploration jackpots

These enchantments:

- DO NOT scale beyond Classic-level logic
- Provide only ~5–8% stronger bonuses than Tier 3
- Often add unique cosmetic or thematic effects, not raw power.

Examples:

- +2 to ALL Primary Stats
- +18 Stamina (tank version)
- +16 AP + minor glow effect
- +12 Spell Power + unique aura effect
- “Ultra-Rare Tracking Sigil” → very small +1% tracking radius
- “Honed Edge” → +3 weapon skill (extremely rare)

Purpose:

- Ultra-rare chase items
- 1-in-X global drop tracking
- Extremely small boosts, mostly prestige

No gameplay-breaking effects.

# C.3 ENCHANTMENT RULES & RESTRICTIONS

### C3.1 — Enchants Cannot Break Class Identity

An enchant may NOT:

- give a weapon family the class can’t use
- add armor type they cannot equip
- give abilities not meant for the class
- create universal op meta stats

### C3.2 — Slot-Based Limitations

Every slot has 1 permanent enchant slot and 1 temporary enhancement slot:

Permanent Enchants:

- Persist until overwritten
- Costly
- Require crafting + materials

Temporary Enhancements:

- Food, oils, sharpening stones, etc.
- Last 30–60 minutes
- Lost on death if the design requires it
- Cheap and accessible

### C3.3 — No Stacking of Similar Effects

You cannot stack:

- Hit Chance enchants
- +Weapon Skill enchants
- Multiple percent-based defensives
- Multiple movement speed boosts
- Any enhancement that becomes abusable by stacking

Percent-based effects use hard caps.

---

# C.4 GEM SOCKETING SYSTEM (Classic-Style Restrained)

Gems in Emberwild follow Classic philosophy, not retail:

- Very few sockets
- Not present on all items
- Mostly appear on Rare Elite, Mini-Boss, and Boss drops
- Socket bonuses are modest
- No color-matching meta-game
- No RNG sockets

Sockets = handcrafted, rare, meaningful.
