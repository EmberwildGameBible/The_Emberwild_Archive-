# Frostbriar_Stag_Shanks

**Origin/Provenance:** Cut from elk hunted near Shatterpine Outlook and cured over cedar smoke at Timberline Post.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak cooks say the marrow “keeps chill from the fingers”; Marrowhook couriers trade salt for the richer cuts.

**Gameplay Hook:** Cooking ingredient boosting chill resistance meals; required for Timberline nightly stew and some Frostbriar quest turn-ins.
