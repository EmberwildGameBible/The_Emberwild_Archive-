# Gleam_Eel_Filets

**Origin/Provenance:** Filleted from luminous eels caught in Gleam-Cup Pools during surges.

**Cultural Tie:** Mirefolk dry the fillets into rations that glow faintly; Saltmarrow cooks mix them with kelp for night markets.

**Gameplay Hook:** Cooking ingredient that boosts vision in fog; requested by Glimmerdeep quests and rewarded from event caches.
