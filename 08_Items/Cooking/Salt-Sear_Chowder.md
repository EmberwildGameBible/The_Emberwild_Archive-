# Salt-Sear Chowder

Hearty reefback stew finished with seared saltmarrow slabs.

- Origin/Provenance: Cook Bren Olm’s galley recipe served nightly in Marrowhook.
- Cultural tie: Shared at dusk “stray tide” gatherings to chase off bad luck gossip.
- Gameplay hook: Grants cold resistance and improves success of [Kelp Sweep](../../07_Quests/Kelp_Sweep.md) runs for an hour.
