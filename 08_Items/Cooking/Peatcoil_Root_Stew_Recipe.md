# Peatcoil_Root_Stew_Recipe

**Origin/Provenance:** Scribbled by Cook Orlen after experimenting with peatcoil roots and glowspore stock.

**Cultural Tie:** Pole-walkers drink it before night rope runs; Saltmarrow sailors find it too earthy but respect the stamina boost.

**Gameplay Hook:** Cooking recipe using peatcoil roots and [Glowspore_Tallow](../Crafting/Glowspore_Tallow.md) to grant slow health regeneration in toxic areas.
