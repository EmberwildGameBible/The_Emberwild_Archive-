# Steeped_Cedar_Stew_Recipe

**Origin/Provenance:** Passed between Timberline cooks who simmered stag shanks with cedar needles during early frost storms.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak crews swear by the broth before slide runs; Marrowhook couriers find the cedar notes “like home smoke.”

**Gameplay Hook:** Cooking recipe using [Frostbriar_Stag_Shanks](Frostbriar_Stag_Shanks.md) to craft a chill-resistant stew for Frostbriar events and Ashen Cry prep.
