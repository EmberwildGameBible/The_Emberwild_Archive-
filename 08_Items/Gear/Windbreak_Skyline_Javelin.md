# Windbreak Skyline Javelin (Item ID: 50511)

Ash-wood spear balanced with sailcloth fins, built by lookout crews stationed above [Windbreak Post](../../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) to signal storms.

## Cultural Tie
Used to mark sky lanes for airship beacons and avalanche warnings. The haft is etched with the same ropeway codes recorded in the [Pole Grease Chit](../../09_Artifacts/Pole_Grease_Chit.md).
