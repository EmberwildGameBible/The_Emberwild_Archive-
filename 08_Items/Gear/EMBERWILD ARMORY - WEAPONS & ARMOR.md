# Emberwild Armory — Weapons & Armor

Classic-styled gear ladders that map to dungeons, raids, crafting, and PvP without power creep. Use alongside the item catalog and ingredient lists when building loot tables.

## Weapons by Tier
- **Leveling Greens (15–35):** Broad availability through quests and vendors; slower swings with higher top-end for tanks, faster swings for rogues/hunters. No procs to keep pace modest.
- **Dungeon Blues (30–55):** Named drops with small identity hooks (elemental damage, threat bonuses, bonus heal on crit). Internal cooldowns on procs to prevent burst metas.
- **Raid Epics (40–60):** Signature weapon per wing with a single, telegraphed proc that aligns with the encounter theme (frost slows in ice wings, fire cleave in magma wings). Unique equip to avoid stacking effects.
- **PvP Rewards:** Trade raw DPS for control/utility (mini-snares, spell pushback resistance). Tuned for battleground pacing rather than raid dominance.

## Armor Sets
- **Pre-Raid Crafted Sets:** Blacksmithing (plate/mail), Leatherworking (leather/mail), Tailoring (cloth) each deliver a 4-piece starter set with +hit and role tags (tank/physical/heal/caster). Slightly below dungeon blues on raw stats but offer resist/utility.
- **Dungeon Class Sets:** 6-piece blues spread across wings; 2-piece bonuses are rotational, 4-piece add minor survivability/regen, 6-piece is cosmetic to preserve balance.
- **Raid Tier Sets:** 8-piece epics; 2-piece is identity (rage generation, extra HoT tick), 4-piece is throughput, 6-piece utility, 8-piece is signature but encounter-limited. Avoid permanent cooldown reduction.
- **Resistance Capsules:** Small side-grade pieces (cloak, belt, ring) with elemental resist for attunements and specific bosses. Not required for baseline clears.

## Access & Sources
- **Quests & Attunements:** Signature slot rewards for completing attunement arcs (key trinkets, resist cloaks). Keeps narrative tied to progression.
- **Crafting Hooks:** Profession-only variants (blacksmith-only weapon oils, tailoring-only cloak linings) that are competitive early but naturally phase out with later tiers.
- **World Drops:** Sparse epic world drops remain exciting but balanced: no unique auras that warp class rotations.

## Balance Notes
- No weapon should grant permanent haste; short bursts only with clear cooldowns.
- Armor procs should be defensive or utility focused, not raw damage multipliers.
- Resist and profession gear should fill gaps, not replace dungeon/raid progression.
