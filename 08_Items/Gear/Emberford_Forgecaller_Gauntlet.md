# Emberford Forgecaller Gauntlet

## Origin/Provenance
Stamped from slag plates left after a smelter surge and quenched in ventwater. A scorched margin note in the [Emberford Marketwalk zone overview](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Zone_Overview.md) calls it the glove that saved a rail yard forge when bellows failed.

## Cultural Tie
Gauntlets like this are hung above furnace doors to honor the smith who kept the fires burning. Its sigils match those in the [Greatwood gear loadout guide](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B110%20%E2%80%93%20Combat%20Roles%20&%20Build%20Archetypes%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), showing how Emberford shares techniques with lodge allies.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic glove that reheats ingots instantly and prevents burns on magma nodes. Adds Mining and Smithing bonuses during [Emberford smelter events](../../06_Systems/Professions.md) and grants a temporary fire ward while channeling furnaces.
