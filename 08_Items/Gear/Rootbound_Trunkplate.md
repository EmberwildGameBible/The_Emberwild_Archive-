# Rootbound_Trunkplate

**Origin/Provenance:** Chestplate lined with layered bark and sporefelt, templated off Warren tunnel supports.

**Cultural Tie:** Riverwatch guards trade fungus oil to keep it from drying; Hollowroot clans etch family spirals along the ribs.

**Gameplay Hook:** Chest gear that stacks armor when standing near mushrooms and grants thorns against cone attacks; continues the Rootbound Mycelium set and notes [Rootbound_Path_Brief](../../09_Artifacts/Rootbound_Path_Brief.md).
