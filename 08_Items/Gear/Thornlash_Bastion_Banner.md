# Thornlash Bastion Banner (Item ID: 50506)

## Origin/Provenance
Canvas reinforced with tarred briar fiber, raised above the [Thornlash Palisade](../../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md) to signal when walls hold or crack.

## Cultural Tie
Carried by wall captains who survived both Saltmarrow squalls and Frostbriar slides. Its crimson trim matches ration docket stamps used by the palisade quartermasters.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary back piece that pulses a short fortify aura after planting. Grants extra reputation with wall factions and unlocks a bonus defense option in the "Bastion Banner" quest chain from [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
