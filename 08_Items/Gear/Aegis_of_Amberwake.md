# Aegis_of_Amberwake

**Origin/Provenance:** Bulwark shield cast from amberwake slag plates and riveted with ferry hook iron by Emberford quay smiths after a barge crash sent molten rails into the docks.

**Cultural Tie:** Marketwalk wardens etch shift sigils along the rim; veterans notch tide marks showing which ferry lanes they’ve held through sprite swarms.

**Gameplay Hook:** Tank shield with bonus fire resistance, ferry-impact knockback dampening, and a taunt cone that briefly reveals smugglers hiding behind quay crates; required for the Kiln Soot Samples investigation thread.

**Secondary Artifact — Dockside Impact Ledger:**
> A soot-smeared ledger page pinned beside the Marketwalk quest board lists which captains borrowed the Aegis, with red ink warnings about smuggler coin-gouges along its edge.
