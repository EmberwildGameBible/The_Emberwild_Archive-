# Thornlash_Sentry_Wristwraps

**Origin/Provenance:** Pitch-lined leather wraps stitched from palisade saplings and ash-drift burlap, issued to Thornlash wall sentries after rope bridge planks splintered during a smuggler raid.

**Cultural Tie:** Marrowhook runners trade extra wraps for smuggling favors; Frostbriar carpenters weave their own briar-resin cords into the bracers as a badge of emergency repairs.

**Gameplay Hook:** Wrist slot that boosts block while bracing ropes, adds bleed resistance versus briar beasts, and grants a short sprint after parrying pallet-thief mobs on the palisade ramparts.

**Secondary Artifact — Sentry Ration Docket Addendum:**
> A charcoal scrawl on the ration docket lists which guard shifts wore wristwraps soaked in briar resin, noting which pairs kept their rope lines from icing over during the last ash drift.
