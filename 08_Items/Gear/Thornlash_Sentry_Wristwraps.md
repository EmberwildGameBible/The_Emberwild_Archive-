# Thornlash Sentry Wristwraps

Stiffened leather wraps lined with pitch-stained rope bands to keep ash grit out of joints.

- Origin/Provenance: Cut from surplus sled harness leather at [Thornlash Palisade](../../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md) after wall repairs.
- Cultural tie: Slidecaller lookouts etch bell tallies into the inside lining; Marrowhook smugglers add salt-score notches beside them.
- Gameplay hook: Grants bonus grip during escort sled events and reduces ash drift slow; discounted after finishing [Thornlash Palisade Duties](../../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md).
