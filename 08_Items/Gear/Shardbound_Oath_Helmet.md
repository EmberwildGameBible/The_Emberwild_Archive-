# Shardbound_Oath_Helmet

**Origin/Provenance:** Helm banded with shatterglass strips recovered from the Crypt antechamber.

**Cultural Tie:** Riverwatch oath-takers etch their vows along the inside rim so they “hear the echo” each time they look up.

**Gameplay Hook:** Head gear reflecting a portion of spell damage and revealing invisible shards; first piece of the Shardbound Covenant set tied to [Shardbound_Challenge_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Shardbound_Challenge_Note.md).
