# Gatewarden_Ventbreaker_Bulwark

**Origin/Provenance:** Shield welded from vent grates torn off the Gatewarden’s platform and rimmed with slagglass.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford line-holders paint bridge numbers on the rim to show which span they defended against fissures.

**Gameplay Hook:** Shield that grants a vent-interrupt cooldown refund and reflects fire bolts; defeating Gatewarden with it equipped awards extra key fragments and updates [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
