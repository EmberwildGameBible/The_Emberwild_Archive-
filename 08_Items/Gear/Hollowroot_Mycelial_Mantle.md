# Hollowroot Mycelial Matriarch's Mantle (Item ID: 50505)

## Origin/Provenance
Layered sporecloth cloak stitched by warren midwives beneath the [Hollowroot Warren](../../06_Systems/Dungeons/Hollowroot_Warren/Dungeon_Overview.md) glowcaps. Spores harvested from matriarchal rings give the mantle its shimmer.

## Cultural Tie
Worn by those who negotiate peace between tunnel clans and the surface traders. The clasp bears the same spiral found in the [Hollowroot Sporelight Lantern](../Trinkets/Hollowroot_Sporelight_Lantern.md) sigilwork.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary cloak that adds poison resist and converts overheal into a burst of spores that heal allies. Needed for the "Matriarch’s Oath" quest finale in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md) and cited in the warren rumor slip and birthing ledger.
