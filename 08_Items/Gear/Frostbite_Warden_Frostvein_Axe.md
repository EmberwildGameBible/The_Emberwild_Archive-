# Frostbite_Warden_Frostvein_Axe

**Origin/Provenance:** Axe carved from frozen briar knots that formed around the Frostbite Warden’s binding pillar.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak cutters whisper that the axe rings with the same tone as Shiverhook warning bells when swung across rope spans.

**Gameplay Hook:** Cleave weapon that stacks slow on brittle targets; gains extra chill when used near extinguished vents in Ashen Cry. Claiming it updates [Slidecaller_Field_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Slidecaller_Field_Note.md).
