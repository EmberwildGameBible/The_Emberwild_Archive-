# Burn Scar Clinkerbreaker Cudgel (Item ID: 50509)

## Origin/Provenance
Hammered from slag nodules found along the [Burn Scar Descent](../../06_Systems/Dungeons/Burn_Scar_Descent/Dungeon_Overview.md) ramps, wrapped in vent-charred leather.

## Cultural Tie
Used by vent crews to smash clinker that blocks the descent lifts. Its handle is carved with the same tally marks noted in the Burn Scar freight permits.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary mace that applies stacking sunder to armored targets and grants fire absorb while stationary. Dropped by the Clinker Colossus in the updated Burn Scar loot table and required for the "Clinkerbreaker" quest route in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
