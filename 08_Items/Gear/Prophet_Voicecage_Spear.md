# Prophet_Voicecage_Spear

**Origin/Provenance:** Spear capped with a cage of whispering wires pulled from the Warren Prophet’s pit.

**Cultural Tie:** Riverwatch veterans say the cage hums with every lie told nearby, so they carry it into parlay tents.

**Gameplay Hook:** Polearm that silences targets hit after a reflect and grants haste when phasing adds die; obtained from Warren Prophet and linked to [Shardbound_Challenge_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Shardbound_Challenge_Note.md).
