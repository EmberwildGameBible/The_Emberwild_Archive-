# Timberline_Sled_Rails

**Origin/Provenance:** Forged from frost-hardened pine and iron by Timberline Post sledwrights after the ash vent collapse.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak crews notch personal patterns into the rails; Marrowhook couriers paint salt stripes to keep them from being “borrowed.”

**Gameplay Hook:** Upgrade for sled escort events and Frostbriar world quests; reduces slide damage and required for Slidecaller event achievements.
