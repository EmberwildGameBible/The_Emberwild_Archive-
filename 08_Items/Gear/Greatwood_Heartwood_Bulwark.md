# Greatwood Heartwood Bulwark

## Origin/Provenance
Carved from an elder heartwood fallen near Lodge Crossing and plated with river-iron rivets. Wardens still pass around a moss-stained hunt board chit that lists the shield as collateral for a debt paid in briar sap, proof it served on raids before the current season.

## Cultural Tie
The bulwark is a badge of Lodge oath-keepers in Greatwood, carried by captains who arbitrate disputes along the rivers. Its crest mirrors the sigil used in the [Greatwood item flavor pack](../Regions/Greatwood%20-%20ITEM%20FLAVOR%20PACK.md), signalling amnesty to sap-haulers moving between camps.

## Gameplay Hook
Tanking shield with a nature resist seal that smiths can reforge and enchanters can socket for raid pulls against poison-heavy beasts. It also boosts block when guarding caravan NPCs in [Greatwood onboarding flows](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B111%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20Onboarding%20%26%20Player%20Flow%20(1%E2%80%9320).md).
