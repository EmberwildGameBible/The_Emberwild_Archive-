# Saltmarrow Tidecourt Cutlass

## Origin/Provenance
Forged from brine-tempered steel and balanced with driftwood grip rings. A captain's log in the [Saltmarrow Strand zone overview](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Zone_Overview.md) notes this blade ending a deck duel that decided dock tariffs.

## Cultural Tie
Deckhands etch their crew mark into the pommel after a successful voyage, so seasoned blades read like travel diaries. The guard design matches motifs listed in the [dock rep bonuses](../../GameBible/Future/Features/84%20%E2%80%93%20Lodge%20Economy,%20Vendors,%20and%20Currencies%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), signifying trusted passage.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic sword that channels a brine bleed enchant and grants faster deck maneuvers. Boosts Sailing skill checks during [dockside systems](../../06_Systems/Docks_and_Sailing.md) and improves parry speed when fighting near tides.
