# Glimmerdeep Deepforge Lantern

## Origin/Provenance
Cast in prismglass and fitted with rune mirrors from the first Delveguard expedition. A shipping slate tucked in the [Glimmerdeep Mire world event](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Glimmerdeep_Mire_World_Event.md) cites this lantern as the light that held when three other torches failed.

## Cultural Tie
Lanterns like this hang outside Glimmerdeep smithies when a craftsperson accepts an apprentice, signalling a night of stories and shared stew. The mirrored panels are etched with patterns common to [Glimmerdeep Mire subareas](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Glimmerdeep_Mire_Subareas_and_POIs.md), marking the maker's lineage.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary off-hand that doubles enchantment focus range and reveals hidden ore seams in dark caverns. Counts as a light source that boosts perception during [delve travel plans](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md), improving mining procs for parties.
