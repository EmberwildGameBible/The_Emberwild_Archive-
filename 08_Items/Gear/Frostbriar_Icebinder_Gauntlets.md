# Frostbriar Icebinder Gauntlets

## Origin/Provenance
Forged with layered froststeel and lined in seal fur to keep fingers nimble. A repair chit tucked in the [Frostbriar Reach settlements sheet](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Frostbriar_Reach_Settlements.md) logs the gauntlets after they stopped a blizzard-cracked door from collapsing.

## Cultural Tie
Gauntlets like these are gifted when a smith earns the right to tend the communal forge. The engravings echo patterns from the [Frostbriar gear tuning matrix](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B125%20%E2%80%93%20Status%20&%20Damage%20Tuning%20Matrix%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), signifying mastery over frostbite risks.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic gloves that socket frostthread runes and enhance chilled weapon imbues. Reduce crafting failures for cold alloys and grant grip bonuses during [ice-laden travel](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Overview.md) or when climbing frozen ledges.
