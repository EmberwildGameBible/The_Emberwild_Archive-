# Refraction_Judge_Prismpalm

**Origin/Provenance:** Gauntlet laced with mirror shards cut from the Judge’s dais, padded with slagfelt.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford glasscutters barter for fragments, believing they deflect gossip as well as spells.

**Gameplay Hook:** Hand gear that converts blocked fire into a brief spell reflect and boosts fissure soak; looted from Refraction Judge and tied to [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
