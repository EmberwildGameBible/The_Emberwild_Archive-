# Slagrunner_Blast_Mask

**Origin/Provenance:** Mask patched together by Burn Scar bridge crews from slagcloth and cracked visors recovered after Root-King charges.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford vent-haulers paint soot bands across the cheeks to show how many freight runs they survived.

**Gameplay Hook:** Head gear that cuts fire DoT duration and grants clarity during vent flares; part of the Slagrunner Signal set that pings [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
