# Greatwood Warden Thorncloak

## Origin/Provenance
Woven from briarfiber harvested along the Thornlash palisades and lined with river-silk. A hunt board stub stored with the [Thornlash palisade brief](../../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md) notes the cloak being awarded after clearing a corrupted grove.

## Cultural Tie
Wardens drape the thorncloak over the lodge doorway when calling for volunteers. The embroidered antlers mirror motifs in the [Greatwood gear themes](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B107%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20Gear%20%26%20Loot%20Themes%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), tying it to ranger rites.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic cloak that stitches a briar ward proc and amplifies nature resist for off-tanks. Tailors gain extra skill checks when finishing it during [Greatwood profession loops](../../06_Systems/Professions.md), and it adds bleed thorns when blocking.
