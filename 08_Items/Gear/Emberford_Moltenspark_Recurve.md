# Emberford Moltenspark Recurve

## Origin/Provenance
Crafted from soot-black yew cured above the Emberford smelters and strung with tempered fireglass filament. A charred tag from the [Emberford Marketwalk](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Zone_Index.md) auction lists this bow as a guild lot that ignited when tested.

## Cultural Tie
Hunters in Emberford gift the bow to rangers who hold the line against vent-flare beasts. The fireglass inlay matches motifs from the [Emberford travel lanes](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Emberford_Travel_Lanes.md), signaling its place in city defense lore.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary bow that imprints fireglass arrowheads and adds a burn DoT for raid bosses. Fletchers earn bonus skill ticks when using it during [profession questlines](../../06_Systems/Professions.md), and its proc accelerates vent-clear encounters.
