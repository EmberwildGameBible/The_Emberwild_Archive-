# Emberford Scoria-Draw Harpoon (Item ID: 50500)

## Origin/Provenance
Vented steel barbed in the [Emberford Marketwalk](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Zone_Index.md) forges, tempered by dragging it through live scoria flow. The haft bears tags from the smelter crews who haul slag toward Windbreak Post.

## Cultural Tie
Issued to ventline fishers who spear ash-finned leviathans before they breach the ferry lanes. Its etched warning flares mirror the kiln sigils found along the [Emberford travel lanes](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Emberford_Travel_Lanes.md).

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary polearm that stacks a bleed when used after a successful interrupt; bonus movement in lava slicks. Required to finish the "Scoria Draw" quest finale in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md) and tracked by the accompanying rumor slips and permits.
