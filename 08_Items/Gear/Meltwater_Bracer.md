# Meltwater_Bracer

**Origin/Provenance:** Leather bracer lined with cedar wool, soaked in meltwater to hold chill-dispersing herbs.

**Cultural Tie:** Timberline healers loan these to sledders before ridge runs; Marrowhook couriers copy the design for sea spray.

**Gameplay Hook:** Minor wrist gear that reduces chill stacks and is required for the Embermouth dousing quest.
