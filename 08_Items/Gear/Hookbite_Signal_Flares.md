# Hookbite Signal Flares

Tin-can flares painted with blue resin for coastal visibility.

- Origin/Provenance: Forged at Hookbite Lookout using scrap anchor chain and resin shipped from Emberford Marketwalk.
- Cultural tie: Night watch rotates the right to fire the first flare at dusk, a small honor among palisade crews.
- Gameplay hook: Used to mark safe courier routes and lure [Kelpback Bulwark](../../03_Lore/Creatures/Kelpback_Bulwark.md) away from nets.
