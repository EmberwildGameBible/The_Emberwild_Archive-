# APPENDIX B — RESIST GEAR & SET BONUS TABLES (FINAL)

Emberwild: Elemental, Spirit & Horizontal Endgame Gear Rules

This appendix defines:

- Full resistance gear systems
- Tier-by-tier resist budgets
- Spirit-Realm resistance rules
- Set bonus categories
- Class-agnostic set principles
- Zone-tied resist types
- How resist gear plugs into combat math
- Horizontal endgame gear pathways (T9/T10)

All resist gear must obey Chapter 1 (identity), Chapter 2 (combat math), and Appendix A (budget logic).

# B.1 RESISTANCE SYSTEM OVERVIEW

############################################################

### B.1.1 Resist Types

Emberwild uses five resist types, adapted from Classic WoW but re-themed:

- Fire Resistance (FR)
- Frost Resistance (FoR)
- Nature Resistance (NR)
- Shadow Resistance (SR)
- Spirit Resistance (SpR)
    
    (Spirit Resistance replaces “Arcane” to fit the Emberwild spirit-plane system.)
    

These resistances interact with:

- Spell hit vs resist tables
- Partial resist math (25% / 50% / 75%)
- Special boss mechanics
- Spirit Realm environmental auras

All formulas live in Chapter 4.

---

### B.1.2 Resist Gear Tiers

Resist gear appears primarily at:

- T6 (Midgame dungeons: partial zone-themed resist sets)
- T7 (Pre-endgame areas: hybrid zone/spirit resist)
- T8 (Endgame dungeons: tuned resist pieces)
- T9 (Horizontal L60: full resist sets, multi-resist, high utility)
- T10 (Epic questlines: specialized fight-specific resist gear)
- T11 (Legendary paths: unique resist effect pieces)

Everything below T6 has negligible resist values except rare exceptions.

---

############################################################

# B.2 RESISTANT GEAR STAT BUDGET RULES

############################################################

### B.2.1 Resist Weight (from Appendix A)

1 resist = 0.3 budget cost

Example:

+20 Fire Resist → cost = 6 budget

---

### B.2.2 Resist Cap Philosophy

Resist caps follow Classic-style diminishing returns:

- Soft cap: 120 resist (strong partial resists)
- Hard cap: 240–315 resist (only achievable with full sets + consumables)
- Boss tuning: Endgame bosses expect partial resist, not full resist spam

No single item may exceed:

- +25 resist (general)
- +40 resist (T10–T11 specialized pieces only)

---

### B.2.3 Slot Resist Priority

Certain slots tend toward higher resist values:

- Head / Chest / Legs: primary resist pieces
- Boots / Gloves / Belt: mid-tier resist
- Rings / Cloak / Trinkets: auxiliary resist
- Weapons: only thematic resist, very low values
- Shields: can hold resist + block effects

---

# B.3 ELEMENT-TIED ZONE RESIST TABLES

############################################################

These define which regions grant which resist gear types.

Used for world-building, drop tables & rare logic.
