# Emberford Charred Keystone

## Origin/Provenance
A volcanic stone carved from the lip of an overpressured vent, its faces blackened and rune-scribed. A survey note in the [Emberford travel lanes](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Emberford_Travel_Lanes.md) lists the keystone as the marker used to redirect a lava trickle.

## Cultural Tie
Rail crews carry the keystone when opening new shafts, believing it wards off bad luck. The runes echo patterns from the [Runesmithing notes](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B109%20%E2%80%93%20Damage%20Types,%20Status%20Effects%20&%20Corruption%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), connecting Emberford magi to lodge ritualists.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic trinket-stone that holds an extra rune charge and senses magma vents. Provides bonuses to Mining and Runesmithing during [vent clearing events](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Events.md) and grants a small fire shield when socketed.
