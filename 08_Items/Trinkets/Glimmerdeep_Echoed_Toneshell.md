# Glimmerdeep Echoed Toneshell

## Origin/Provenance
Formed from a cavern conch that survived a cave-in and still reverberates when tapped. A rumor scrap pinned to the [Glimmerdeep Mire world event](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Glimmerdeep_Mire_World_Event.md) claims its echo guided a lost patrol back to camp.

## Cultural Tie
Delvers hang toneshells over camp doors to warn of tremors. The carved runes match symbols logged in the [Glimmerdeep travel template](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md), letting crews coordinate rhythm signals in the dark.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic trinket-totem that stores extra echo charges and projects sonar for scouting. Adds perception bonuses for Arcanism and Musician roles during [Glimmerdeep exploration](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Index.md).
