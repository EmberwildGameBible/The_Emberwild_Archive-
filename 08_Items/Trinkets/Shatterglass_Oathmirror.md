# Shatterglass Oathmirror (Item ID: 50508)

## Origin/Provenance
Cut from the mirrored crypt stones within the [Shatterglass Crypt](../../06_Systems/Dungeons/Shatterglass_Crypt/Dungeon_Overview.md) and set into a silver frame etched by oathkeepers.

## Cultural Tie
Used by penitent cryptwalkers to swear off grave-robbing; the mirror mutes sound like the [Silent Bell](../../01_World/Canon_List.md) myths whispered in Marketwalk alleys.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary off-hand that reflects a portion of spell damage and reveals invisible foes for five seconds after blocking. Drops from the Crypt Judge according to the updated loot tables and closes the "Oathmirror" quest in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
