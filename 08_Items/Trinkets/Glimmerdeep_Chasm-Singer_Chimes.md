# Glimmerdeep Chasm-Singer Chimes (Item ID: 50503)

## Origin/Provenance
Cast from prismheart shards salvaged near the [Glimmerdeep Shore Hub](../../07_Quests/Glimmerdeep_Shore_Hub.md) ropeways and tuned by cavern chanters who echo-map the tunnels.

## Cultural Tie
Broker Vesha’s pole-walkers carry the chimes to warn Mire divers of vent eruptions. The lattice matches sigils in the [Mire Salvage Chain](../../07_Quests/Mire_Salvage_Chain.md) ledgers.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary trinket that grants a brief stealth while stationary in water and increases drop chance of glowspore reagents. Featured in the "Chasm Singer" quest finale inside [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md) and cited on the chasm rumor scrap and salvage permit.
