# Prism_Verdict_Signet

**Origin/Provenance:** Ring set with refracted ashglass chips collected after the Judge’s prism collapse.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford arbitrators carry copies to hearings as proof they’ve walked the Descent.

**Gameplay Hook:** Trinket granting spell crit when reflecting or interrupting; adds bonus loot if both Judge and Gatewarden are defeated within timer. Recording it updates [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
