# Hollowroot Warrenlord War-drum

## Origin/Provenance
Stretched with bog boar hide and fitted to a root-ring frame salvaged from a collapsed warren. A tavern rumor scrap from Dewfall Inn notes the drum being traded for safe passage through spore-choked tunnels.

## Cultural Tie
Bog clans beat this drum when declaring truce or vengeance, and its cadence is used to rally tunnel runners. The carved knots echo patterns cataloged in the [Hollowroot ritual notes](../../01_World/Continuity_Issues.md), making it a recognizable badge of status.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary trinket-instrument that grants a group sprint on pull and lets leatherworkers retune hide tension for haste chants. Adds morale bonuses in [Hollowroot event chains](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Events.md) where escorts risk ambush.
