# Hierarchs_Glassbound_Rosary

**Origin/Provenance:** Prayer beads fused from shattered ashglass reliquaries recovered after the Hierarch’s collapse.

**Cultural Tie:** Glimmerdeep pole-walkers trade the beads as hazard pay charms; Windbreak clergy grind them into ink for warning placards.

**Gameplay Hook:** Trinket that pulses a smoke cleanse when you pick up vent keys and increases crit chance against burning foes. Recording it adds lines to [Slidecaller_Field_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Slidecaller_Field_Note.md).
