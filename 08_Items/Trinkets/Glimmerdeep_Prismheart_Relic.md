# Glimmerdeep Prismheart Relic

## Origin/Provenance
Cut from a faultless prism heart stone discovered during the first Crystalwake melt. A priest's note in the [Glimmerdeep Mire overview](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Overview.md) claims the relic hummed until engraved with sigils.

## Cultural Tie
Relics like this sit above shrine doors in Glimmerdeep to signal safe passage for delvers. Jewelcrafters trace its facets back to the [Glimmerdeep item catalog](../ITEM_CATALOG%20-%20THOUSANDFOLD_CLASSIC_STOCK.md), saying it embodies the region's light-binding craft.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary trinket that stores extra socket charges and lets jewelcrafters cut flawless prisms for portal anchors. Boosts arcane crit and portal stability during [zone travel events](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Index.md).
