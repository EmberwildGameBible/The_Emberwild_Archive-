# Hollowroot Sporelight Lantern

## Origin/Provenance
Built from bogglass jars wrapped in root wire, first lit by herbalists tracing spores back to an abandoned barrow. A field guide note in the [Hollowroot travel template](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md) records the lantern saving a patrol when torches failed.

## Cultural Tie
Lanterns like this are hung outside mushroom drying sheds to ward off rot spirits. The patterns on the wire mimic glyphs cited in the [Hollowroot ritual entries](../../01_World/Continuity_Issues.md), making it a recognizable artisan piece.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic trinket lantern that reveals hidden fungi and extends potion durations through harvested spores. Adds Herbalism bonuses during [Hollowroot exploration](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Events.md) and boosts light radius in swamp fog.
