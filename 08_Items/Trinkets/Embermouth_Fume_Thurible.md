# Embermouth_Fume_Thurible

**Origin/Provenance:** Thurible welded from vent caps seized off Embermouth Vicar acolytes during Shiverhook counter-raids.

**Cultural Tie:** Glimmerdeep chanters swap soot-polish recipes to keep the chains from sticking; Windbreak sledders just call it the "smoke bucket."

**Gameplay Hook:** Trinket that stacks fire resistance the longer you stand near active vents; amplifies meltwater bucket healing in the Embermouth encounter. Unlocking it flags [Slidecaller_Field_Note](../../09_Artifacts/Slidecaller_Field_Note.md).
