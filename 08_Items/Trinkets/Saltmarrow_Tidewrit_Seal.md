# Saltmarrow Tidewrit Seal (Item ID: 50501)

## Origin/Provenance
Stamped in barnacled brass by the Saltcourt scribes who notarize strand debts. The seal was dredged from the [Saltmarrow Strand](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Saltmarrow_Strand.md) shoals near the Drowned Archive markers.

## Cultural Tie
Couriers press the seal into wax to prove tide taxes were paid; the crest matches the thornlash ferries that shuttle between [Strandline Courier Loop](../../07_Quests/Strandline_Courier_Loop.md) waystations.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary trinket that grants water-walking for 10 seconds after opening chests and increases reputation gains with dock factions. Needed to authenticate the "Tidewrit Debts" chain inside [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md) and flagged by the ledger slip artifacts.
