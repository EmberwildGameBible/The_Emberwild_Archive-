# Frostbriar Rimebound Relay (Item ID: 50502)

## Origin/Provenance
Forged from linked shiversteel plates recovered along the [Frostbriar Trail Hub](../../07_Quests/Frostbriar_Trail_Hub.md) sled routes and tuned by Slidecallers to carry whistle-codes through blizzards.

## Cultural Tie
Passed between ridge runners who escort freight across the avalanche lanes to [Thornlash Palisade](../../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md). The relay’s braided cord mirrors the red chalk marks on the Gravemark switchbacks.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary neck slot that reduces slow effects and pings nearby group members when a frost hazard is incoming. Required to stabilize the third step of the "Rimebound Signal" line in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md) and mentioned in the runner’s rumor slip.
