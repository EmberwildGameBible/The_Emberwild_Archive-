# Shardcallers_Periapt

**Origin/Provenance:** Pendant strung with chips swept from beneath the Glass Sentinel after its collapse.

**Cultural Tie:** Hollowroot herbalists say the shards buzz when spores overheat, so they keep one near drying racks.

**Gameplay Hook:** Trinket that grants bonus crit against marked targets and small healing pulses when reflecting beams; picking it up adds lines to [Rootbound_Path_Brief](../../09_Artifacts/Rootbound_Path_Brief.md).
