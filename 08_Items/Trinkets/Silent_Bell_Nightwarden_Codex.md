# Silent Bell Nightwarden Codex (Item ID: 50510)

## Origin/Provenance
Compiled by covert wardens who watch for Silent Bell activity beneath the [Emberford Marketwalk](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Zone_Index.md). The vellum bears ink dusted with ground bell metal.

## Cultural Tie
Carried by informants trading proof to both shrinekeepers and ferrymen. The margins cite the same names whispered in the [Windbreak Bounty Board](../../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) postings.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary off-hand tome that boosts shadow resistance and reveals smuggling caches on the minimap while stealthed. Required to negotiate the "Nightwarden" finale in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md) and mentioned in the codex rumor slip and forged pass.
