# Item Catalog — Thousandfold Classic Stock

Classic-friendly bulk pack that seeds over a thousand new items by expanding four proven supply lines with affix-ready variants.

## Batch 201–450 — Emberford Marketwalk Militia Surplus {#batch-201}
Category: Gear & Consumables (light armor, ammo, bandages)  
Count: 250 base items with A/B/C suffixes for resist, stamina, or precision.

Sample base names: Marketwalk Trooper's Tabard, Emberford Patrol Greaves, Ember-stitched Wristwraps, Ashlantern Buckler, Ridgeward Scout Bracers, Garrison Throwing Hammers, Barrel-Cured Field Rations, Braided Rope Bandage, Emberford Muster Horn, Lantern-Polish Kit.

Origin:
- Marketwalk quartermasters dumped last season's stock into civilian stalls once caravans from [Emberford Marketwalk Quest Hub](../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Emberford_Marketwalk_Quest_Hub.md) started buying surplus rope and signal kits.
- The crates include mislabeled drills sent toward [Gravemark Switchbacks](../02_Regions/Gravemark_Switchbacks.md) and recalled when cliff patrols switched to lighter gear.

Cultural Tie:
- Emberford shopkeeps bundle the surplus for militia hopefuls who want to look the part before they earn a badge, treating the tabard swap as a neighborhood rite.
- Marketwalk gamblers trade wristwraps and bucklers as ante for evening dice games outside the [Emberford Marketwalk Gazette — Issue 1 (Spring)](../09_Artifacts/Gazette/Emberford_Marketwalk_Gazette_Issue_1_Spring.md) print runs.

Gameplay Hook:
- Early dungeon runs gain reliable armor/resist filler; suffixes let tanks choose stamina while ranged recruits grab precision ammo or crit-friendly throwing hammers.
- Bandages and rations shortcut downtime between Marketwalk errands, letting players chain quests without sitting.

## Batch 451–700 — Saltmarrow Strand Brine Salvage {#batch-451}
Category: Nautical Gear & Fishing Supports  
Count: 250 base items with "brine-tight" waterproofing, tuned for Wet/Cold affixes.

Sample base names: Saltmarrow Trident Haft, Brine-Tight Line Reels, Hookbite Diver's Belt, Tide-Slick Cloak, Strand Net Needles, Stormlash Harpoon, Coral-Laced Anklets, Salt-Scored Wading Boots, Tidecaller's Signal Gong, Driftwood Charms.

Origin:
- Salvors along [Saltmarrow Strand](../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Saltmarrow_Strand.md) stripped shipbreak hulks, repurposing masts into harpoons and braiding tarp scraps into waterproof scrips.
- Fishers returning from [Glimmerdeep Mire](../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Overview.md) trade glowspore-coated hooks for clean brine-tight reels to handle eel runs.

Cultural Tie:
- Tidecallers inscribe coral anklets with crew names before long hauls; losing one is a superstition for bad weather and lost catches.
- Strand divers paint tiny sharks on harpoon shafts as thanks to the [Hookbite Signal Flares](../08_Items/Gear/Hookbite_Signal_Flares.md) crews who watch their ascent ropes.

Gameplay Hook:
- Swappable waterproofing makes these great pre-raid kits for aquatic bosses; Wet/Cold affixes bolster resist sets without needing rare drops.
- Fishing perks: reinforced reels and net needles boost catch stability while cloaks and belts grant brief swim-speed bursts during coastal pulls.

## Batch 701–950 — Frostbriar Reach Field Issue {#batch-701}
Category: Cold-Weather Gear & Survival Kits  
Count: 250 base items with Frost/Defense affix ladders.

Sample base names: Frostbriar Woolbound Mantle, Ventwatch Climber's Spikes, Icewhistle Hand Warmers, Briar-Fur Mitts, Frostline Shoulder Guards, Sleet-Forged Hatchets, Briartorch Lanterns, Driftpine Sled Lashings, Ice-Studded Tabi, Glarecut Goggles.

Origin:
- Ventwatch sentries in [Frostbriar Reach](../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Overview.md) stash spares after blizzard rotations, leaving piles of mitts and mantles in cliffside caches.
- Ropeway crews from [Ropeway Repair Docket](../09_Artifacts/Ropeway_Repair_Docket.md) sold extra lashings and spikes to fund repairs before the winter caravans cut funding.

Cultural Tie:
- Local hunters stitch clan patterns into mitts; wearing the wrong embroidery without permission is rude and flagged by Frostbriar elders.
- Briar-torch lanterns burn resin tithed from [Resin Ration Tally](../09_Artifacts/Resin_Ration_Tally.md) quotas; misuse earns side-eye at the braziers.

Gameplay Hook:
- Perfect for pre-raid resist checks: gloves and mantles slot Frost/Defense affixes so tanks hit caps without sacrificing damage.
- Survival kits bundle heat sources and sled lashings, reducing travel fatigue during long pull chains between ridge events and ropeways.

## Batch 951–1200 — Glimmerdeep Mire Alchemy Drafts {#batch-951}
Category: Potions, Coatings, and Toxins  
Count: 250 base items with potency ranks (Minor/Standard/Strong) and dual-stat suffixes.

Sample base names: Glowspore Resin Draught, Mirestep Tonic, Leechtwine Bile Flask, Sunkelp Smoke Bomb, Mirewatch Vigil Salve, Lantern-Eel Oil, Thornscrip Edge Coating, Marshlight Focus Draught, Bogblood Barrier Vial, Gloomvine Venom.

Origin:
- Marsh apothecaries within [Glimmerdeep Mire](../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Overview.md) learned to skim resin from glowspore blooms, bottling drafts for traders bound to Emberford.
- Potion brokers cited in [Ledger Diver Brief](../09_Artifacts/Ledger_Diver_Brief.md) swap eel oil and bile flasks in hidden docks to dodge tariffs.

Cultural Tie:
- Mire hunters bless edge coatings with whispered thanks to lantern-eels before night runs; skipping the whisper is blamed for lost blades.
- Draft labels carry reed-stamped seals from Glimmerdeep guilds; forging one risks exile to the [Grotto Bell Report](../09_Artifacts/Grotto_Bell_Report.md) watch posts.

Gameplay Hook:
- Consumables provide Classic-style short buffs: focus draughts boost spell crit, barrier vials grant short absorb shields, and smoke bombs reset pulls in tangled marsh fights.
- Edge coatings and toxins pair with rogue and hunter rotations, enabling bleed/poison uptime without rare reagent farming.
