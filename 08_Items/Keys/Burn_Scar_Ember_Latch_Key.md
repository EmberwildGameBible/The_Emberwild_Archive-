# Burn_Scar_Ember_Latch_Key

**Origin/Provenance:** Hooked key hammered from slag nails that once pinned bridge latches shut during vent surges.

**Cultural Tie:** Emberford freight crews engrave their route numbers on the spine to mark safe caches.

**Gameplay Hook:** Opens sealed slag freight crates and grants an extra roll on Gatewarden and Judge if used within one minute of a vent flare; usage is noted in [Slagrunner_Log](../../09_Artifacts/Slagrunner_Log.md).
