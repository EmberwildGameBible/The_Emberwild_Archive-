# Frostbriar Hoarfrost Keyring

## Origin/Provenance
A bundle of cold-tempered keys bound with braided sinew, first used to open the ice gate at Bleak Span. A guard roster tucked in the [Frostbriar Reach index](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Index.md) lists the ring as being issued after a raid on smugglers.

## Cultural Tie
Locksmiths in Frostbriar freeze keyrings in snow overnight before cutting any ward, a tradition said to attune metal to the ice spirits. The braid matches materials described in the [locksmithing primer](../../06_Systems/Professions.md), tying it to guild practice.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic keyring that cuts cold-tempered keys and bypasses frozen gate wards. Grants bonuses to Locksmithing and Exploration during [Frostbriar travel](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Overview.md) and opens shortcuts in ice caverns.
