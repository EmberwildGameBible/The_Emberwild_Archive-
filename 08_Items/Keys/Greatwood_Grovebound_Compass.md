# Greatwood Grovebound Compass

## Origin/Provenance
Built with a heartwood casing and a needle forged from river iron, first aligned at the Grove of Ashen Oaks. A field note in the [Greatwood travel map](../../GameBible/Future/Features/63%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20World%20Map,%20Sub-Regions,%20and%20Points%20of%20Interest.md) records the compass snapping toward a hidden ley line.

## Cultural Tie
Trackers share the compass during rite-of-passage hunts, etching beast tallies into its rim. Its face mirrors sigils listed in the [Greatwood loot tables](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B131%20%E2%80%94%20Greatwood%20Loot%20Tables%20&%20Drop%20Logic%20(Lv%2010%E2%80%9319).md), linking it to ranger traditions.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic compass that tracks forest ley lines and marks beast dens for hunting parties. Provides Cartography and Hunting bonuses during [Greatwood zone travel](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md) and improves tracking for beast-slay quests.
