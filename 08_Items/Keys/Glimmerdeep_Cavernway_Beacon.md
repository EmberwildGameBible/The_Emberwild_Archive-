# Glimmerdeep Cavernway Beacon

## Origin/Provenance
Engineered from a salvaged delve lantern core mounted on a collapsible tripod. A note in the [Glimmerdeep travel overview](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Overview.md) says this beacon marked the route out of the Seamrider collapse when maps failed.

## Cultural Tie
Delve crews light the beacon when calling for a shift change, and its glow color signals which crew controls a tunnel. Its engraved rings mirror diagrams in the [engineering travel template](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md), making it a standard tool for organized teams.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic beacon that teleports a delve team once per day and marks node respawn timers. Grants Engineering and Mining bonuses during [Glimmerdeep runs](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Index.md) and reduces wipe penalties in long tunnels.
