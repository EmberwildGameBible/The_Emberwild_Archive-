# Saltmarrow Leviathan Tally

## Origin/Provenance
Etched from whalebone and knotted with kelp fibers, counted aloud by dock jurors after the Kelp War skirmish. A ledger line in the [Saltmarrow Strand index](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Zone_Index.md) records it being used to open a coral vault during a guild trial.

## Cultural Tie
Tidecallers wear the tally to show they have navigated the labyrinth shoals without losing crew. The knotwork follows patterns seen in [Saltmarrow travel routes](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Zone_Overview.md), making it both key and status symbol.

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary key that charts kelp labyrinth routes and can summon rare tide-beasts at shoals. Provides bonus Fishing and Cartography rolls during [water-margins content](../../GameBible/Future/Features/78%20%E2%80%93%20Fishing%2C%20River%20Foraging%2C%20and%20Water-Margin%20Content%20(1%E2%80%9320).md).
