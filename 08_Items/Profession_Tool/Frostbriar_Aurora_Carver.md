# Frostbriar Aurora Carver

## Origin/Provenance
Forged by icecutters who trace back to the first haul out of Shivercliff. A ledger scrap from the Frostbriar Reach world event lists the chisel as payment to scouts who first mapped the aurora vents.

## Cultural Tie
Stonecutters in Frostbriar display the chisel during thaw feasts, a sign of respect for artisans who brave the blue storms. Apprentices earn handling rights only after guiding elders through the [Frostbriar Reach subareas](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Frostbriar_Reach_Subareas_and_POIs.md).

## Gameplay Hook
Legendary profession tool that prevents material loss when carving froststone, and engraves conduits needed for cold-resist gear upgrades. Grants bonus skill checks during [Frostbriar world events](../../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Frostbriar_Reach_World_Event.md) where brittle ice is a hazard.
