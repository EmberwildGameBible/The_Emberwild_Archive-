# Glimmerdeep Seamrider Pick

## Origin/Provenance
Forged from ore lifted out of the first Seamrider breach and balanced with a glowquartz counterweight. A miner's journal margin in the [Glimmerdeep subareas sheet](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Glimmerdeep_Mire_Subareas_and_POIs.md) notes the pick clinking when near hidden crystals.

## Cultural Tie
Delvers gift this pick to recruits who survive their first shift without dropping a lamp. Its grip wrap uses knotwork seen in the [Glimmerdeep mire travel notes](../../02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/Zone_Overview.md), linking it to local crews.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic mining tool that doubles crystal node yield and powers glow-lamps in dark delves. Adds bonus perception in [Seamrider routes](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md) and improves Engineering checks when repairing mine carts.
