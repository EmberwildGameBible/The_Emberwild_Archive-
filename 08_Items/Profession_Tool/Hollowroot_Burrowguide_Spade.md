# Hollowroot Burrowguide Spade

## Origin/Provenance
Shaped from peat-hardened wood and braced with bronze, first issued to scouts mapping the Warren collapse. An archaeology note in the [Hollowroot event template](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Events.md) lists this spade as preventing a tunnel slide during a relic pull.

## Cultural Tie
Burrowguides paint clan marks along the handle, and pass it down when a new dig leader is chosen. The design follows patterns from the [Hollowroot gear themes](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B107%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20Gear%20%26%20Loot%20Themes%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), blending surface lodge style with bog craft.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic spade that avoids collapse in soft loam and quickly maps tunnel depth. Adds Archaeology and Cartography bonuses during [Hollowroot exploration](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md) and reduces time to extract buried caches.
