# Greatwood Greenwarden Satchel

## Origin/Provenance
Sewn from waxed canvas salvaged off old survey tents and lined with briar bark panels. A marginal note in the [Greatwood ingredient taxonomy](../../GameBible/Future/Features/51%20%E2%80%93%20Greatwood%20Ingredient%20Taxonomy.md) lists the satchel as the pack that carried the first frostmint haul to Lodge Crossing.

## Cultural Tie
Herbalists in Greatwood decorate these bags with pressed leaves from their first successful gather. The cinch patterns mimic those shown in the [Professions & Gathering primer](../../GameBible/Future/Features/B108%20%E2%80%93%20Professions%20&%20Gathering%20(Greatwood%201%E2%80%9320).md), making it a rite-of-passage kit.

## Gameplay Hook
Epic gathering bag that prevents wither on rare herbs and keeps reagents fresh for longer crafts. Grants a bonus node yield when used in [Greatwood travel segments](../../02_Regions/Zone_Template/Template_Travel.md) and improves alchemy success rates.
