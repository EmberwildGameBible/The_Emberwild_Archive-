# Items & Ingredients Structure (Expanded)

This folder now contains additional helper views for ingredients:

- `Recipes/EMBERWILD COOKBOOK - INGREDIENTS.md` — canonical, full ingredient list.
- `Ingredients_By_Type/` — grouped views by broad ingredient type:
  - `Fruits.md`
  - `Vegetables.md`
  - `Meats.md`
  - `Fish.md`
  - `Herbs_And_Flowers.md`
  - `Spices_And_Seasoning.md`
  - `Other_And_Special.md`
- `Ingredients_By_Rarity.md` — quick overview of ingredients by rarity.

These views are generated from the main cookbook but do not replace it.
