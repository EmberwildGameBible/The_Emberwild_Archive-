# COOKBOOK EXCERPT — “Fisherman’s Broth”

*A practical Shattercoast recipe, no lore-poetry.*

Ingredients:

- fish scraps
- clean water
- salt
- two potatoes
- one onion
- pepper if you have it
- a handful of sea greens (rinsed twice)

Directions:

Boil everything in one pot.

If the broth turns cloudy too fast, it’s going bad.

If it smells sweet, throw it out.

If your pot rattles on its own, reduce heat — stove’s too hot.

Good enough to feed six.

Better on cold mornings.

Worse on storm days.
