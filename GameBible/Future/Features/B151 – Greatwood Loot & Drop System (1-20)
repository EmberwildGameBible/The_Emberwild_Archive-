## Greatwood 1–20

---

## 0. Purpose & Scope

This file defines how loot **actually enters the game** for the Greatwood 1–20 band:

- How ingredients from `51 – Greatwood Ingredient Taxonomy` are obtained.
- How recipes from `52–53 – Greatwood Cooking` are supported by real drops.
- How specialty ingredients from `55 – Specialty Ingredients` are attached to Hunts, bosses, and events.
- How alchemy reagents from `58 – Intro Alchemy` show up.
- How coin, gear, trophies, and world drops are distributed.

This is a **design-level spec** for:

- Creature loot tables
- Chests, containers, and profession nodes
- World drops and rare items
- Hunts, dungeons, and events

Implementation details (actual numeric tuning, item IDs, and scripts) live in Lua modules:

- `LootTables_Creatures_Greatwood.lua`
- `LootTables_Containers_Greatwood.lua`
- `LootTables_Nodes_Greatwood.lua`
- `LootTables_Special_Greatwood.lua`

---

## 1. Design Pillars

Loot in Emberwild is:

- **Slow** – deliberate, Classic-WoW-adjacent pacing.
- **Rewarding** – drops matter; you can remember when you got them.
- **Meaningful** – even common loot has a clear use (ingredients, food, brews, crafts).
- **Grounded** – mobs drop what makes sense (meat, organs, glands, bones).
- **Predictable-but-exciting** – you know roughly what to expect, but there are rare spikes.

Hard rules:

1. No “loot confetti” spray.
2. Most enemies have **one or two meaningful drops**, not 10 junk items.
3. Most things you loot are either:
   - Immediately useful (food, ingredients, reagents, coin), or
   - Stepping stones to something clearly better (trophies, specialties, rare materials).

---

## 2. Loot Sources Overview

For Greatwood 1–20 we standardize on these loot source types:

1. **Creatures**
   - Ambient wildlife (deer, boar, wolves, fowl, critters).
   - Region creatures (Ashen beasts, Hollowroot monsters, shadow/ward creatures).
   - Humanoids / bandits where applicable.

2. **Hunts & Bosses**
   - Signature Hunts (Elder Stag, Ward-Bear, Hollowroot Matron, Black-Sap Devourer, Howler, Ragged King, Shadow Under Wardstone).
   - Dungeon bosses / mini-bosses.

3. **Profession Nodes**
   - Foraging nodes: herbs, mushrooms, roots, berries.
   - Fishing nodes: river, Ashstream, special weather-based spots.
   - Wood / trophy nodes: carcasses, antler caches, stump caches.

4. **Containers & Chests**
   - Camp chests, lodge caches, ruin chests, dungeon coffers.

5. **Events**
   - Emberfall ash rain.
   - Thunderstorm rivers.
   - Wardstone surges.
   - Hollowroot invasions.

All of them feed the same **loot pipeline**, but with different buckets and weights.

---

## 3. Rarity Tiers & Drop Buckets

We define **loot rarity tiers** as internal tags, not UI colors (those are layered later):

- `COMMON`
- `UNCOMMON`
- `RARE`
- `VERY_RARE`
- `ULTRA` (very rare / unique)

Each loot table has:

1. **Guaranteed** bucket
   - Things that always drop (or nearly always).
   - Example: 1x meat or 1x trivial ingredient; small coin floor.

2. **Primary Roll** (Core Table)
   - The main roll for that creature/type.
   - 0–2 items, usually from ingredient or coin buckets.

3. **Bonus Roll(s)**
   - Low-chance extra items: specialties, trophies, rare reagents, world drops.

4. **World Drop Roll (Optional)**
   - Very low-chance access into the **global relic / rare** list (B143 etc.).
   - Only on specific creature tiers or sources (e.g. bosses, dangerous elites).

We express each table as:

- `guaranteed` items (0+)
- `rolls` list (each with weight, items, and quantities)
- `bonus_rolls` list (optional, rarity hooks)
- `world_drop_chance` (optional, extremely low)

---

## 4. Global Loot Rules (Greatwood 1–20)

1. **Minimum Value Rule**
   - Any non-trivial combat kill (not critters) gives **some** value:
     - At least small coin OR a scrap ingredient.
   - Critters may drop nothing or only cosmetic fluff.

2. **Coin Distribution**
   - Coin is:
     - Modest on ambient wildlife.
     - Higher on humanoids, bandits, and chests.
   - Most animals give coin as a **separate roll**, not in place of ingredients.

3. **Ingredient Coverage**
   - Every ingredient listed in `51 – Greatwood Ingredient Taxonomy` appears in:
     - At least one **primary drop source** (mob or node).
     - Optionally secondary sources (events, containers).

4. **Specialty Ingredients**
   - All `spec_ingr_*` items from 55 only drop from:
     - Their named Hunts/bosses/events.
   - They never appear in generic tables.

5. **Bad Luck Protection**
   - For specialty and key rare reagents:
     - Use soft pity timers (e.g. after N kills, chance ramps).
   - Implementation detail lives in code; this doc says **where** it applies.

6. **Profession Hooks**
   - Many loot tables produce:
     - Raw ingredients that **only become valuable** when passed to Cook/Alchemist/Forager.
   - Hunter’s butchery tools (54) modify:
     - Yield counts and chance for better meat cuts and specialties.

---

## 5. Ingredient Distribution (High-Level Map)

This table maps **ingredient families** from 51 to their **primary sources**.

> This is not exhaustive; it’s the design “who owns what” map.

---

## 6. Loot Table Schema (Implementation-Oriented)

All loot tables are expressed as Lua tables with a consistent shape.

### 6.1 Base Schema

```lua
-- Example generic schema; concrete examples follow later.
LootTables_Creatures["gw_creature_id"] = {
    level_range = { min = 3, max = 8 },       -- for scaling, optional
    coin = { min = 0, max = 5, chance = 0.60 }, -- independent coin roll

    guaranteed = {
        -- items that almost always drop
        { item = "deer_meat_raw",  min = 1, max = 1, chance = 1.0 },
    },

    rolls = {
        -- primary loot roll buckets
        {
            name = "ingredient_core",
            rolls = 1,                    -- how many picks from this bucket
            entries = {
                { item = "deer_meat_raw",    weight = 60, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "stringy_game_meat",weight = 30, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "bone_shard_small", weight = 10, min = 1, max = 1 },
            }
        },
        {
            name = "secondary",
            rolls = 1,
            entries = {
                { item = "simple_herb_bundle", weight = 40, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "mossy_tongue",       weight = 20, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "nothing",            weight = 40, min = 0, max = 0 },
            }
        }
    },

    bonus_rolls = {
        {
            name = "specialty",
            chance = 0.05,  -- 5% chance to roll this bucket once
            entries = {
                { item = "spec_ingr_elder_stag_marrow", weight = 1, min = 1, max = 1 },
            }
        }
    },

    world_drop = {
        chance = 0.001,    -- 0.1% chance per kill
        table  = "WORLD_UNCOMMON_GW",
    }
}
Containers and nodes use the same conceptual structure with a few variations (no coin, more rolls per open, etc.).

7. Creature Loot Families (Greatwood 1–20)
Below are the family templates used for Greatwood creatures. Individual mobs use these as base and then override specifics.

7.1 Deer & Young Stag
Typical mobs: gw_deer, gw_young_stag.

Used to feed:

deer_meat_raw, young_stag_cut

Early stews and roasts from 52.

Loot behavior:

Guaranteed: 1x meat (scaled by Hunter butchery).

Core roll: chance for extra meat, bone shards, simple herbs.

Bonus: tiny chance at antler pieces and, in rare cases, sapstained_antler from certain spawn clusters.

Example:

lua
Copy code
LootTables_Creatures["gw_deer"] = {
    coin = { min = 0, max = 3, chance = 0.35 },

    guaranteed = {
        { item = "deer_meat_raw", min = 1, max = 1, chance = 1.0 },
    },

    rolls = {
        {
            name = "extra_meat_or_bone",
            rolls = 1,
            entries = {
                { item = "deer_meat_raw",      weight = 50, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "stringy_game_meat",  weight = 25, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "bone_shard_small",   weight = 15, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "nothing",            weight = 10, min = 0, max = 0 },
            }
        },
        {
            name = "herb_scraps",
            rolls = 1,
            entries = {
                { item = "simple_herb_bundle", weight = 30, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "mossy_tongue",       weight = 20, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "nothing",            weight = 50, min = 0, max = 0 },
            }
        }
    },

    bonus_rolls = {
        {
            name = "antler_bits",
            chance = 0.06,
            entries = {
                { item = "antler_fragment",        weight = 9, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "sapstained_antler",      weight = 1, min = 1, max = 1 },
            }
        }
    },

    world_drop = {
        chance = 0.0005,
        table  = "WORLD_UNCOMMON_GW",
    }
}
Young stags are similar but with slightly higher chance of antler fragments and lean toward young_stag_cut instead of stringy_game_meat.

7.2 Boar
Mobs: gw_boar, gw_ember_tusk_boar.

Drops:

boar_meat_raw, rendered_boar_fat (via processing), tusks, scraps.

Key use:

Everyday stews, roasts, early Lodge cooking.

Loot:

Guaranteed: 1x boar_meat_raw.

Core: extra meat/fat chance, tusks.

Specialty: boar boss may drop a rare tusk trophy.

7.3 Wolves, Dire Wolves, Greatwood Howler Family
Mobs: gw_wolf, gw_dire_wolf, gw_greatwood_howler.

Simplified example for a dire wolf:

lua
Copy code
LootTables_Creatures["gw_dire_wolf"] = {
    coin = { min = 0, max = 4, chance = 0.35 },

    guaranteed = {
        { item = "dire_wolf_flank", min = 1, max = 1, chance = 1.0 },
    },

    rolls = {
        {
            name = "wolf_bits",
            rolls = 1,
            entries = {
                { item = "lean_wolf_flank", weight = 40, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "dire_wolf_flank", weight = 30, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "wolf_pelt_strip", weight = 20, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "nothing",         weight = 10, min = 0, max = 0 },
            }
        }
    },

    bonus_rolls = {
        {
            name = "howler_trophy_fragments",
            chance = 0.02,
            entries = {
                { item = "wolf_fang", weight = 9, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "howler_alpha_fang", weight = 1, min = 1, max = 1 },
            }
        }
    },

    world_drop = {
        chance = 0.0005,
        table  = "WORLD_UNCOMMON_GW",
    }
}
The Greatwood Howler (Hunt boss) uses a separate boss loot table (see section 8).

9. Containers & Chests
Containers use a simpler schema:

lua
Copy code
LootTables_Containers["gw_ruin_chest_t1"] = {
    coin = { min = 5, max = 20, chance = 1.0 },

    rolls = {
        {
            name = "consumables",
            rolls = 1,
            entries = {
                { item = "food_hunters_jerky",       weight = 35, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "food_simple_forest_fowl_roast", weight = 25, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "brew_bitterpine_stamina_draught", weight = 20, min = 1, max = 1 },
                { item = "nothing",                 weight = 20, min = 0, max = 0 },
            }
        },
        {
            name = "mats",
            rolls = 1,
            entries = {
                { item = "simple_herb_bundle", weight = 30, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "ground_barley_flour", weight = 20, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "greatwood_walnut",    weight = 20, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "nothing",             weight = 30, min = 0, max = 0 },
            }
        }
    },

    world_drop = {
        chance = 0.002, -- better than regular mobs
        table  = "WORLD_UNCOMMON_GW",
    }
}
Types of containers:

Camp Chests – bandit camps, hunter camps; mostly coin, rations, basic mats.

Ruin Chests – ruins, caves; more likely to hold brews, recipes, relic fragments.

Dungeon Coffers – end-of-wing chests; high chance of gear, brews, ingredients in bulk.

Lodge Caches – rewards from Lodge projects and events; often profession-specific items.

10. Profession Nodes & Gathering Drops
Nodes are responsible for most herbs, mushrooms, and some roots. They also push profession fantasy.

10.1 Herb Patch Nodes
Node IDs: node_herb_forest_basic, node_herb_wardstone, etc.

Example:

lua
Copy code
LootTables_Nodes["node_herb_wardstone"] = {
    rolls = {
        {
            name = "herbs",
            rolls = 2,
            entries = {
                { item = "whisperfern",         weight = 35, min = 1, max = 2 },
                { item = "bitterpine_needle",   weight = 30, min = 1, max = 3 },
                { item = "simple_herb_bundle",  weight = 25, min = 1, max = 3 },
                { item = "wardstone_bracket",   weight = 10, min = 1, max = 1 },
            }
        }
    },

    bonus_rolls = {
        {
            name = "rare",
            chance = 0.05,
            entries = {
                { item = "wardstone_crust_flake", weight = 1, min = 1, max = 1 },
            }
        }
    }
}
Forager tools (54) modify:

rolls count.

Chance of rare entries.

10.2 Mushroom Nodes
Node IDs: node_mushroom_forest, node_mushroom_hollowroot.

Drop:

Common caps, glowcap, embertruffle, etc.

Hollowroot variant nodes are where:

spec_ingr_hollowroot_mire_sludge can also be collected during events.

10.3 Root & Tuber Nodes
Node IDs: node_root_clearing, node_root_riverbank.

11. World Drop Tables (Greatwood)
World drop tables are small curated lists that can be rolled by multiple sources.

Example:

lua
Copy code
WORLD_UNCOMMON_GW = {
    entries = {
        { item = "recipe_scroll_hunters_bone_broth",  weight = 5 },
        { item = "recipe_scroll_gw_game_stew",        weight = 5 },
        { item = "alchemy_note_whisperfern_draught",  weight = 5 },
        { item = "trinket_hunters_token_minor",       weight = 3 },
        { item = "trinket_warded_charm_cracked",      weight = 2 },
    }
}
Used by:

Certain mobs (low chance).

Chests (slightly higher).

Bosses (highest chance, plus access to rarer tables later).

Later tables (e.g. WORLD_RARE_GW) can hold:

Early relic fragments (B143).

Unique trinkets with small, flavorful bonuses.

Very rare cosmetic items.

12. Progression & Tuning Notes
1–10 band

Emphasis:

Basic meats, roots, and herbs.

Few specialties (most locked behind 10+ Hunts).

Drop rates:

Higher for basic ingredients, rarer for “weird” stuff.

Goal:

Players quickly understand:

Deer = meat, wolves = meat + fangs, nodes = herbs/mushrooms.

10–20 band

Emphasis:

Specialty ingredients from Hunts and events.

Hollowroot, Ashen, ward reagents.

Drop rates:

Tightened for base ingredients (you now know what you’re doing).

Specialty items show up in consistent but non-trivial quantities.

Goal:

Encourage players to engage Hunts, dungeons, Lodge projects, and profession roles.

Bad Luck Protection Boundaries

For each specialty ingredient from 55:

Document a recommended “soft pity” range:

e.g. spec_ingr_ashen_beast_ember_core: ramp chance after 5 Ashen boss kills.

This data can live in a side table:

13. Summary
This file defines how everything we’ve designed actually drops for Greatwood 1–20:

Creature families → meat, hides, bones, herbs.

Hunts and bosses → specialty ingredients, trophies, and rare mats.

Nodes → herbs, mushrooms, roots, berries, and ward reagents.

Events → special items like Storm-Caught fish, Emberfall ash, Fog-Bloom clusters.

Containers → curated bundles of food, brews, mats, and occasional rare scrolls/trinkets.

World drop tables → small, flavorful spice of recipes and minor trinkets.

It connects directly to:

51 (what ingredients exist),

52–53 (what you cook),

55 (why Hunts matter),

58 (what you brew),

54 (who gets better loot via tools),

57 (what big Lodge projects you can build with that loot).
