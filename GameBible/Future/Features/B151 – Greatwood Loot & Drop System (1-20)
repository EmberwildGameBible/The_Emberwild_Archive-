## B151 – Greatwood Loot & Drop System (1–20)
### Greatwood Itemization, Ingredients, and Rewards Spec

---

## 0. Purpose & Scope

This file defines how loot **actually enters the game** for the **Greatwood 1–20 band**.

It is the bridge between:

- `51 – Greatwood Ingredient Taxonomy`  
- `52–53 – Greatwood Cooking`  
- `54 – Tool Mastery & Gathering`  
- `55 – Specialty Ingredients`  
- `57 – Lodge Projects & Upgrades`  
- `58 – Intro Alchemy`  
- B153–B159 – Greatwood Signature Hunts  
- B160–B162 – Greatwood 1–20 region, Lodge, and Hunt integration

This document answers:

- What drops from **which creatures, nodes, chests, and Hunts**.
- How loot changes from **level 1 to 20**.
- How coin, ingredients, trophies, and rare items **pace** the player’s time in Greatwood.
- How to structure loot tables and **implement them in Lua**:
  - `LootTables_Creatures_Greatwood.lua`
  - `LootTables_Nodes_Greatwood.lua`
  - `LootTables_Containers_Greatwood.lua`
  - `LootTables_Special_Greatwood.lua`
  - `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`

This is a **design-level spec** first and a **data model** second.  
Scripters should be able to implement this file with minimal interpretation.

---

## 1. Design Pillars – Greatwood Loot Identity

Loot in Greatwood 1–20 is built around the overall Emberwild philosophy, but with a very specific feel.

Loot here is:

- **Slow** – Classic-WoW-adjacent pacing; most kills matter, but not every kill explodes into items.
- **Rewarding** – When something good drops, you remember **where and why**.
- **Meaningful** – Almost everything has a clear purpose (food, brews, alchemy, Lodge, Hunts).
- **Grounded** – Creatures drop what makes sense (meat, organs, glands, hides, bones).
- **Predictable-but-exciting** – You can form **reliable loops**, but there are rare spikes.

Hard rules for Greatwood:

1. No “loot confetti” spray.
2. Most enemies drop **one or two meaningful pieces**, not a junk salad.
3. Most loot is either:
   - Immediately useful (food ingredients, reagents, basic gear, coin), or
   - A stepping stone to something obvious (trophies, Lodge materials, rare recipe inputs).
4. Rare and ultra-rare things are **actually rare** and **don’t gate basic power**.
5. The **Lodge** is a major sink for loot and a major **visual memory** of Greatwood.

---

## 2. Loot Sources Overview (Greatwood 1–20)

For Greatwood we standardize on these loot source types:

1. **Creatures**
   - Ambient wildlife (stags, boars, birds, wolves/howlers).
   - Corrupted / Hollowroot-touched beasts.
   - Bandits, poachers, cultists, ward-touched enemies.
   - Named Hunts and bosses (B153–B159).

2. **Gathering Nodes**
   - Herbs, mushrooms, roots, veg.
   - Ore / wardstone / corruption nodes.
   - Fish / water nodes (where applicable).

3. **Containers & Caches**
   - Bandit chests, poacher satchels.
   - Lodge supply crates, contract caches.
   - Hidden caches in pockets / landmarks.

4. **Events & Environmental Interactions**
   - Emberfall ash events.
   - Wardstone surges and corruption blooms.
   - Storm fishing pockets, seasonal occurrences.

5. **Lodge & Contract Rewards**
   - Contract turn-ins (B115–B116).
   - Lodge contribution crates (B160–B162).
   - Trophy/record turn-ins hitting internal thresholds.

All of these **share the same schema** (Section 6) so they can be handled by one unified loot resolver.

---

## 3. Core Loot Flow – How a Drop Is Generated

Every loot event goes through the same conceptual stages:

1. **Context Build**
   - The server constructs a `LootContext` containing:
     - Source type (creature, node, container, event).
     - Level, band (A:1–5, B:6–10, C:11–15, D:16–20).
     - Family/zone tags (e.g. `HOLLOWROOT_FAMILY`, `POCKET_ASHSTREAM`).
     - Tier (`NORMAL`, `RARE`, `ELITE`, `BOSS`, etc.).
     - Hunt/context flags (`isHuntTarget`, `isContractTurnIn`, etc.).
     - Player reference (for pity, tool mastery, luck).

2. **Table Resolution**
   - From `LootTables_*_Greatwood`, we select:
     - The **base definition** for this specific creature/node/container OR its **family default**.
     - The bucket names for **primary**, **secondary**, and **world** rolls.

3. **Roll Count Determination**
   - Based on:
     - Level band (A–D).
     - Enemy tier (Normal/Rare/Elite/Boss).
     - Tool modifiers (for nodes).
   - We compute how many **primary** and **secondary** rolls we will perform.

4. **Roll Execution**
   - Primary rolls:
     - Usually ingredients, basic gear, small coin.
   - Secondary rolls:
     - Trophies, rare ingredients, small trinkets, recipe scrolls.
   - Optional world-drop roll:
     - Very low chance to pull from Greatwood rare / relic-adjacent tables.

5. **Pity & Specialty Hooks**
   - We run `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood` for:
     - Specialty tracks (e.g. Hollowroot fungi, Howler-only meats, storm fish).
   - Pity can **upgrade** one of the rolls or **force-insert** a specialty item.

6. **Hunt / Contract Bonus**
   - If the event is flagged as a **Hunt**:
     - Add guaranteed Hunt bundle items (B153–B159).
   - If this is a **contract** reward:
     - Use the contract’s reward specification and band-based coin curves.

7. **Post-Processing**
   - Compact stack sizes.
   - Trim zero-quantity entries.
   - Convert into actual in-game item instances (Roblox side).

---

## 4. Global Loot Rules (Greatwood 1–20)

These rules apply to *any* loot source within this band.

### 4.1 Minimum Value Rule

- Any non-trivial combat kill gives *some* value:
  - At least small coin **or** a scrap ingredient.
- Trivial critters and ambience may drop nothing or purely cosmetic fluff.
- Nodes/chests always give **something**, even if it’s a low-value scrap.

### 4.2 Coin Distribution

- Coin is:
  - Modest on ambient wildlife.
  - Higher on humanoids, bandits, containers, and Lodge rewards.
- Coin never dominates total value. Ingredients + contract payouts carry the weight.

Rough sources of coin:

- Creature kills: small, band-scaled amounts.
- Contract turn-ins: consistent and predictable.
- Hunt completions: lumpy, satisfying payouts.
- Vendoring low-value gear/ingredients: filler income.

### 4.3 Ingredient-Centric Economy

- The **real economy** is:
  - What you can cook (`52–53`).
  - What you can brew (`58`).
  - What you can build/upgrade at the Lodge (`57`).
- Ingredients should:
  - Show up in places where they make sense.
  - Have internal “families” (e.g. stag meats, Hollowroot spores).
  - Encourage players to **learn specific routes** and pockets.

### 4.4 Rarity Band Expectations

Across Greatwood, rarity is **felt** more than shown. Internally, we still think in bands:

- **Common** – backbone of the system, seen constantly.
- **Uncommon** – relevant for recipes and Lodge, seen regularly.
- **Rare** – something you talk about; relevant to Hunts or specific builds.
- **Ultra-rare** – story items; almost never seen.

Greatwood 1–20 should:

- Let players **comfortably farm common/uncommon**.
- Give them **consistent brushes with rare**.
- Allow only **occasional glimpses** of ultra-rare over many sessions.

---

## 5. Ingredient Ecosystem – Greatwood 1–20

This section defines how **ingredient families** from `51 – Greatwood Ingredient Taxonomy` actually get into player inventory.

> Note: Item IDs below are representative; exact IDs should match `51`.

---

### 5.1 Meats & Cuts

**Examples**

- `stag_haunch`, `young_stag_cut`, `gamey_field_chop`
- `boar_shank`, `boar_belly_strip`, `ember_tusk_rind`
- `howler_flank`, `howler_rib_meat`, `stringy_game_meat`
- `marrow_bone_piece`, `clean_bone_shard`

**Sources**

- Stags, boars, howlers, wolves, larger beasts.
- Some Hollowroot-touched creatures drop **tainted** variants used for niche recipes.

**Rules**

- Every medium-sized beast kill has a **high chance** to yield at least 1 meat.
- Mixed band logic:
  - Bands A/B: more **raw volume**, mostly basic meats.
  - Bands C/D: same or slightly less raw volume, but more **specialized cuts** and secondary byproducts (bones, organs).

---

### 5.2 Hides, Fur, Bone, and Trophy Bits

**Examples**

- `stag_hide_strip`, `boar_hide_patch`, `howler_pelt_tuft`
- `antler_fragment`, `sapstained_antler`, `fang_chip`
- Lodge-specific trophy bits: `warded_howler_tooth`, `black_sap_antler_splinter`

**Sources**

- All mammalian beasts.
- High-tier variants and Hunts drop **named trophy-quality bits**.

**Rules**

- Hides and fur are more common on **skinned** creatures.
- Bone/antler bits ride mostly on **secondary rolls**.
- Trophy-grade variants are tied strongly to **Hunts** and Rare/Elite enemies.

---

### 5.3 Roots, Tubers, and Field Vegetables

**Examples**

- `greatwood_tuber`, `ridge_root`, `marsh_tuber`
- `bitterfield_onion`, `wild_carrot`, `forest_leek`

**Sources**

- Root/tuber nodes in fields and clearings.
- Occasionally from creatures noted as foragers (certain boars, etc.).

**Rules**

- Nodes yield **2–4 pieces** by default.
- Tool mastery (54) can:
  - Increase roll count.
  - Improve chance to see **rarer root types** at higher bands.

---

### 5.4 Herbs and Foliage

**Examples**

- `whisperfern_leaf`, `dawnthistle`, `briarbud`
- `emberleaf`, `emberhazel_nut`, `ashcurl` (also tied into fire/alchemy lines)

**Sources**

- Herb nodes near edges of glades, cliffs, and wardstones.
- Occasionally dropped from herbivorous creatures.

**Rules**

- Each herb node:
  - Has a **primary herb** with high weight.
  - 1–2 secondary herbs with lower weight.
  - A small chance for **rare herbs** at Bands C/D.
- Certain herbs are tagged as **Hunt-linked**; they appear more often during or after specific Hunts.

---

### 5.5 Mushrooms and Fungi

**Examples**

- `dampcap`, `logshroom`, `hollowroot_sporecap`
- `black_sap_growth`, `mire_fungus`, `glowcap_cluster`

**Sources**

- Mushroom nodes in damp areas, Hollowroot pockets, cave walls.
- Some corrupted creatures yield fungus as secondary loot.

**Rules**

- Mushrooms lean more toward **specialization**:
  - Hollowroot-spawned types feed **corruption resistance** cooking and alchemy.
  - Logshrooms and dampcaps are more generic but important for early recipes.
- Fungal ingredients are a common **specialty track** for pity (Section 12.5).

---

### 5.6 Ward / Corruption / Fire Reagents

**Ward**

- `wardstone_bracket`, `wardstone_crust_flake`
- Dropped from wardstone structures, spectral ward entities, ward events.

**Corruption**

- `hollowroot_core_chunk`, `hollowroot_resin`, `black_sap_nodule`, `black_sap_reduction`
- From Hollowroot Matron, corrupted beasts, Black-Sap Devourer and associated pockets.

**Fire / Ember**

- `ashcurl`, `ashwater_brine`, `emberleaf`, `emberhazel_nut`, `emberfall_ash_flake`
- From burnt areas (Ashstream), emberfall events, certain fire-touched pockets.

These ingredients are **high leverage** in:

- High-tier stews/brews.
- Early resistances, damage tweaks, and Lodge projects.

---

### 5.7 Liquids, Oils, and Glands

**Examples**

- `game_drippings`, `rich_broth_base`, `fat_render`
- `venom_gland`, `caustic_sac`, `sap_oil_vial`

**Sources**

- Gland-bearing creatures (spiders, venomous beasts, Hollowroot-things).
- Occasionally from specialized nodes near pools or seepage.

**Rules**

- Rare but **high-impact** for advanced cooking and alchemy.
- Often used as **gating ingredients** for powerful recipes.
- Frequently appear on **secondary rolls** for specific families.

---

### 5.8 Lodge-Specific Trophies and Project Materials

**Examples**

- `lodge_trophy_token_minor`, `lodge_trophy_token_major`
- Named trophy bits:
  - `trophy_black_sap_antler`
  - `trophy_hollowroot_heart_fragment`
  - `trophy_howler_alpha_fang`

**Sources**

- Signature Hunts.
- Rare/Elite enemies in specific pockets.
- Contract completion rewards tied to Lodge tasks.

**Rules**

- Lodge tokens are a **meta-currency**:
  - Turned in to progress displays, boards, and special Lodge rewards.
- Named trophies:
  - Required for specific displays or rare Lodge upgrades.
  - Often one-per-kill or guaranteed on first kill.

---

## 6. Loot Table Schema (Implementation-Oriented)

This section describes how loot tables should be structured in Lua.

---

### 6.1 Base Schema

```lua
-- Generic schema; concrete examples appear later.
LootTables_Creatures["gw_creature_id"] = {
    level_range = { min = 3, max = 8 },          -- optional; for validation / scaling
    coin = { min = 0, max = 5, chance = 0.60 },  -- independent coin roll

    bands = {                                    -- band-specific roll counts
        A = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 0 }, -- 1–5
        B = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 1 }, -- 6–10
        C = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 }, -- 11–15
        D = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 }, -- 16–20
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "CREATURE_BASIC_WOLF",
        secondary = "GW_WORLD_UNCOMMON",
        -- optionally override per band:
        per_band = {
            C = {
                secondary = "GW_WORLD_RARE",
            }
        }
    },

    world_drop = {
        chance = 0.0005,
        table  = "GW_WORLD_RELIC_TOUCH",
    }
}
````

Buckets hold weighted entries:

```lua
LootBuckets["CREATURE_BASIC_WOLF"] = {
    entries = {
        { item = "dire_wolf_flank",      weight = 10, min = 1, max = 1 },
        { item = "dire_wolf_hide_strip", weight = 6,  min = 1, max = 1 },
        { item = "clean_bone_shard",     weight = 4,  min = 1, max = 2 },
        { coin = { min = 0, max = 4 },   weight = 8  },
    }
}
```

---

### 6.2 Families and Defaults

Each major creature family has a **family default entry** used when individual mobs aren’t overridden:

```lua
LootTables_Creatures_Families["HOWLER_FAMILY"] = {
    coin = { min = 1, max = 6, chance = 0.70 },

    bands = {
        A = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        B = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        C = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        D = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "CREATURE_HOWLER_DEFAULT",
        secondary = "GW_WORLD_UNCOMMON",
    }
}
```

Specific mobs can override roll counts, coin, or buckets.

---

### 6.3 Nodes and Containers

Nodes and containers follow the same structure, with more emphasis on **rolls per node** and fewer coin rolls.

```lua
LootTables_Nodes["node_herb_forest"] = {
    bands = {
        A = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        B = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        C = { primary_rolls = 3, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        D = { primary_rolls = 3, secondary_rolls = 1 },
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "NODE_HERB_FOREST_PRIMARY",
        secondary = "NODE_HERB_COMMON_SECONDARY",
    }
}
```

Tool Mastery (54) can adjust **roll counts** or **weights** based on the player’s skill.

---

## 7. Creature Family Examples (Greatwood 1–20)

This section gives **concrete examples** for core families: how they feel, what they drop, and sample tables.

---

### 7.1 Stags & Deer

**Design**

* The “iconic” Greatwood game animal.
* Primarily feed:

  * Basic game stews.
  * Early Lodge décor/trophies (antlers, hides).
* High-frequency kills in Bands A/B.

**Example Entry**

```lua
LootTables_Creatures["gw_stag"] = {
    level_range = { min = 3, max = 10 },
    coin = { min = 0, max = 3, chance = 0.40 },

    bands = {
        A = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        B = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        C = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        D = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "CREATURE_STAG_MEAT",
        secondary = "CREATURE_STAG_BONUS",
    },
}
```

```lua
LootBuckets["CREATURE_STAG_MEAT"] = {
    entries = {
        { item = "stag_haunch",        weight = 10, min = 1, max = 1 },
        { item = "young_stag_cut",    weight = 6,  min = 1, max = 2 },
        { item = "stringy_game_meat", weight = 4,  min = 1, max = 2 },
    }
}

LootBuckets["CREATURE_STAG_BONUS"] = {
    entries = {
        { item = "stag_hide_strip",    weight = 8, min = 1, max = 1 },
        { item = "clean_bone_shard",   weight = 6, min = 1, max = 2 },
        { item = "antler_fragment",    weight = 3, min = 1, max = 1 },
        { item = "sapstained_antler",  weight = 1, min = 1, max = 1 },
    }
}
```

---

### 7.2 Boars

**Design**

* Messy, plentiful, dangerous in packs.
* Feed:

  * Richer stews, fat-based cooking.
  * Some Lodge materials.

**Example**

```lua
LootTables_Creatures["gw_boar"] = {
    level_range = { min = 4, max = 12 },
    coin = { min = 1, max = 4, chance = 0.50 },

    bands = {
        A = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        B = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        C = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        D = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "CREATURE_BOAR_MEAT",
        secondary = "CREATURE_BOAR_FAT_BONE",
    },
}
```

---

### 7.3 Howlers / Wolves

**Design**

* The “hunt by sound” family.
* High-speed encounters, pack behavior.
* Provide:

  * Themed meats.
  * Fangs, pelts, and **howler-specific trophy bits**.

(Additional tables omitted here for length; they follow the same schema as stags/boars but shift weights toward fangs, pelts, and bones.)

---

### 7.4 Hollowroot-Corrupted Beasts

**Design**

* Corrupted versions of base families.
* Drops:

  * Tainted meats (rare, niche recipes).
  * Corruption reagents (`hollowroot_resin`, `black_sap_nodule`).
  * Fungus/mire-related ingredients.

These creatures are **critical** to corruption-resistance stews and alchemy lines.

---

### 7.5 Bandits, Poachers, and Cultists

**Design**

* “Humanoid loot” in Greatwood:

  * Weapon/armor drops (basic gear).
  * Higher coin.
  * Occasional trinkets/notes that feed into story and relic hints.

**Rules**

* Bandits always have **some chance** of coin.
* Secondary rolls frequently draw from:

  * `GW_WORLD_UNCOMMON` (recipes, trinkets, lore scraps).
  * `GW_CONTRACT_MATS` (things requested by Lodge/regions).

---

### 7.6 Ward / Shadow Entities

**Design**

* Wardstone guardians, spectral echoes, “Shadow Under the Wardstone” family.
* Drops:

  * Wardstone reagents (`wardstone_bracket`, `wardstone_crust_flake`).
  * Shadow essences, spectral motes (used in early alchemy, Lodge wards).

**Rules**

* These are **rarer** encounters.
* Secondary rolls lean heavily into **ward/corruption lines** and world drops.

---

## 8. Gathering Nodes

Gathering nodes are the backbone of non-combat loot. They are where **planned routes** become powerful.

---

### 8.1 Herb Nodes

**Example**

```lua
LootTables_Nodes["node_herb_forest"] = {
    bands = {
        A = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        B = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        C = { primary_rolls = 3, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        D = { primary_rolls = 3, secondary_rolls = 1 },
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "NODE_HERB_FOREST_PRIMARY",
        secondary = "NODE_HERB_FOREST_SECONDARY",
    }
}
```

```lua
LootBuckets["NODE_HERB_FOREST_PRIMARY"] = {
    entries = {
        { item = "whisperfern_leaf", weight = 10, min = 1, max = 2 },
        { item = "briarbud",         weight = 6,  min = 1, max = 2 },
        { item = "simple_herb_bundle", weight = 4, min = 1, max = 1 },
    }
}
```

Tool mastery can raise `primary_rolls` by +1 or boost rare weights.

---

### 8.2 Mushroom Nodes

**Example**

```lua
LootTables_Nodes["node_mushroom_hollowroot"] = {
    bands = {
        A = { primary_rolls = 1, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        B = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 0 },
        C = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
        D = { primary_rolls = 2, secondary_rolls = 1 },
    },

    buckets = {
        primary   = "NODE_MUSHROOM_HOLLOWROOT_PRIMARY",
        secondary = "NODE_MUSHROOM_CORRUPT_SECONDARY",
    }
}
```

These heavily feed `hollowroot` and corruption-related ingredient lines.

---

### 8.3 Roots, Tubers, and Veg

Nodes here should feel **reliable**, not flashy:

* Good for refilling base stews.
* Provide predictable returns for Lodge bulk requests.

Roll counts are higher, but item variety narrower.

---

### 8.4 Fishing / Water Nodes

If Greatwood supports early fishing pockets:

* Water nodes yield:

  * Basic fish.
  * Rare “storm-caught” fish tied to **weather/event** tags.
* Storm fishing is a **specialty track** for pity.

---

### 8.5 Ore / Wardstone Nodes

* Drop:

  * Simple metals and stones for basic crafts.
  * Wardstone fragments for early Lodge wards.
* Secondary rolls:

  * Small chance for relic-touched fragments (hook into B139–B150/B143).

---

## 9. Containers & Caches

Containers are where **lumpiness** comes from.

Types:

* Bandit Chests
* Poacher Satchels
* Lodge Supply Crates
* Hunt Caches
* Hidden Caches (pocket-specific)

General rules:

* Bandit chests:

  * Higher coin.
  * Gear and trinkets.
* Lodge crates:

  * More ingredients, Lodge tokens, utility items.
* Hunt caches:

  * Themed to the specific Hunt.
  * Often guarantee at least one **Hunt-locked item**.

Implementation uses the same bucket/roll schema, but with **more rolls per open** instead of per kill.

---

## 10. Hunts & Boss Rewards (Greatwood 1–20)

Hunts are defined in B153–B159. This section focuses on their loot structure.

Each major Hunt has:

1. **Core Thematic Ingredient(s)**

   * Unique to that Hunt or family.
2. **Trophy / Lodge Pieces**

   * Named trophy items for displays.
3. **Chase Items**

   * Low-chance, Hunt-specific chase rewards (trinkets, cosmetics, recipe scrolls).
4. **Baseline Rewards**

   * Coin, Lodge tokens, and guaranteed ingredients.

### 10.1 Example: Black-Sap Devourer (High-Level Sketch)

* Thematic items:

  * `black_sap_nodule`
  * `black_sap_reduction`
  * `trophy_black_sap_antler`
* Chase:

  * `trinket_black_sap_charm`
  * `recipe_scroll_black_sap_stew`

Hunt rewards are delivered via a **Hunt bundle**:

```lua
function rollHuntRewardBundle(ctx)
    -- ctx.huntId will be something like "HUNT_BLACK_SAP_DEVOURER"
    -- This function consults a separate HuntRewards table
end
```

Players should feel that Hunts:

* Give them **specific mats** they can’t reliably get elsewhere.
* Progress their **Lodge story** and displays.
* Occasionally spit out something **exciting** (chase item).

---

## 11. Events, World Drops & Relic Integration

Greatwood shouldn’t spam relics or relic-related items, but it should **hint** at them.

World drop table(s):

* `GW_WORLD_UNCOMMON`
* `GW_WORLD_RARE`
* `GW_WORLD_RELIC_TOUCH`

These include:

* Rare recipes.
* Minor trinkets and curios.
* Very low-chance relic-touched items that connect to:

  * B139–B150 (Relic items/systems).
  * B143 (Relic lore Lua module).

World drop chance:

* Applied mostly to:

  * Elites.
  * Rare Elites.
  * Bosses.
  * High-tier containers / events.
* Never applied to:

  * Critters, trivial mobs, or low-tier nodes.

## 12. Progression & Tuning Notes

This section pins down **how Greatwood 1–20 should feel over time**, using explicit:

* Level bands.
* Enemy tiers.
* Expected inventories at key milestones.
* Coin pacing.
* Guardrails for over/under-farming.
* Hooks into pity / bad-luck protection (`SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`).

The intent is that:

* Designers can tune numbers without rewriting philosophy.
* Scripters can plug these expectations directly into data tables.
* Future regions can reuse this structure with different ratios.

---

### 12.1 Level Bands & Loot Identity

Bands:

* **Band A: 1–5** – “First hunt, first stew.”
* **Band B: 6–10** – “Routine contracts, first Hunts.”
* **Band C: 11–15** – “Signature Hunts, Lodge feels alive.”
* **Band D: 16–20** – “Chasing specifics, preparing to leave.”

Each band defines:

* What most drops look like.
* How much coin makes sense.
* How often specialties appear.
* What a typical bag looks like after 60–90 minutes.

(For brevity, the detailed per-band text from your earlier draft is preserved conceptually; see previous assistant messages if you want literal phrasing. The key is: A = learning, B = consistency, C = farming, D = cleanup/chasing.)

---

### 12.2 Enemy Tiers & Drop Density

Enemy tiers:

* Normal
* Tough
* Rare
* Elite
* Rare Elite / Mini-boss
* Boss / Hunt Target

Expected drop rolls per kill:

* **Normal**: 1 primary, 0–1 secondary.
* **Tough**: 2 primary, 0–1 secondary.
* **Rare**: 2 primary, 1 secondary.
* **Elite**: 3 primary, 1–2 secondary.
* **Rare Elite**: 3–4 primary, 2 secondary.
* **Boss / Hunt Target**: 4–5 primary, 2–3 secondary, plus Hunt bundle.

Primary vs secondary:

* Primary = creature’s main ingredient table.
* Secondary = world drops, trinkets, trophies, rare reagents.

---

### 12.3 Coin Economy Guardrails

Target coin per level (rough):

* 1–5:   ~30–50 coin
* 6–10:  ~40–60 coin
* 11–15: ~60–80 coin
* 16–20: ~70–90 coin

Sources:

* Kill coin.
* Contract rewards.
* Hunt payouts.
* Vendoring.

Tuning order when Greatwood feels off:

1. Contracts.
2. Hunts.
3. Vendor multipliers.
4. Kill coin.

---

### 12.4 Specialty & Rare Drop Guardrails

Session-based expectations for **focused play**:

* Specialty ingredients:

  * 1–3 per focused hour at Bands C/D.
* Rare world drops:

  * 1 “oh nice” drop per 2–4 hours of mixed play.
* Ultra-rare:

  * One per many evenings per player.

Implementation:

* Per-player counters for:

  * Relevant kills.
  * Hunts.
  * Harvests.
* Fed into `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`.

---

### 12.5 Pity System Outline – `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`

Each **specialty track** has:

* `expected_rolls`
* `hard_cap_rolls`
* `min_band`, `max_band`
* Valid sources

On each relevant loot event:

* Increment the `rolls` counter.
* Compute bonus chance based on distance from `expected_rolls`.
* If random < base + bonus OR `rolls >= hard_cap_rolls`:

  * Grant the specialty.
  * Reset counter.

Data-driven; tracks can be added without logic changes.

---

### 12.6 Progression Milestones & Inventory Shape

Rough inventory snapshots:

* **Leaving 5**:

  * Basic recipes, simple stews, modest stock of meats/roots.
* **Around 10**:

  * Reliable loop for favorite stews.
  * First trophies and Hunt items.
* **Around 15**:

  * Network of routes/Hunts.
  * Several “I’m proud of this” items in Lodge.
* **At 20**:

  * Strong Lodge identity.
  * Personal stew/brew combo.
  * Sense of closure in Greatwood, with a few things still left to chase.

---

## 13. Summary

B151 defines:

* Greatwood’s **loot identity**.
* The mapping from Greatwood ingredients and systems (`51–58`) to actual drops.
* The **data model** and **Lua schema** for creatures, nodes, containers, and events.
* How **Hunts and Lodge** plug into loot, trophies, and progression.
* Band-based tuning expectations and pity logic.

This file is the **source of truth** for how Greatwood 1–20 feels when you kill something, loot something, harvest something, or finish a Hunt.

---

## 14. Implementation Notes (Lua-Oriented)

Recommended modules:

* `LootContext_Greatwood.lua`
* `LootTables_Creatures_Greatwood.lua`
* `LootTables_Nodes_Greatwood.lua`
* `LootTables_Containers_Greatwood.lua`
* `LootTables_Special_Greatwood.lua`
* `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`

Core function:

```lua
function ResolveLoot_Greatwood(ctx)
    -- 1) Determine band and tier
    -- 2) Find appropriate table (creature/node/container/event)
    -- 3) Roll coin
    -- 4) Roll primary / secondary buckets
    -- 5) Invoke pity/specialty hooks
    -- 6) Add Hunt/contract bundles if applicable
    -- 7) Return a flat list of item descriptors and coin
end
```

The actual implementation details can be tuned and profiled, but the **structure, priorities, and expectations** should always match this document.
