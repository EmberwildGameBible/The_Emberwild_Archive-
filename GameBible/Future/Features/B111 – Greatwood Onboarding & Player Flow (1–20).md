# B111 – Greatwood Onboarding & Player Flow (1–20)
Purpose

Define how the player actually experiences all the stuff we’ve built in Greatwood 1–20:

What systems unlock when and why.

How we teach:

Hunts & the Lodge (59, 61, B103)

Corruption & Warding (91, B101)

Alchemy & Professions (58, B108)

Lodge Projects, Events & Social (B102, B104, B105)

Gear, Quarters & Identity (B107, B106, B100)

Combat roles & builds (B110)

The goal is no system dump on the player; instead:

A smooth ramp from “lost newcomer in the woods” → “recognizable hunter with a defined role and Lodge identity” by level 20.

This file describes flow & staging, not moment-to-moment quest text.

Design Pillars

Funnel First, Fan Out Later

Early Greatwood is linear-ish:

Introduce core verbs one by one (track, fight, rest, report).

Mid/late Greatwood opens:

Multiple contract types.

Circle choices.

System depth (Alchemy, Professions, Projects).

Teach Through Doing, Not Pop-Ups

Minimal “wall of text” tutorials.

Instead:

Short, clear tasks.

NPC guidance.

Hunts that require using the thing we just taught.

Repeated Light Touches

Every major system is:

Introduced once.

Reinforced 2–3 times.

Then folded into the general flow.

The player isn’t expected to “get” everything on first exposure.

Role & Identity by Level 20

By the end of Greatwood:

Player should know:

“I lean Huntmaster/Warden/Scholar.”

“I’m more Striker / Frontliner / Controller / Hybrid.”

The Lodge should visibly reflect their path.

Corruption & Lodge as “The Spine”

The main throughline of Greatwood 1–20 is:

Corruption rising & being managed.

The Lodge growing.

Everything else plugs into that.

High-Level Phase Structure

We break Greatwood 1–20 into four phases:

Phase I: Arrival & Initiation (Levels ~1–4)

Phase II: The Working Hunter (Levels ~5–9)

Phase III: Corruption & Circles (Levels ~10–15)

Phase IV: Signature Threats & Vigil (Levels ~16–20)

Each phase has:

Primary goals.

Systems introduced or deepened.

Signature content set-pieces.

Lodge state changes.

Phase I – Arrival & Initiation (Levels ~1–4)

“You are nobody yet. Learn to survive, earn your place.”

Key Goals

Establish:

The Lodge as home base.

Basic Hunt loop: accept → track → kill/observe → return.

Warm-up combat & status basics.

Very light introductions of:

Corruption (just as a scary word).

Alchemy (bandages & simplest brew).

Grant title:

“Guest of the Lodge” → “Pledged Hunter” (B105).

Systems Introduced

Hunt Board (basic contracts) – 61, 59

Basic gear & loot – B107 (starter Ridgewood)

Simple food + rest buffs – 58 (cooking side)

Early professions:

Herbalist: simple herbs.

Trapper: basic skinning.

Lodge as rest hub (no projects yet).

HP damage, BLEED & simple status effects – B109.

Flow Beats
1. First Impressions: Outside the Lodge

Representative of each circle (Huntmaster/Warden/Scholar) in short cameos.

Player status:

Officially “Guest of the Lodge.”

Limited access:

No personal quarters yet.

Restricted interactions.

3. First Hunts (Tutorial Contracts)

Sequence of 2–3 basic Hunts:

Simple “go kill a beast near Lodge” contract.

Teaches:

Reading a basic trail.

Finishing a target.

Rewards:

Slightly improved starter weapon (Ridgewood knife/axe).

Small gold.

Hunt #2 – “Follow the Tracks”

Introduces:

Tracking more explicitly:

Highlighted footsteps.

Claw marks.

Maybe:

Minor BLEED from enemy.

Teaches:

Basic bandage use.

Hunt #3 – “Bring it Back Alive (or Close Enough)”

Observation-focused:

Maybe an observe-only deer or low-tier beast.

Teaches:

The idea of non-lethal objectives.

Field Scribe prompt (soft Field Scribe intro).

After completing this small arc:

Lodge Proper promotes player to:

Pledged Hunter.

Formal introduction to the Hunt Board UI as an ongoing feature.

4. First Taste of Alchemy & Professions

Back at Lodge:

Short interaction with:

Fringe Alchemist.

Medic.

They request:

Simple herb (Paleleaf) → Herbalist node highlight on a “near Lodge” side trip.

Simple beast pelt → Trapper interact on next Hunt’s corpse.

At Alchemy table:

Player crafts:

1 basic healing brew or buff.

At Infirmary / training:

Medic uses those materials to demo bandages / balms.

Keep it tiny: 1–2 recipes, nothing fancy yet.

Phase II – The Working Hunter (Levels ~5–9)

“You’re in the rotation. The Lodge starts relying on you. The world opens slightly.”

Key Goals

Turn the player into a routine hunter:

Regular contract loop.

Exploration of Greatwood pockets.

Introduce:

Contracts variety (culls, escorts, research, supply).

Professions as ongoing side activity (B108).

First Lodge Project (B102) and sense of Lodge improvement.

Basic social & circle reputation dynamics (59, B105).

Unlock:

Personal Quarters Tier 1 (B100, B106) via project F1 “Carve Out Hunter Quarters.”

Systems Deepened

Alchemy:

3–5 core brews:

Healing, stamina/regen, simple cleanse, buff.

Lodge Projects:

Intro projects:

Simple infrastructure / services.

Social:

Circle rep numbers become visible.

First minor epithets possible late in phase.

Flow Beats
1. “You’re On the Board Now”

After Pledged:

Hunt Board opens fully (still limited to Tier 0–1 contracts).

Player picks:

A mix of Hunts:

Standard beasts.

One or two early corruption-adjacent hints (maybe ZCL 1 zone but mostly atmospherics).

After a few Hunts:

NPCs start referencing:

Player being seen as a proper hunter.

Light Lodge gossip.

2. Professions as Natural Side Loops

New contracts show:

Explicit material needs:

“Gather timber to repair a storage shed.”

“Herbs for infirmary.”

On the way to Hunts:

Nodes appear:

Timber, herbs, beast carcasses.

Tutorials:

Micro-prompts only once:

“You can harvest this…”

After that, it’s just part of the environment.

3. First Lodge Projects (B102 Tier 0/1)

Introduce 1–2 starter projects:

“Patch the East Roof” (Infrastructure)

Requirements:

Timber from Forester.

Small material contribution from player’s early profits.

Outcome:

Visible roof change.

Minor rest buff improvement near that wing.

Narrative:

NPCs mention “no more drips.”

“Carve Out Hunter Quarters” (Personal Spaces) – F1

Requires:

Some timber/hides.

Minimal gold.

On completion:

Unlock Tier 1 Personal Quarters (B100/B106).

Player gets:

Starter bed & decor slots (Rough Straw Cot + a default shelf item).

This should feel like:

A tangible reward for just doing a string of Hunts and basic contributions.

4. Quarter & Identity Lite

When Tier 1 quarters unlock:

Short scene:

Lodge steward walks you to your door.

Simple customization prompt:

Choose bed style (if options exist).

Place 1 shelf item (e.g., Hunt tags or a returned trinket).

This also softly introduces:

The idea of trophies (though the big ones come in later phases).

5. Early Social Signals (B105)

As player does more contracts:

Circle reps start to diverge a bit.

NPC lines:

Begin referencing:

“You spend a lot of time with the Huntmasters / Wardens / Scholars.”

End of Phase II:

Player should have:

Clearer sense of which circle they lean toward.

But no hard lock yet.

Phase III – Corruption & Circles (Levels ~10–15)

“You’re not just killing beasts anymore; you’re holding the line.”

Key Goals

Make Corruption an active, understood threat (91).

Bring Warding Wing & Labs online (B101).

Unlock:

More Lodge Projects including defense, research, and personal upgrades (B102).

More advanced Alchemy (58) & research tasks.

Events: Ward-Tuning Nights, early Infirmary Rushes, mini social events (B104).

Introduce first Signature Hunts (B103), at least the Howler and Ragged King.

Formalize:

Circle reputation as a meaningful choice (59, B105).

Upgrade:

Personal Quarters Tier 2 if F2 project is done.

Systems Deepened

Corruption pockets with mid ZCL.

Wardstone and ward map.

Labs & Research Gallery (B101).

Circle rep thresholds unlocking:

Gear.

Contracts.

Dialogue branches.

Flow Beats
1. “Something’s Wrong Out There”

Story event:

Corruption begins to spike in one named pocket (Black Sap Grove or Hollowroot Fringe).

Player is called:

To speak with Warden of Wards and Scholar contacts.

Warding Hall & Labs:

Unlock as accessible spaces (still partially locked behind specific projects).

Corruption taught via:

A guided corruption Hunts:

ZCL 2 pocket.

Player sees HCL/HCL UI for the first time (91, B109).

Basic explanation:

“Stay here too long → your mind pays for it.”

2. Warding Wing & Labs (B101)

Off of that event:

Player is brought into:

Warding Hall:

Ward map UI, showing corruption pockets.

Labs:

A simple research interface.

They complete:

One very simple research project:

E.g., “Analyze samples from this pocket.”

One simple warding project:

“Reinforce a minor wardstone near Lodge.”

This concretely introduces:

Warding & research as ongoing systems linked to Hunts.

3. Signature Hunts Begin (B103)

At this stage:

First Signature Hunts unlock as special contracts, likely:

“The Greatwood Howler”

Introduced as:

The first big apex challenge.

The Lodge uses:

This Hunt as a checkpoint:

After success/failure, get different narrative.

“The Ragged King”

Maybe slightly later or parallel:

Encounter can appear anywhere in the mid-band.

Offers:

Role-defining choice:

Observe vs kill vs brutal.

Signature Hunts:

Drive:

Big lore.

Big trophies.

Big gear unlocks.

And push combat roles:

Striker vs more cautious/merciful identity vs support.

4. Circle Reputation & Gear (B107, B105)

Mid-Greatwood is where circle aligns start to matter:

At certain rep thresholds (Rank 1–2 per circle):

Unlock:

Circle epithets.

Circle-flavored gear:

Huntmasters: Hunter’s Ridge + advanced Ridgewood.

Wardens: early Wardens’ Guard pieces, ward-etched weapons.

Scholars: Scholar’s field garb, prototypes.

We don’t hard-lock content, but:

The player sees:

Very obvious circle-flavored rewards in vendors, contracts, and dialogue.

5. Lodge Projects & Events Ramp Up (B102, B104)

More project types appear:

Infrastructure & Services:

Infirmary expansion.

Training yard.

Defense & Warding:

Restore wardstones.

Extend wards to outer pockets.

Research & Archives:

Ember Gallery opening.

Codex vault expansions.

Personal Spaces F2:

“Upgrade Hunter Quarters” to Tier 2 (more slots + utility slot).

Events:

Micro Events:

Trophy hanging.

Medic lecture.

Dice games.

Lodge Events:

Hunt Reckoning after first Signature Hunt.

Ward-Tuning Night when some pockets hit certain ZCL.

Infirmary Rush after a particularly nasty corruption arc or mass failures.

Player should feel:

“Things are happening when I come back to the Lodge now, and my actions change which events I see.”

6. Personal Quarters Tier 2 (B100, B106)

When F2 project completes:

Player’s room:

Expands or improves visually.

Gains new slots:

Second wall trophy.

Second shelf.

Floor Utility slot.

This is also a natural point to:

Encourage the player to place their first Signature Hunt trophy (Howler skull / Ragged King item).

Choose a utility piece:

Personal stash chest.

Hunt planning stand.

Meditation mat, etc.

This turns quarters into a strong identity anchor heading into end of Greatwood.

Phase IV – Signature Threats & Vigil (Levels ~16–20)

“You are no longer the new hunter. You’re one of the ones holding Greatwood together.”

Key Goals

Resolve:

Greatwood’s major Signature Hunts (B103).

At least one major corruption threat.

Flow Beats
1. Solidifying Corruption Arc (91, B101, B102)

Narrative step:

Corruption in multiple pockets is escalating:

Black Sap Grove.

Hollowroot Fringe/ Warren.

Player must:

Choose where to focus:

Warding projects vs offense vs research.

Gameplay:

More corruption Hunts.

More Warding projects:

Extend wards to Hollowroot Fringe.

Stabilize Black Sap boundaries.

Increased ambient signs:

More corrupted encounters.

NPC worry.

2. The Remaining Signature Hunts (B103)

Bring in the rest of the B103 pack:

Black-Sap Devourer

Corruption-heavy lair fight.

Teaches advanced corruption & environmental management.

Hollowroot Matron

Dungeon-style lair in Hollowroot Warren.

Multi-phase, reinforces poison/spores & group fight logic.

Shadow Under the Wardstone

Humanoid/ideological threat:

Player choice on how to resolve (combat vs arrest vs cover-up).

Order is flexible:

Ideally Devourer before Matron, but can be tuned by story.

Each Signature Hunt completed:

Updates:

Lodge trophies & presence.

Bestiary & labs.

ZCL in relevant pockets (temporary relief).

Feeds into:

Circle rep.

Social epithets (merciful/ruthless, cautious/reckless, Lodge-Faithful/Fringe).

3. Ember Feast (B104)

After:

1–2 Signature Hunts.

A major Lodge project milestone (e.g., common room refit, Feast project).

Special Feast food buffs.

Story circles recounting:

Player’s Hunts (including signature ones).

Social:

Strong Lodge Proper rep opportunities.

Some circle-flavored interactions.

This is the social / “we’re still alive” climax of Greatwood.

4. Gloaming Vigil (B104 + 91)

When:

ZCL across pockets is high enough.

Or story dictates a major Corruption surge.

Trigger:

The Gloaming Vigil:

Several nights of high tension.

Ward map flares up.

Watchposts, Vigil contracts, rituals.

Player:

Chooses how deeply to engage:

Patrol watchposts.

Deliver reagents.

Participate in rituals.

Outcome of Vigil:

Based on:

How many tasks are done.

Which pockets were addressed earlier.

Determines:

Final corruption state of Greatwood.

Survival/condition of some named NPCs.

Longer-term rep with Wardens & Scholars.

This is the corruption & Warden climax.

5. Final Lodge Status & Titles (B105)

Exit State: Leaving Greatwood (Post-20)

When the player leaves Greatwood for the next region, we want them to feel:

Mechanically:

Comfortable with:

Hunts & contracts.

Basic corruption mechanics.

Brews & professions at a basic/adept level.

Reading gear & statuses.

Socially & Narratively:

Tied into:

One primary circle + at least one secondary.

Lodge identity (they care what happens to this place).

Recognized by:

A formal title.

At least one epithet.

Rumors reflecting their big choices (Ragged King, Shadow, etc).

Visually / Identity-wise:

Wearing:

A coherent gear combo from:

Ridgewood / Hollowroot / Ward-etched / Black Sap / Scholar families.

Quarter:

Decorated with:

1–2 Signature Hunt trophies.

Circle tokens.

Event memorabilia (Feast/Vigil).

Profession/alchemy curios if they leaned into those.

Role-wise (B110):

Clearly leaning toward:

Huntmaster Striker.

Warden Frontliner.

Scholar Controller.

Corruption-Edge Hunter.

Versatile Woodsman.

The next region can then pick up that identity and evolve it rather than re-teach the basics.
