# 90 – Secrets, Caches, and Exploration Rewards (Greatwood 1–20)

## Purpose

Define how **secrets, hidden caches, and exploration rewards** work in Greatwood:

- What kinds of secrets exist (hidden paths, stashes, puzzles)
- What players get for exploring thoroughly
- How secrets tie into:
  - Map & regions (63)
  - Hunts, Deeds, and events (61, 62, 66)
  - Professions and recipes (52–59, 78, 85)
  - Game Bible entries and lore (69)

Goal: reward **curious, observant players** so the forest feels layered and worth re-walking.

---

## Design Goals

1. **No empty exploration**
   - If a player goes off the main path, there should be a decent chance of:
     - A cache.
     - A vista.
     - A lore note.
     - A rare spawn.

2. **Small secrets, not just giant puzzles**
   - Lots of micro-secrets:
     - Hidden chests.
     - Ingredient-rich pockets.
   - Occasional bigger secrets:
     - Multi-step puzzles.
     - Rare encounter chains.

3. **Systems-connected rewards**
   - Secrets feed:
     - Professions.
     - Recipes.
     - Deeds.
     - Trophies.

4. **Teach the player that “looking closer” matters**
   - Visual cues.
   - Audio hints.
   - Codex entries explaining the idea of caches.

## Reward Philosophy

   - Minor decor items for future housing/rooms.
   - Tied into Trophy/achievements system (86).

5. **Lore**
   - Codex entries.
   - Tiny story snippets about past hunts, Lodge history, vanished hunters.

## Difficulty & Rarity

  - Small caches, minor hidden trails.
  - Frequent enough to be a normal part of exploration.

- Uncommon secrets:
  - Require following a hint chain or noticing multiple cues.
  - Better rewards (recipes, rare ingredients).

- Rare “meta-secrets”:
  - Multi-step across different subregions {63}.
  - Possibly require:
    - Specific weather/time.
    - Certain Deeds completed.

## Integration With Other Systems

- **Hunts & Deeds (61, 66):**
  - Some Deeds:
    - Directly involve searching for caches.
  - Hunts:
    - Might send you to areas with higher secret density.

- **Tracking & Fieldcraft (67, 80):**
  - Signs may double as hints not just for animals, but for human-made stashes:
    - “Boot prints that end at a rock face” → hidden door or stash.

- **Camps & Traps (77, 79):**
  - Secret “perfect camp spots”:
    - Natural defensibility.
    - Nearby resource clusters.

- **Professions (52–59, 78, 85):**
  - Some profession rank-ups:
    - Require finding special caches (old journals, lost tools).

- **Achievements & Trophies (86):**
  - Exploration category achievements:
    - X caches found.
    - All secret vistas discovered.
    - Specific rare event triggered.
