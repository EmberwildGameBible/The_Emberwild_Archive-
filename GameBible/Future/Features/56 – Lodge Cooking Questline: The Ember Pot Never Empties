# 56 – Lodge Cooking Questline: “The Ember Pot Never Empties”

## Premise

The Lodge’s heart is its great communal stew: the **Ember Pot**.  
It is said to never run dry as long as hunters keep returning from the wilds.

This questline turns Cooking from “just a profession” into a **story**, where the player:

- Helps keep the Ember Pot alive
- Learns key recipes (52, 53, 55)
- Builds a relationship with the Lodge cook(s)
- Unlocks advanced cooking tools and a signature final dish

---

## Tone & Themes

- Homecoming, community, and the cost of keeping people fed
- Small, grounded tasks that gradually reveal bigger pressures:
  - supply shortages
  - corruption in ingredients
  - pressure from Lodge leadership

---

## Structure Overview

Quest chain length: **4–6 quests**, scaling roughly with Cooking skill from 1 to 20.

Proposed quest names (working):

1. **“A Pot for All”** – Intro / Basic gathering and first recipes
2. **“Short on Meat, Long on Stories”** – Hunt and supply quest
3. **“Bitter Broth”** – Tainted/strange ingredients, first corruption hint
4. **“Flavor of the Forest”** – Specialty ingredients and signature dishes
5. **“Ash in the Pot”** – Crisis: Ember Pot is threatened (wildfire, corruption, sabotage)
