# 87 – Lodge Hounds, Animal Companions, and Non-Mount Followers (Future System Stub)

## Purpose

Define a **future-capable system** for:

- Lodge hounds and other small animal companions
- How they function as **non-mount followers** (scouts, trackers, helpers)
- How they tie into:
  - Tracking & fieldcraft (67)
  - Hunts & Deeds (61, 66, 79, 80)
  - Lodge identity and social layer (64, 83)
  - Talents / growth (82)

Goal: make animal companions feel like **real working partners**, not generic pets, and make sure the system is expandable but can start very small in Greatwood 1–20.

---

## Core Concept

Lodge hounds and similar companions are:

- Trained animals used by the Lodge for:
  - Scent tracking
  - Guarding camps
  - Flushing out prey
  - Emotional support and morale
- Initially, this is a **limited, opt-in system**:
  - You aren’t required to have a companion.
  - You can choose to work with one if you invest in the right content.

Future expansions can broaden:

- More species.
- More specialized roles.
- Deeper bonding/behavior systems.

---

## Companion Types (Greatwood 1–20 Scope)

### 1. Lodge Hounds (Core)

Baseline working dog companions, with variants:

- **Tracker Hound** – scent-focused.
- **Guard Hound** – camp/station defense.
- **Runner Hound** (later) – messenger / fast movement flavored.

### 2. (Optional Future) Small Birds of Prey

- **Scout Falcon** – early stub only:
  - Concept for later: long-range scouting pings.

For now, focus on **hounds** as the primary implemented companion type.

---

## Companions vs Pets

Design intent:

- These are **working animals**, not purely cosmetic pets.
- They:

  - Have clear functional roles.
  - Interact with systems like tracking, camps, and hunts.

- Visually and behaviorally:
  - Loyal, but with animal instinct (they can get scared, injured, or flee).

---

## Basic Companion Behavior

### Idle & Movement

- Companion follows player at a respectful distance.
- Idles by:
  - Sniffing ground, drinking at river’s edge, resting at camp.
- Pathing:
  - Stays mostly behind or beside the player.
  - Avoids getting constantly stuck underfoot.

### Combat Behavior

- Not a full “combat pet class.”
- Hounds:

  - Snap at smaller enemies.
  - Harass or distract.
  - Rarely do large chunks of damage.

Key behaviors:

- **Marking enemies**:
  - Hound growls/barks at enemies behind cover or in fog.
- **Harassment**:
  - Light, opportunistic bites that can:
    - Apply small debuffs (minor slow, slight distraction).
- **Retreat**:
  - If HP drops too low, companion pulls back automatically.

---

## Tracking & Fieldcraft Synergy (67, 80)

### Scent Tracking

Tracker Hound:

- Can “take a scent” from:

  - Fresh tracks.
  - Dropped fur.
  - Bloodstains or a specific item (e.g., trophy piece).

Once on a scent:

- Hound:

  - Moves toward likely trail directions.
  - Periodically sniffs and barks to indicate:

    - “Trail is strong.”
    - “Trail is faint” (risk of losing it).

System behavior:

- Not a perfect GPS.
- Hound can:

  - Lose track in bad weather (81).
  - Circle around in confusion if the trail is too cold.

### Alerting & Warning

- Hound reacts to nearby dangerous creatures:

  - Low growls when something is close but not yet visible.
  - Barking during ambush to give player a tiny reaction edge.

Fieldcraft perks (Path of the Trail, 82):

- May improve:

  - How well the hound follows trails.
  - How early it senses enemies.

---

## Camps & Guarding (77)

Guard Hound variant:

- At camp:

  - Hound can be commanded to “Guard.”
- Effects:

  - Slight reduction in chance of surprise ambush while resting.
  - Warning bark if enemies approach during rest (wakes player).

Integration:

- Camp tiers:

  - Higher-tier camps may have dedicated resting spot for hounds.
- Talents / perks:

  - Could boost guard effectiveness (longer detection radius, fewer ambushes).

---

## Companion Management & Commands

### Basic Commands

Simple radial or key-based commands:

- **Follow** – normal behavior.
- **Stay** – remain in place (useful for stealth or scouting).
- **Guard Here** – camp/position defense posture.
- **Track** – attempt to find or follow target scent/track.

In Greatwood 1–20, keep commands **small but meaningful**.

### Health & Injury

- Hounds have:

  - Basic HP and simple wound states.
- If heavily injured:

  - They retreat and cannot assist until:
    - Rest at Lodge.
    - Or specific balm/food is used (58, 52).

No permanent death in 1–20, but:

- A future “ironman mode” could allow more severe consequences.

---

## Acquisition & Progression

### Getting a Hound

- Questline:

  - “Lodge Hound Bond” (or similar).
  - Introduces:

    - Basic care.
    - Basic commands.
    - Hound’s role in hunts.

- Player:

  - Can name their hound.
  - Choose a visual variant (coat color, minor markings).

### Progression

- Simple bond/experience system:

  - Hound “levels” with:
    - Hunts completed.
    - Tracks followed.
    - Time in the field.

- Perks:

  - Slightly improved:

    - HP and resilience.
    - Tracking capacity.
    - Guard detection range.
  - Cosmetic additions like:
    - Collars, small Lodge tag, etc.

## Social & Lodge Layer (64, 83)

- Lodge:

  - Has hounds present as ambient NPC animals.
  - Hound trainers/keepers:

    - Run small training yard.
    - Comment on your hound’s behavior.

- Festivals:

  - Hounds may:

    - Be decorated with small festival ribbons.
    - Participate in small fetch or “show” moments.

- Politics:

  - Some Lodge members:

    - Favor heavy use of hounds for scouting.
    - Others worry about overworking animals (flavor tension).

---

## UI & Feedback

- Small icon or UI element indicating:

  - Hound’s status (Healthy / Wounded / Resting).
- Visual cues:

  - Hound body language:

    - Tail/stiff posture when alert.
    - Relaxed at camp or Lodge.

- Codex/Game Bible entries (69):

  - Hound breeds, training traditions, notable famous Lodge hounds.

---

## Integration With Other Systems

- **Tracking & Traps (67, 79):**
  - Hounds help guide towards track clusters.
  - May bark at traps that have been triggered or disturbed.

- **Weather & Hazards (81):**
  - Hounds may:

    - Dislike heavy storms (seek shelter).
    - Be more effective in clear weather.

- **Talents (82):**
  - Path of the Trail / Lodge talents may:
    - Enhance companion utility.
    - Reduce cost or improve care.

- **Hunts & Deeds (61, 66):**
  - Some Deeds:

    - Explicitly encourage or require using a hound for scent trails.

---

## Next Actions

- Decide:

  - If hounds are in scope for base Greatwood 1–20 or reserved for a later update.
- If in scope:

  - Define one baseline hound type (Tracker) and keep it small.
  - Write:

    - Intro questline outline.
    - Basic command set.
    - First set of behaviors and tuning targets.
- If later:

  - Treat this doc as future feature stub and tag accordingly.
