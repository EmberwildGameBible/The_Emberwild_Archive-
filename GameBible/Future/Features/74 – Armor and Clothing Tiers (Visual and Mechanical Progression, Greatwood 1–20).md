# 74 – Armor & Clothing Tiers: Visual and Mechanical Progression (Greatwood 1–20)

## Purpose

Define **early armor and clothing progression** in Greatwood:

- Visual tiers (how the player looks)
- Mechanical impact (defense, stamina, resistances)
- Profession / Lodge identity gear

This is a design pass for **what armor/clothing sets exist** and how they grow from level 1–20.

---

## Armor / Clothing Pillars

1. **Hunter-first silhouettes**  
   - Cloaks, leather, layered cloth and light metal.
   - No full plate in Greatwood 1–20.

2. **Readable tiers**  
   - You can roughly tell power level by looking:
     - Worn, mismatched gear
     - Cleaned up Lodge set
     - Distinct Greatwood or Hollowroot-themed armor

3. **Weight vs mobility**  
   - Heavier gear = better protection, slightly worse stamina/movement.
   - Lighter gear = more stamina and speed, less raw defense.

4. **Profession flavor gear**  
   - Forester, Cook, Woodworker sets (54, 59) are visible and distinct.

---

## Early Tier Structure (Greatwood 1–20)

Rough tiers:

1. **Tier 0 – Makeshift & Hand-Me-Downs**
2. **Tier 1 – Lodge-Issued Starter Gear**
3. **Tier 2 – Working Hunter Sets**
4. **Tier 3 – Signature Greatwood / Hollowroot Sets**

Each tier can have:

- Light variant
- Medium variant

Heavier armor beyond this is for later regions.

## Integration

  - Food and tonics can compensate for lighter armor choices.
- **Hunts & Deeds (61, 66):**
  - Some hunts reward armor pieces or set components.
- **Lodge Social (64):**
  - Certain festivals or social events might feature:
    - Cosmetic armor variants
    - Cloaks, badges, or sashes.

## Next Actions

- Build an **armor table** for Greatwood:
  - Slots: head, chest, hands, legs, feet, cloak.
  - Tier 0–3 variants and their stats.
- Define:
  - Visual notes for each set.
  - Which quests/Deeds/profession ranks grant which pieces.
- Ensure:
  - All early sets align with the broader visual identity of Emberwild and Greatwood.
