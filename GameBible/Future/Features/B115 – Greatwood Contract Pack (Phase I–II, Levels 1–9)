B115 – Greatwood Contract Pack (Phase I–II, Levels 1–9)
Purpose

Define the early contract lineup for Greatwood, Phases I–II (roughly levels 1–9), so that:

Onboarding (B111) has specific Hunts & tasks to point at.

Pockets & landmarks (B113) are used immediately.

Enemy families (B114) appear in curated, teachy groupings.

Systems like:

Hunts & contracts (59, 61, B103)

Professions (B108)

Alchemy (58)

Projects (B102)

Social & circles (B105)

get early, low-stress exposure.

This does not cover Signature Hunts; those are B103. These are the everyday jobs.

Contract Categories (Phase I–II)

For this band we use:

Tutorial Hunts (Phase I only)

Standard Hunts

Support & Supply Contracts

Research & Observation Tasks

Escort / Protection Contracts

Event-Adjacent Minis (early hooks into B104)

Each contract below should be thought of as a template:

Can be slightly rescaled, remixed, or re-run with variants.

Has:
