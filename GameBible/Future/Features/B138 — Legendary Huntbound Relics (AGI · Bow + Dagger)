B138 — LEGENDARY HUNTBOUND RELICS (AGI · LV 60)
1. Overview

These are your endgame AGI DPS legendaries:

Skyshatter Huntbow — ranged legendary for bow users.

Nightveil Prowler — melee dagger legendary for stealth/rogue-style builds.

They’re meant to:

Sit about 25–30% stronger than a perfect Lv 60 Rare.

Verdant Shrikewolf, Charhound, Frostmaw Lynx, Moonless Stag, etc.

Reward players who engage with apex hunts and rare beasts across all zones.

Questline name: “The Grand Hunt: Skyshatter”

Structure:

Hunt the Old Prey (revisits old apex beasts).

Hunt the Broken Skies (special sky/flight encounters).

Hunt the Final Shadow” (instance / scenario).

Step 1 — Hunt the Old Prey

Objectives:

Slay each of these while tagged with a Hunt Sigil:

Verdant Shrikewolf (Greatwood)

Lavaspine Basilisk (Ashen Ridge)

Frostmaw Lynx (Frostmarch)

Moonless Stag (Duskhollow)

Each kill must be:

With the Huntmaster’s Sigil item in your bags (or off-hand cosmetic).

Within a certain time window after “marking” them (prevents cheesing old kills).

Each kill drops a bound quest item:

Shrikewolf Hunt-Trophy

Lavaspine Hunt-Trophy

Frostmaw Hunt-Trophy

Moonless Hunt-Trophy

Turn in all four to Huntmaster Ralden in your hub.

Reward:

“Skyshatter Bowframe” (incomplete legendary base).

Step 2 — Hunt the Broken Skies

Instance / world events focused on moving targets and positional play.

Objectives:

Ashen Ridge — “The Ember Vulture Flight”

Fight a special flock of Pyre Vultures on cliff edges.

You must land killing blows with ranged attacks while avoiding knock-offs.

Frostmarch — “Aurora’s Prey”

During an aurora event, track and kill a unique aurora-phase predator:

The Star-Fanged Vyraxx.

It phases in and out; only visible while under a special “Aurora Sight” buff.

Duskhollow — “Shadow of the Sky”

An aerial-ish shadow beast, Umbral Roc of Duskhollow, swoops in.

You must dodge line attacks and shoot weak points when it dips.

When all three are done, upgrade:

Skyshatter Bowframe → Skyshatter Heartstring Frame

Reward:

Next quest: “Hunt the Final Shadow.”

Step 3 — Hunt the Final Shadow

Success:

Reward: Skyshatter Huntbow (Legendary).

Frame consumed.
