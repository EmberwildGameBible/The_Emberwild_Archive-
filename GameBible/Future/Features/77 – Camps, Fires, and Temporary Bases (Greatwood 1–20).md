# 77 – Camps, Fires, and Temporary Bases (Greatwood 1–20)

## Purpose

Define the **camp system** for Emberwild in Greatwood 1–20:

- How players set up **temporary bases** in the wild
- What **campfires, bedrolls, and structures** actually do
- How camps tie into:
  - Rest & recovery (70)
  - Combo recipes/structures (57)
  - Professions & social identity (Forester, Cook, Woodworker, Alchemy)
  - Hunts, Deeds, and events (61, 62, 66)

Goal: make camps feel like **real hunter outposts**, not just generic respawn points.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Meaningful but lightweight**  
   Camps are quick to set up, but have **real mechanical value**.

2. **Player choice & risk**  
   Where you camp, when you camp, and how well you set up a camp all matter.

3. **Profession synergy**  
   Foresters, Cooks, Woodworkers, and Alchemists all have ways to improve camps.

4. **Diegetic “save point” fantasy**  
   Camps are where hunters regroup, patch up, eat, and prepare.

---

## Core Camp Elements

A **Camp** is defined by:

1. **Campfire**
2. **Rest spot** (bedroll / sitting space)
3. Optional **structures**:
   - Drying racks, meat racks, blinds, markers, etc. (57)
4. Optional **utility**:
   - Cooking pot
   - Simple crafting spot
   - Small alchemy setup (later tiers)

---

## Campfire

### Basics

- Placed by the player using simple resources:
  - Wood bundles + tinder (Forester wood, basic items).
- Once lit:
  - Creates a small **safe-ish radius**:
    - Slight reduction in random hostile spawns.
    - Some enemies are attracted, others repelled (design choice per enemy family).

### Mechanical Effects

- HP & stamina out-of-combat regen:
  - Enhanced while near a lit campfire.
- Food buffs:
  - Eating near a campfire could:
    - Slightly extend buff duration.
    - Or mildly improve effectiveness (comfort factor).

### Risk / Time

- Lighting takes:
  - A short cast time (few seconds, can be interrupted).
- Fire lasts:
  - For a set in-world duration or until extinguished.
- Extinguish:
  - Player can douse to avoid detection or to move on.

---

## Rest Spots (Bedrolls & Seats)

### Bedroll

- Simple rest object:
  - Player can “Rest” for a time skip + partial recovery.
- Effects:
  - Resting restores:
    - HP / stamina to full.
    - **But not** major death debuffs (those require Lodge or stronger items, 70).
- Risk:
  - Time passes.
  - Chance of random encounter if camp is placed in a risky area (may be reduced by good structures or markers).

### Seats / Stools / Logs

- Light interaction:
  - Short sit animation.
  - Small stamina regen bump.
- Social:
  - Potential small “camp gathering” events if multiple players (future).

---

## Camp Structures (Tied to 57)

Use existing combo concepts but formalize them as “camp upgrades.”

### Examples

1. **Hanging Meat Rack (57)**  
   - Provides:
     - Group food buff station.
     - Mild ongoing buff in camp radius if stocked.

2. **Portable Drying Rack (57)**  
   - Allows converting meat → travel rations over time.

3. **Scent-Masking Bundle (57)**  
   - When burned:
     - Temporarily reduces enemy detection radius around camp.

4. **Baited Blind (57)**  
   - When near camp:
     - Can be used to **pull enemies toward** a camp prepared with traps.

## Camp Tiers

### Tier 1 – Basic Camp

- Components:
  - Simple fire
  - One bedroll
- Effects:
  - HP/stamina regen boost while resting.
  - Limited rest (no major debuff clearing).

### Tier 2 – Lodge Hunter Camp

- Adds:
  - Meat rack or drying rack
  - Slightly better “comfort”
- Effects:
  - Improved regen.
  - Small buff to next hunt after resting (e.g., +2–3% stamina regen for X minutes).
- Requirements:
  - Certain profession items (Cook, Woodworker).
  - Basic Lodge reputation.

### Tier 3 – Greatwood Field Outpost (Late 1–20)

- Adds:
  - More slots for structures (e.g., blind, tracking markers, small alchemy table).
- Effects:
  - Smarter enemy pathing around camp (some avoid light).
  - Slightly safer rest (lower chance of mid-rest attack).
- Requirements:
  - Deeds or profession quest completion.
  - Resources from Hollowroot / Burn-Scars.

---

## Camp Placement Rules

- Camps can only be placed:
  - Outside of Lodge + safe zones.
  - Away from certain POIs (not directly in boss arenas, etc.).
- Soft limits:
  - One active camp per player at a time (old one despawns).
- Placement checks:
  - No overlapping with major scripted events.

---

## Integration With Death & Respawn (70)

- Option: **“Struggle to Safety”** can return player to:
  - Nearest discovered outpost **or**
  - Their last camp if it was sufficiently well-established.
- Death penalty:
  - If respawning at a camp:
    - Slightly higher residual “Shaken” debuff compared to Lodge, or
    - No ability to fully clear debuff via camp.

Goal: camps are helpful but don’t fully replace Lodge.

---

## Integration With Hunts & Deeds (61, 66)

- Long hunts:
  - Encourage setting up a camp in or near the hunting grounds.
- Deeds:
  - Certain steps may explicitly require:
    - Establishing a camp as a “forward base.”
- World bosses:
  - Camps near world boss routes are dangerous but convenient.

---

## Integration With Professions (54, 59, 58)

- **Forester:**
  - Better fuel usage, fires last longer.
  - Additional environmental knowledge for safer placement.

- **Cook:**
  - Better camp cuisine:
    - Bonus to food buffs cooked or eaten at camp.

- **Woodworker:**
  - Crafts advanced camp structures:
    - Better racks, blinds, seats.

- **Alchemy:**
  - Brews and balms:
    - Prep at camp with simple alchemy kit.
    - Tonics that specifically interact with resting (e.g., boosted recovery after a brew + rest).

---

## Events & Ambient Life (62, 64)

- Camps can be visited by:
  - Passing NPC hunters (micro social events).
  - Wildlife sniffing around:
    - Neutral, friendly, or hostile depending on what’s stored or cooked.

- At night:
  - Certain events only trigger if player is:
    - Sitting at a campfire.
    - Resting in a dangerous region.

---

## Next Actions

- Define a **crafting/placement spec**:
  - Resource costs.
  - Time to build.
  - Limits per player.
- Create a **tier table** for camps:
  - Tier, components required, effects.
- Identify:
  - Specific quests/Deeds that introduce camps as a core mechanic.
