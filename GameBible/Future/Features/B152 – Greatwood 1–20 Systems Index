## B152 – GREATWOOD 1–20 SYSTEMS INDEX  
### Vertical Slice Map, Dependencies, and Implementation Checklist

---

## 0. PURPOSE & SCOPE

This file is the **master map for Greatwood 1–20**.

It answers:

- What **systems** exist in Greatwood 1–20.
- Where each system’s **detailed spec** lives (B-files and core chapters).
- How those systems **depend on each other**.
- How to implement Greatwood 1–20 as a **vertical slice** in **phases**, without getting lost.

This is not a lore dump.  
This is an **orchestration document**: a readable, actionable control panel.

---

## 1. GREATWOOD 1–20 – HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW

Greatwood 1–20 is intended to function as a **self-contained first region** that teaches:

- **How Emberwild works** (loot, combat, professions, Lodge).
- **How players make decisions** (routes, Hunts, risk vs reward).
- **How long-term systems feel** in a small space (Relics, Lodge, contracts, Hunts).

Core pillars:

1. **The Lodge** – Home base, identity hub, progression sink.
2. **Contracts** – Structured goals that push players into pockets and Hunts.
3. **Hunts & Major Creatures** – Signature encounters that define Greatwood’s identity.
4. **Loot & Ingredients** – All progression (cooking, Lodge, alchemy) runs on this.
5. **Pockets & Landmarks** – Micro-biomes that teach risk, routing, and “this place is special.”
6. **Professions & Cooking** – First real taste of economic depth and build expression.
7. **Onboarding & Flow** – How we actually get players from Level 1 to leaving Greatwood.

B151 handles **loot**.  
B152 (this file) defines **everything around it** and makes sure it all lines up.

---

## 2. SYSTEM LAYERS & WHERE THEY LIVE

This section is a **map**. It does not re-spec everything; it points to where things are defined and how they connect.

2. **Lodge & Home Base**
3. **Enemy Families & Creatures**
4. **Contracts & Tasks**
5. **Hunts & Major Encounters**

  - Has a **strong sense of closure**, but with a few clear chase items if they want to linger.

---

## 4. SYSTEM DEPENDENCY GRAPH (TEXTUAL)

This section describes dependencies in simple, implementation-useful terms.

---

### 4.1 Hard Dependencies

These are **must-exist-before** relationships.

- **B151 (Loot) depends on:**
  - Enemy families spec.
  - Ingredient taxonomy (`51`).
- **Contracts (B115–B116) depend on:**
  - Pockets layout (B110–B113).
  - Enemy families & nodes (for “go do X there” logic).
- **Hunts (B153–B159) depend on:**
  - Enemy families (for boss variants).
  - Pockets (for their arena/biome).
  - Lodge Hunt Board (for surfacing them).
- **Lodge projects (B162 and core Lodge systems) depend on:**
  - Loot tables (B151).
  - Ingredients & trophies (51–55).
- **Cooking & alchemy (52–53, 58) depend on:**
  - Loot (B151).
  - Ingredient taxonomy (51).

---

### 4.2 Soft Dependencies & Feedback Loops

These are loops that need to **feel good** but do not have strict gated order.

- **Hunts ↔ Lodge**
  - Hunts give trophies/ingredients → Lodge projects unlock board upgrades → Board surfaces harder Hunts.
- **Contracts ↔ Pockets**
  - Contracts send players into pockets → Their ingredients/enemies define future contracts.
- **Loot ↔ Professions**
  - Loot controls ingredient supply → Professions control how ingredients turn into power/value.

---

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES – GREATWOOD VERTICAL SLICE

This is a **practical plan** for actually building Greatwood 1–20 in stages.

---

### PHASE 1 – “SKELETON GREATWOOD”

Goal: **You can walk around, fight, and get basic loot.**

**Must-have pieces**

- Base Greatwood map & pockets (graybox acceptable).
- Enemy families implemented with:
  - Basic AI.
  - Health/damage tuning for 1–20.
- **Minimal loot** wired up from B151:
  - Meat, basic ingredients, small coin.
- An **ugly but functional Lodge**:
  - Spawn, basic vendor, simple contract board stub.

**What works in-game**

- Kill beasts, get meat + coin.
- Turn in **one or two ultra-simple contracts**.
- Cook one or two basic recipes manually (or via placeholder UI).

---

### PHASE 2 – “REAL LOOT & ROUTES”

Goal: **Greatwood feels like a region, not a tech demo.**

**Must-have pieces**

- B151 fully implemented:
  - Creature loot tables.
  - Node loot tables.
  - Basic world drop tables (no relics yet).
- Herb, mushroom, root, and simple ore nodes placed along pockets and routes.
- Several **pocket-specific contracts**:
  - “Cull A family in pocket X.”
  - “Harvest nodes in pocket Y.”

**What works in-game**

- Players can pick up contracts, run **real loops**, and:
  - See consistent ingredient patterns per pocket.
  - See coin/loot roughly match the bands from B151.

---

### PHASE 3 – “HUNTS & LODGE IDENTITY”

Goal: **Greatwood starts to feel iconic.**

**Must-have pieces**

- Implement at least **3 major Hunts** (from B153–B159) end-to-end:
  - Spawn logic.
  - Arena setup.
  - Basic mechanics.
  - Hunt reward bundles (using B151 loot hooks).
- Lodge:
  - Hunt Board functional.
  - Trophy turn-in and display for those Hunts.
- More developed contracts:
  - Prep contracts that feed into those Hunts.

**What works in-game**

- Player can:
  - Hunt named creatures.
  - Bring trophies back to the Lodge.
  - Visibly upgrade Lodge Hunt displays.
- Hunts feel different from normal combat and worth doing.

---

### PHASE 4 – “PROFESSIONS, SPECIALTY, & PITY”

Goal: **Depth kicks in.**

**Must-have pieces**

- Cooking system:
  - Several real recipes wired to ingredients from B151.
  - Effects apply correctly in combat.
- Tool Mastery:
  - Gathering yields modified by skill.
- `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`:
  - Track at least 2–3 specialty tracks (e.g. Hollowroot fungi, storm fish, Hunt-only meats).
- More advanced alchemy:
  - A handful of brews using ward/corruption reagents.

**What works in-game**

- Players can:
  - Plan routes for specific ingredients.
  - Notice that bad streaks on specialty mats get “caught” by pity over time.
  - Feel the Lodge and cooking powering them through Hunts.

---

### PHASE 5 – “FULL GREATWOOD EXPERIENCE”

Goal: **Polish and completeness.**

**Must-have pieces**

- All major Hunts implemented from B153–B159.
- Full Lodge project line for Greatwood (B162):
  - Last visual stages implemented.
- Dynamic events:
  - At least one emberfall / wardstone surge / storm variant integrated with loot.
- Basic Relic teasing:
  - Rare world drops that connect to B139–B150/B143 without over-saturating.

**What works in-game**

- A player can:
  - Live in Greatwood from 1–20.
  - Learn and master its systems.
  - Develop a strong sense of **home**.
  - Move on to the next region with:
    - A crystallized identity.
    - A Lodge that reflects their run.
    - A handful of unique stories.

---

## 6. TELEMETRY & TUNING HOOKS

This section defines **what you should log** to check that Greatwood behaves like B151/B152 say it should.

---

### 6.1 Recommended Metrics

Per player, per session (or per in-game hour):

- **Kills per band** (A/B/C/D).
- **Loot per band**:
  - Count of ingredients by family (meat/herb/fungus/etc.).
  - Coin earned (raw vs contract vs vendoring).
- **Contracts**:
  - Accepted, completed, abandoned.
  - Time to complete.
- **Hunts**:
  - Attempts vs successes.
  - Time per attempt.
  - Damage taken / dealt.
- **Node interactions**:
  - Count per node type.
  - Yield per node, per band, per tool mastery tier.
- **Specialty drops**:
  - Rolls and hits per specialty track.
  - Pity activations.

---

### 6.2 Expected Ranges (Sanity)

From B151:

- Coin/hour roughly:
  - 55–100 at 1–5.
  - 100–160 at 6–10.
  - 150–210 at 11–15.
  - 190–270 at 16–20.

When telemetry says:

- Much higher than this:
  - Check contract rewards and vendor values first.
- Much lower:
  - Check contract availability and drop densities.

For specialty ingredients:

- 1–3 per **focused farm hour** in Bands C/D.
- If logs show:
  - Large numbers of players going 3+ hours of focused content with **zero** specialty hits:
    - Pity config is too stingy.
  - Everyone drowning in specialty mats:
    - Baseline drop rates and/or pity are too generous.

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING GAPS & TODO NOTES

This section is a **living checklist** of things that likely still need expansion or hard decisions.

> (Use checkboxes in your editor/Notion mirror if helpful.)

- [ ] Finalize the list of **Greatwood pockets** and confirm each has:
  - [ ] Enemies.
  - [ ] Nodes.
  - [ ] Contracts.
  - [ ] At least one event hook or reason to revisit.
- [ ] Confirm every **major enemy family** has:
  - [ ] Behavior spec.
  - [ ] Loot bucket spec (linked to B151).
  - [ ] Placement in at least two pockets.
- [ ] Ensure each **Hunt (B153–B159)** is:
  - [ ] Mapped to a pocket / arena.
  - [ ] Wired to a Hunt Board entry.
  - [ ] Wired to a Hunt reward bundle consistent with B151.
- [ ] Finalize the **Greatwood-specific recipe subset**:
  - [ ] Which recipes are realistically obtainable in Greatwood.
  - [ ] Which ones are teaser/preview for later regions.
- [ ] Define at least:
  - [ ] 2–3 **specialty tracks** for `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`.
  - [ ] Their expected roll counts and hard caps.
- [ ] Implement minimal **telemetry hooks** and confirm they log:
  - [ ] Coin/hour.
  - [ ] Ingredients/hour.
  - [ ] Specialty tracks behavior.

---

## 9. SUMMARY

B152 is the **hub** around which all Greatwood 1–20 work orbits.

- It does **not** replace B151 (loot) or the Hunts/Contracts files.
- It makes them **coherent**, so:
  - You can build Greatwood in phases.
  - You can check that it behaves as intended.
  - You can see, at a glance, what’s missing.

If B151 is “what drops where and why,”  
B152 is “how all of that fits together so Greatwood actually feels like a place.”
