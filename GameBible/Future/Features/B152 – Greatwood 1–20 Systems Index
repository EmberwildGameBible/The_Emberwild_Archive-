# B152 – Greatwood 1–20 Systems Index

## Purpose

This file is the **map** for all Greatwood 1–20 systems so you don’t have to remember:

- what “51” vs “54” vs “B151” are,
- which doc talks about ingredients, which talks about loot,
- or where the Hunts / Lodge / professions actually plug into each other.

If you feel lost, **read this first**, then jump into the specific file it points you at.

## 0. High Level: What Greatwood 1–20 Actually Covers

For Greatwood 1–20, the **core gameplay loop** is:

1. Go out from the Lodge into Greatwood.
2. **Hunt, forage, fish, and fight** → bring back ingredients + specialties.
3. **Cook and brew** at the Lodge → food, tonics, feasts.
4. **Use them in Hunts, dungeons, and events** → get rare drops and trophies.
5. **Invest those** into:
   - Lodge upgrades,
   - Profession tools and kits,
   - Trophies and ward rituals,
   - Future regions.

The docs in this index are the spine of that loop.

## 2. Hunt / Contract / Dungeon Docs (B11x–B12x)

    - B151 (their boss loot structure),
    - 57 (their trophies / Lodge projects),
    - 53 / 58 (recipes/brews that use their specialties).

- **Contract / Board docs**:
  - Define tasks like “kill X beasts” or “bring back Y ingredients”.
  - Now connect to:
    - 51 (what can be collected),
    - 54 (tools that make contracts easier),
    - B151 (expected yields / drop frequencies).

## 3. How to Read This Stuff Without Getting Lost

If you’re reviewing or expanding Greatwood 1–20, a clean reading order is:

1. **51 – Ingredient Taxonomy**  
   → know what exists.

2. **52 – Early Cooking**  
   → see what basic food uses those ingredients.

3. **58 – Intro Alchemy**  
   → see what basic brews exist.

4. **54 – Profession Tools & Gear**  
   → understand who does what and how they improve.

5. **55 – Specialty Ingredients**  
   → understand why Hunts and events matter.

6. **53 – Advanced Cooking**  
   → see the “big” Lodge food and feasts.

7. **57 – Profession Combo Projects**  
   → see Lodge upgrades, expeditions, trophies, ward rituals.

8. **B151 – Loot & Drop System**  
   → confirm it all has real sources.

Any time you add something new (new dish, new brew, new Hunt), make sure it:

- Has ingredients in **51**.
- Uses or can use tools in **54**.
- Fits into projects in **57** (if it’s big enough).
- Actually has drops/nodes defined in **B151**.

## 4. Future You / Dev Notes

When you eventually jump back into Roblox / code:

- B151 + 51–58 become the blueprint for:
  - `LootTables_*` modules,
  - `Recipes_*` modules,
  - `Professions_*` modules,
  - `LodgeProjects_*` modules.

But for **right now**, you don’t have to wire any of that:

- B151 = design, lives in GameBible.
- This file (B152) = your **map** for Greatwood systems.
- Code can wait.
