# 55 – Specialty Ingredients from Hunts, Bosses, and Events

## Purpose

Create a set of **specialty ingredients** that only drop from specific hunts, bosses, and world events in Greatwood. These ingredients:

- Make big encounters feel economically meaningful
- Feed into advanced Cooking (52, 53) and future Alchemy (58)
- Help differentiate “normal hunting” from “serious hunts / dungeons / events”

This is a design list + ruleset, not implementation code.

## Design Goals

1. **Memorable sources**  
   When you see an ingredient, you should remember *what* you killed or survived to get it.

2. **Tightly scoped uses**  
   Each specialty ingredient should have 1–3 **specific, high-value uses**, not be tossed into every recipe.

3. **Early but expandable**  
   Focus on Greatwood 1–20 content now, but leave room to extend this pattern to future regions.

4. **Reinforce fantasy**  
   Names, effects, and sources should reinforce the hunter / forest / Lodge themes.

---

## Structure for Each Ingredient

Each specialty ingredient entry:

- **ID:** `spec_ingr_<theme>` (e.g. `spec_ingr_elder_stag_marrow`)
- **Display Name**
- **Source Type:** Hunt / World Boss / Dungeon / Event / Quest
- **Source Details:** specific enemy, event, or scenario
- **Rarity within source:** always / chance / rare proc
- **Suggested Uses:**
  - 1–3 specific recipes or crafts (IDs)
- **Effect Theme:** what kind of buffs or mechanics it leans toward
- **Flavor Text**

## Rules & Integration

- These ingredients should **not** drop randomly everywhere.  
  Each has **at most a few specific sources**.
- Most should be:
  - Visible in loot tables for relevant bosses/encounters
  - Referenced in:
    - Cooking recipes (52, 53)
    - Profession questlines
    - Future Alchemy stub (58)

- Avoid making them mandatory for all progression:
  - They’re *special*, not “always-on” power.

---

## Next Actions

- Lock final list of specialty ingredients for Greatwood 1–20 launch.
- Map each ingredient to 1–3 concrete recipes/crafts (by ID).
- Hook drops into:
  - World boss loot tables
  - Dungeon rewards
  - Event reward pools
  - Lodge reputation / quest outcomes
