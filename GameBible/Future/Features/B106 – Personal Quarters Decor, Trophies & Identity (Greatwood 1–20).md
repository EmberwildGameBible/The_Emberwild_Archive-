# B106 – Personal Quarters Decor, Trophies & Identity (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Turn B100’s high-level “Personal Quarters & Identity” concept into real, usable content for the Greatwood 1–20 slice:

Define room tiers and their slots.

Define decor categories (furniture, trophies, mementos, curios, functional props).

Provide a catalogue of early-game items and how they’re unlocked:

Through Hunts (61, B103)

Lodge Projects (B102)

Labs & Research (B101)

Social systems & titles (B105)

Events & festivals (B104)

Corruption/warding (91)

Establish the identity loop: your quarters reflect what you’ve done.

This is not the full global housing system, just the Greatwood starter band.

Design Pillars

Read Your Life at a Glance

Entering your quarters should visually tell:

What you’ve hunted.

Which circles you favor.

How you deal with corruption.

What events you’ve lived through.

Lightweight But Sticky

Simple placement system:

Limited slots, no Sims-level free placement needed.

The emotional attachment comes from:

Where an item came from.

What it says about you.

Show, Don’t Spreadsheet

Unlocks are tied to:

Hunts.

Projects.

Titles/epithets.

Events.

The UI focuses on:

“You earned this by doing X” vibes, not raw stats.

Cosmetic First, Functional Second

Most items are cosmetic.

A few provide:

Small quality-of-life.

Mild buffs.

Nothing here is mandatory power.

Forward-Expandable

B106 is the base template:

Later regions add more decor sets.

Higher-level Lodges add room wings, themes, more slots.

Room Tiers & Slots (Greatwood 1–20)

Personal quarters are gated via Lodge Projects (B102):

F1: “Carve Out Hunter Quarters” → unlock Tier 1.

F2: “Upgrade Hunter Quarters” → unlock Tier 2.

Higher tiers beyond Greatwood are defined later; this file only does Tier 1–2.

Tier 1 – “Carved Quarters”

Description:

Small, cozy cell with:

Bed.

One small shelf.

A bit of wall space.

Visual baseline:

Rough timber walls.

One small window/vent.

Simple door.

Slots:

Bed Slot – 1 item (bed style).

Wall Slot (Trophy) – 1 item (head, antlers, plaque, banner).

Shelf Slot (Mementos) – 1 item (small objects, books, curios).

Corner Slot (Small Furniture / Utility) – 1 item (stool, crate, lantern stand).

Mechanics:

Resting in your bed:

Gives a “Slept in Quarters” version of rest buff (slightly better than generic bunk, plus small social flavor).

No direct buffs from decor at this tier beyond cosmetic + flavor.

Tier 2 – “Improved Quarters”

Description:

Larger or better-arranged space:

Slightly wider floor.

More wall and shelf area.

Better light.

Visual baseline:

Upgraded door and framing.

Some minimal decorative trim.

Slots (Tier 1 slots remain; add new ones):

Bed Slot

Wall Trophy Slot A

Wall Trophy Slot B (NEW)

Shelf Slot A

Shelf Slot B (NEW)

Corner Slot

Floor Utility Slot – 1 functional prop (e.g., small writing desk, map stand, personal stash hook).

Mechanics:

Bed rest:

Slightly improved rest buff vs Tier 1.

Floor Utility Slot:

Allows one mild utility feature:

E.g. access to stash, light research ledger, Hunt notes, etc (see below).

Decor themselves still mostly cosmetic, with a few tagged items giving very small, non-stacking perks.

Decor Categories

For 1–20 we support these categories:

Beds & Bedding

Wall Trophies

Shelf Mementos & Curios

Furniture & Utility

Circle & Lodge Tokens

Event & Festival Memorabilia

Corruption & Warding Relics (Safe)

Each item entry has:
