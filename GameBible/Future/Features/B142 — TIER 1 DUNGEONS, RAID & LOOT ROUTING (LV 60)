By the time a player farms:

they should have roughly 2–4 pieces of their desired set, plus mats for legendary chains.

3. Tier 1 Raid — Citadel of Convergence

Theme:
A fortress built where ley-lines from Greatwood, Ashen Ridge, Frostmarch, and Duskhollow intersect. All elements—nature, fire, frost, shadow—are converging and mutating.

Loot Goals:

This fight is where you finish your 4-piece set, regardless of role.

Also the source of rare endgame mats.

Drops:

One guaranteed T1 Legendary Set piece for each armor type present:

Bulwark (tank)

Evershatter (STR DPS)

Skyshatter (AGI ranged)

Nightveil (AGI melee)

Star-Eater (caster)

Dawnsong (healer)

Extra drop table:

High chance at:

CORE_OF_CONVERGENCE — used for future Tier 2 legendaries.

Small chance at:

Random T1 legendary relic upgrade tokens (purely tuning or cosmetics).

So the raid acts as:

The capstone of Tier 1,

The place you get your 4-piece bonus,

The teaser for higher tiers.

4. Legendary Scenarios as Endgame Pillars

These are already defined in B137–B139, but here’s where they sit conceptually:

The Ember Crucible — Tank-focused, ends in Emberheart Aegis.

Colossus Forge — STR DPS-focused, ends in Evershatter Colossusblade.

Star-Eater Rite — Caster DPS-focused, ends in Star-Eater Conduit.

Shattered Sky Hunt — Ranged AGI-focused, ends in Skyshatter Huntbow.

Silent Court — Melee AGI-focused, ends in Nightveil Prowler.

Long Night — Healer-focused, ends in Dawnsong Covenant (and optionally Heartroot Reliquary).

Each:

Is tuned around having some T1 set pieces and solid blues.

Feels like a mini “raid encounter” built just for that playstyle.

Hooks into the Relic Codex as:

“Legendary Scenario Completed” flags.

5. Example Boss Loot Table (Lua-ish)

Here’s what one endgame boss might look like in data:

local function LootEntry(itemId, chance, minCount, maxCount)
    return {
        itemId   = itemId,
        chance   = chance,
        minCount = minCount or 1,
        maxCount = maxCount or minCount or 1,
    }
end

LootTables["Raid.Citadel.ConvergenceHeart"] = {
    coin = { min = 0, max = 0 }, -- gold handled elsewhere

    -- Tier 1 set pieces (weights assume multiple rolls)
    equipment = {
        LootEntry("ITEM_EMBERHEART_BULWARK_HELM",      0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_EMBERHEART_BULWARK_BREASTPLATE",0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_EVERSHATTER_WARHELM",          0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_EVERSHATTER_WARPLATE",         0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_SKYSHATTER_TRACKERS_HOOD",     0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_SKYSHATTER_TRACKERS_JERKIN",   0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_NIGHTVEIL_ASSAILANTS_COWL",    0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_NIGHTVEIL_ASSAILANTS_VEST",    0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_STAR_EATER_HOOD",              0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_STAR_EATER_ROBE",              0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_DAWNSONG_CIRCLET",             0.10, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("ITEM_DAWNSONG_RAIMENT",             0.10, 1, 1),
    },

    mats = {
        LootEntry("MAT_CORE_OF_CONVERGENCE", 0.40, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("MAT_SOVEREIGNS_SHADOWCORE", 0.05, 1, 1),
        LootEntry("MAT_ETERNAL_FROSTHEART_CORE",0.05,1,1),
        LootEntry("MAT_EMBERFORGE_HEART",      0.05, 1, 1),
    },

    ultra = {
        LootEntry("ITEM_T1_RELIC_UPGRADE_TOKEN_RANDOM", 0.02, 1, 1),
    },
}


You can keep tuning these numbers, but structure-wise it’s consistent with all your earlier loot tables.
