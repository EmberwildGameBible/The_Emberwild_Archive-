# 61 – Greatwood Hunt Board & Deeds System

## Purpose

Define the **Greatwood Hunt Board** and **Deeds system** as the core loop for structured hunting content:

- Gives players **repeatable, curated hunts** with clear goals  
- Ties into Lodge reputation, professions, and special ingredients  
- Establishes a framework that can expand to other regions later

This is a design spec for **how the Hunt Board works**, what “Deeds” are, and how they tie into rewards and progression.

## Key Concepts

### Hunt Board

A physical board in the Lodge (and possibly outposts) where players pick up:

- **Hunts:** Kill X of Y, track and kill a specific beast, capture/drive off enemy
- **Special Assignments:** Time-limited or event-based hunts
- **Deeds:** Longer, named challenges (mini-questlines)

### Deeds

**Deeds** are special, named contracts that:

- Are tracked individually with their own progress
- Have higher rewards and unique flavor
- Often tie into story, bosses, or rare ingredients

Examples:  
- “The Boar That Wouldn’t Die”  
- “Warden of the Hollowroot Edge”  
- “The Beast That Hunts Fire”

---

## Hunt Board Structure

### Board Layout

- Board shows **3–5 active hunts** at a time.
- Hunts are categorized:
  - **Common Hunts** – simple daily-style tasks
  - **Notices** – special or time-limited opportunities
  - **Deeds** – ongoing boss/elite challenges

### Difficulty & Scaling

- Hunts are tagged with:
  - Recommended level band (e.g. 1–5, 5–10, 10–20)
  - Solo/Group suggestion
- Scaling rules (implementation later):
  - Base stats & AI scale within Greatwood’s band
  - Deeds might have fixed levels (non-scaled “hard posts” in the zone)

---

## Hunt Types (Common)

These are low-mid effort tasks that keep players in the loop between big content.

1. **Culling Hunts**
   - Example: “Cull 8 Ash-Touched Boar”
   - Goal: Kill X creatures of type Y in a sub-region.
   - Reward: Modest XP, coin, small rep, chance at relevant ingredients.

2. **Track & Kill**
   - Example: “Track the Three-Horn Stag”
   - Goal: Follow tracks to a target spawn and kill a named or tougher variant.
   - Reward: Better XP, coin, rep, chance at specialty drops.

3. **Deterrence**
   - Example: “Drive Off a Pack Leader”
   - Goal: Kill the alpha of a wolf pack or similar.
   - Reward: Similar to Track & Kill but more social/faction flavor.

4. **Resource Protection**
   - Example: “Protect the Gatherers”
   - Goal: Defend an area or NPC while they gather.
   - Reward: XP, coin, rep, possible extra resource bundle.

## Deeds (Named Contracts)

Deeds are more substantial, with their own entries in the player’s log. They can span multiple steps.

### Example Deed: “The Boar That Wouldn’t Die”

- **Premise:**
  - A specific massive boar has survived multiple hunts, scarred and enraged.
- **Steps:**
  1. Investigate sites of failed hunts (find broken weapons, scattered meat)
  2. Track unique signs (deep hoof-marks, gouged trees)
  3. Face the boar in a special arena spot (with mechanics)
- **Rewards:**
  - Unique trophy
  - Specialty ingredient (e.g. `spec_ingr_ash_touched_beast_cut`)
  - Unlock of a special recipe or profession tool

### Example Deed: “The Beast That Hunts Fire”

- **Premise:**
  - Something hunts near wildfire scars and attacks anyone with a torch.
- **Steps:**
  1. Patrol wildfire edges at night
  2. Survive ambush encounters
  3. Trigger a final “lure” event using a ritual hunt offering (57)
- **Rewards:**
  - High-tier ingredient or alchemical reagent
  - Stronger hunt rewards than normal

## Board Flow & Refresh

### Common Hunts

- Rotate on a **timer** (e.g. daily cycle, or per-session).
- Limited number available at once (3–5).
- Player can accept a limited number concurrently (e.g. 3 active hunts).

### Deeds

- Do **not** rotate as quickly.
- Once a player unlocks a Deed:
  - It stays available until completed or abandoned.
- Some Deeds unlock via:
  - Reputation thresholds (59)
  - Previous hunts (completing X culling hunts unlocks a Deed)
  - Quest progress (connecting to other Greatwood story beats)

---

## Rewards & Integration

### Baseline Rewards

Each completed Hunt rewards:

- XP (player level)
- Coin
- Lodge rep (general or specific wings, depending on target)
- Small chance at relevant ingredients (meat, pelts, herbs, etc.)

### Special Rewards

- Deeds can reward:
  - Specialty ingredients (55)
  - Profession rep (59)
  - Unique recipes (52, 53, 57)
  - Profession tools (54)
  - Cosmetic trophies (wall mounts, trinkets)

### Reputation & Board

- Higher Lodge reputation and profession ranks:
  - Unlock better hunts and Deeds
  - Increase odds of valuable drops or extra rewards

## UI / UX Notes

- Board should feel **physical**:
  - Papers pinned, some crossed out, some torn.
- Accepted hunts:
  - Marked on the board as “Taken.”
  - Visible in player’s quest log under a **Hunts** category.

- Deeds:
  - Have more elaborate parchment, unique icon, sometimes wax seals.
  - Might have brief lore snippet on the board itself.

## Next Actions

- Define a **first-wave list** of:
  - 10–15 Common Hunts
  - 3–5 Deeds for Greatwood 1–20
- Connect Hunts & Deeds to:
  - Actual enemy families and spawn regions in Greatwood
  - Lodge rep and profession systems (51–60)
- Draft quest log text for 1–2 Deeds as examples.
