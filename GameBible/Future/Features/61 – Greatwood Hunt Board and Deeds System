61 – Hunts, Targets, and the Core Hunt Loop (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define how Hunts work in Emberwild for the Greatwood 1–20 slice, including:

What a Hunt is, structurally and fictionally.

How Hunts are:

Accepted (via Lodge & Hunt Board, 59).

Prepared for (gear, alchemy, corruption).

Played out in the world (tracking, encounters, target behaviors).

Resolved (turn-in, reputation, world changes).

How Hunts connect to:

Corruption (91).

Alchemy (58).

Lodge circles and contracts (59).

Dungeons and lairs (65, 77).

This is the “spine” of the early game. Nearly everything else feeds this loop.

Core Fantasy

A Hunt in Emberwild is not just “kill 10 wolves”. It is:

A contract taken in a living Lodge.

A target with a history, patterns, and a place in the ecosystem.

A journey:

Out from the Lodge.

Through the wilds and corruption pockets.

To a lair, lair-equivalent, or scenario.

A return:

With trophies, scars, stories, and consequences.

The player should feel:

“I am a hunter sent to solve specific problems in a dangerous, responsive forest.”

Design Pillars

Fewer Hunts, More Meaning

Hunts are not disposable chores.

Each Hunt is:

Tied to a threat, a place, and at least one Lodge circle.

Typed, named, and slightly bespoke.

Even repeatable Hunts are framed as:

Ongoing issues.

Shifting threats.

Preparation Matters

Food buffs (Cooking), Alchemy (58), gear, and contract knowledge are critical.

Good preparation makes:

Fights manageable.

Corruption risk lower.

Rewards more consistent.

Tracking and Terrain First

Finding the target is half the Hunt:

Tracks.

Scents.

Signs.

The world layout matters more than UI waypoints.

Target Behaviors Are the Point

Each notable target has:

Behavior traits.

Movement patterns.

Phases or reactions.

The Hunt is built around those behaviors, not just their HP bar.

World and Lodge React

Completing Hunts:

Changes ZCL in pockets (91).

Moves Lodge rep tracks (59).

Alters spawn patterns and local stories.

Components Overview

Hunts are structured around:

The Contract – how the Hunt is defined and accepted.

The Target – who or what the Hunt is about.

The Trail – how the hunter finds the target.

The Encounter – how the fight or resolution plays out.

The Resolution – rewards, reputation, world changes.

1. The Contract
Structure

A Hunt Contract is a data object with:

Contract ID and flavor name.

Type and tier.

Recommended level range.

Target description:

Single boss.

Pack alpha.

Cluster of threats.

Region and ZCL expectations (91).

Rewards:

Gold.

Items.

Reputation with circles (59).

World-state adjustments (optional).

Example fields (conceptual):

contract_id: hunt_greatwood_howler_01

name: “The Greatwood Howler”

type: APEX_BEAST

tier: 1

recommended_level: 8–12

region: greatwood_east_ridge

corruption_tag: TAINTED (ZCL 1–2)

offered_by_circles: Lodge Proper, Huntmasters

rewards_base: gold, materials, Huntmasters rep

rewards_bonus: extra if target is killed under certain conditions.

Types of Hunt Contracts (Greatwood)

For 1–20, we need a tight set of core types:

Cull Hunts

Objective:

Reduce numbers of a specific threat.

Targets:

Packs of beasts, corrupted variants, bands of raiders.

Examples:

“Cull the Hollowroot Stalkers” (reduce spawn rate near Hollowroot Fringe).

Mark Hunts

Objective:

Kill a specific named creature or small group.

Targets:

Apex beasts, corrupted champions.

Examples:

“The Greatwood Howler.”

“Black-Sap Devourer.”

Trail Hunts

Objective:

Track a roaming target through multiple pockets.

Targets:

Migratory creatures.

Corruption carriers.

Examples:

“Chasing the Sap-Drunk Elk” across several ZCL-1–3 pockets.

Lair Hunts

Objective:

Infiltrate and clear a lair or mini-dungeon.

Targets:

Nesting beasts, cult bands, corruption nodes plus guardian.

Examples:

“Rooted in the Dark” – kill a corrupt lair boss and burn the nest.

All of these reuse common pieces but emphasize different parts of the loop.

2. The Target
Target Archetypes (Greatwood)

We define some early archetypes:

Apex Beast

Large, territorial, usually with:

Roaming path.

Lair.

Behavior:

Patrols, responds to intrusions, may flee at low health.

Corrupted Champion

A beast or humanoid twisted by Corruption (91).

Behavior:

Gains special corruption attacks or phases at high ZCL.

Might empower nearby corrupted minions.

Pack Alpha

Leader of a smaller group.

Behavior:

Coordinates pack behavior.

Calls reinforcements.

Node-Linked Guardian

Bound to a corruption node (91).

Behavior:

Fights near node.

Gains bonuses if node remains intact.

Each target has a profile:

Health / damage profile.

Movement and terrain preferences.

Special mechanics (phases, enrages, retreats).

Target Knowledge

Contracts can indicate varying levels of knowledge:

Well-known target:

NPCs give strong hints about:

Weaknesses.

Patterns.

Unknown or newly discovered target:

Player must:

Observe behavior.

Experiment.

Over time, the Lodge can update descriptions based on player progress, representing learning.

3. The Trail (Tracking)
Tracking Overview

Finding the target involves:

Reading signs in the world.

Using skills and tools (including Alchemy, 58).

Following a chain of clues to:

A current roaming location.

A lair.

We avoid simple “follow the glowing line” and instead:

Use multiple, overlapping clue types with optional UI assistance.

Clue Types

Tracks

Footprints, claw marks, disturbed underbrush.

Variants:

Fresher tracks glow subtly in Hunter Vision.

Different gait depending on target state (wounded vs healthy).

Scatters and Remains

Bones, carcasses, partially eaten kills.

Indicate:

Target diet.

Possible spawn hazards (other scavengers).

Sound Cues

Distant howls, roars, branch breaks.

Intensify as player gets closer.

Environmental Effects

For corrupted targets:

Patches of corruption.

Ichor splatters.

Warped plants (91).

NPC Sightings

Contracts can include:

Reported sighting locations.

Player can:

Talk to scouts or villagers in the field for updated hints.

Tracking Mechanics (Greatwood Slice)

Players can enter a Focused Tracking Mode:

Short-duration state that:

Highlights relevant clues.

Suppresses some visual noise.

Costs:

Stamina over time.

Or has a cooldown.

Alchemy synergies:

Nighttracker Brew (58):

Buffs the visibility and range of tracks at night.

Other tonics can:

Extend tracking duration.

Enhance scent cues or highlight signs more strongly.

Difficulty:

Early Hunts:

Mostly linear clue paths.

Later 1–20 Hunts:

Branching possibilities.

Need to distinguish fresh vs old trails.

4. The Encounter
Encounter Spaces

The Hunt encounter can take place in:

Open-World Spaces

Glades, riverbanks, corrupted pockets.

Players can approach from multiple angles.

Hybrid Spaces

Open area leading to a cave mouth or lair entrance.

Target may move between inside/outside.

Lairs and Mini-Dungeons

Structured, smaller versions of full dungeons (65, 77).

Often the location of:

Pack dens.

Node-guardians.

Fight Phases and Behaviors

For notable targets, even in 1–20, we aim for simple but meaningful phases.

Example: Apex Beast (Greatwood Howler)

Phase 1: Territorial Assault

Charges, knockdowns, howl roar.

Intermittent adds (smaller wolves).

Phase 2: Wounded Fury (triggered at low health)

Changes movement pattern.

Uses new attack:

Frenzied pounce with bleed.

Attempts to retreat deeper into lair if possible:

Player can chase or let it escape (with consequences).

Example: Corrupted Champion

Phase 1: Base Combat

Standard melee or ranged attacks.

Phase 2: Corruption Surge

At threshold, draws from nearby corrupted ground:

Gains new mutation ability.

Spawns corrupted minions.

Zone Interactions:

High ZCL amplifies its corruption phase effects.

Cleansing nodes first (91) can weaken it.

Group vs Solo

In Greatwood 1–20:

Hunts are tuned primarily for:

Solo hunters.

Small groups (2–3).

Scaling knobs:

Additional adds in group play.

Slight target health / damage adjustments.

Group-specific bonuses:

Group Hunts may yield:

Extra trophy pieces.

Bonus rep when all participants are Lodge members.

5. Resolution
Completing a Hunt

A Hunt is considered complete when:

Primary objective is met:

Target killed.

Target driven off.

Node destroyed and guardian slain.

Optional objectives:

Minimal collateral damage.

Kill without using certain tools.

Kill within a time window.

Results of completion:

Contract updates to Completed.

Player gathers:

Trophies (teeth, horns, ichor, unique drops).

Evidence items (tags, marks, captured data).

On return to Lodge:

Turn-in at:

Hunt Board.

Huntmaster NPC.

Rewards:

Payout.

Reputation.

World changes (if applicable).

Failure and Escape

Hunts can fail in multiple ways:

Target escapes the region:

Contract may:

Expire.

Downgrade to a new contract later with higher difficulty.

Player dies or abandons:

Contract remains active unless:

Time limit exists.

World event closes it.

Consequences:

Repeated failures or abandonments:

Minor rep penalties with offering circle.

Increased ZCL in the area if target is corruption-linked (91).

In some story Hunts:

Target surviving can:

Escalate threats.

Appear later as a stronger version.

Hunt Tiers and Difficulty (Greatwood)

Define Hunt difficulty in tiers:

Tier 0: Training Hunts

For new players.

Simple cull contracts, no real tracking.

Tier 1: Standard Hunts

Basic apex beasts, low-corruption champions.

Minimal phase complexity.

Tier 2: Signature Hunts

Named beasts with multiple phases.

Clear story relevance.

Tier 3: Prototype Challenge Hunts (late 1–20)

Harder, optional.

Tie into corruption and Lodge politics.

Each tier influences:

Reward bands.

Reputation yield.

Likelihood of world changes.

Integration With Other Systems
With Lodge & Reputation (59)

Each Hunt contract card lists:

Circle sponsors:

Huntmasters for most combat Hunts.

Wardens for corruption-heavy Hunts.

Lodge Proper for region stability Hunts.

Rep rewards on completion.

Rank-up opportunities:

Completing milestone Hunts:

May unlock formal ceremonies.

Advance narrative ranks (Pledged, Bound, Sworn).

With Corruption & Cleansing (91)

Many Hunts have:

Corruption tags:

Uncorrupted, Tainted, Warped, Riven-touched.

ZCL requirements:

Some targets only spawn if ZCL is high enough.

Some Hunts aim to lower ZCL by killing key sources.

Completing corruption-linked Hunts:

Lowers ZCL in target pockets.

Or slows their creep.

Failing those Hunts:

Allows ZCL to increase.

May spawn new corrupted variants.

With Alchemy (58)

Hunts produce ingredients:

Monster essences.

Rare tissues.

Certain Hunts:

Specifically request you bring back alchemical reagents.

Reward:

Recipes like Purge of the Glade, Warden’s Veil, Scribe’s Focus, etc.

Attempting Hunts in high-corruption zones without:

Cleanses.

Warding brews.

Is significantly more dangerous.

With Dungeons and Lairs (65, 77)

Some Hunts:

Start as open-world contracts.

Lead into:

Lair instances.

Dungeon wings.

Completing those Hunts:

Changes the state of the dungeon:

Removes or changes some enemy groups.

Alters future runs.

Might open:

Deeper paths.

Story variants.

UI and Player Experience
In Lodge

Hunt Board:

Tabs for Hunt types (Standard, Corruption, etc.).

Icons showing:

Threat type.

Corruption level.

Circle sponsors.

Contract Details panel:

Brief lore blurb about target.

Region and rough ZCL indication.

Known traits or rumored weaknesses.

In the World

Minimal HUD markers by default:

Optional difficulty assists:

Subtle trail markers if the player opts into more guidance.

Tracking Mode:

Toggled by a key.

Visually emphasizes:

Tracks.

Clues.

Hunt Status:

Simple in-world UIs:

Contract progress updates.

Notes when target has changed location or behavior.

Tuning Guidelines (Greatwood Slice)

Most players should:

Complete several Tier 1 Hunts.

Try at least a couple of Tier 2 Signature Hunts by level 20.

Time budget:

A standard Hunt (contract to turn-in) should be:

Roughly 15–30 minutes depending on playstyle.

Failure:

Allowed and expected.

Should feel like:

“I misjudged this target, I will come back better prepared.”

Not like:

“I just wasted my time for nothing.”

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

The framework here is intended to support:

Larger-scale Great Hunts:

Multi-phase operations over an entire region.

Seasonal campaigns:

Lodge posting time-limited chains of themed Hunts.

Factional Hunts:

Competing companies or outsiders placing their own contracts.

Player-generated Hunts:

Later systems where players can mark threats and have the Lodge formalize those as contracts for others.

All future expansions should reuse:

Contract types.

Target archetypes.

Trail / encounter / resolution loop.

Rather than inventing entirely new mechanics, future work should deepen and specialize Hunts built on this base.
