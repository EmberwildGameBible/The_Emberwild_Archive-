B139 — LEGENDARY DAWNSONG RELICS (HEALER · LV 60)

Now a healer-focused legendary pair, so support specs have a chase path:

Dawnsong Covenant — 1H healer mace.

Heartroot Reliquary — healer trinket or off-hand (I’ll make it a trinket; off-hand slot is crowded).

1. Dawnsong Covenant (Legendary Healer Mace)
1.1 Item Definition

Dawnsong Covenant
Level 60 · 1H Mace · Legendary
“Forged from every prayer whispered in Emberwild’s worst nights.”

Stats:

+40 Intellect

+34 Spirit

+30 Stamina

+72 Spell Power

+2% Healing Done

+8 Mana per 5 sec

Passive — Dawnsong Chorus:

Your single-target healing spells apply Dawnsong Chorus to the target for 8 sec:

While active, 10% of your overhealing on that target becomes a small shield instead of being fully wasted (up to a cap).

Internal cooldown per target: 12 sec (so you can’t spam infinite shields).

Passive — Covenant of Respite:

When any party or raid member falls below 30% HP:

Your next healing spell cast within 6 seconds has +20% increased healing.

Internal cooldown: 20 sec.

1.2 Acquisition — The Dawnsong Vigil

Questline name: “The Dawnsong Vigil”

Fantasy: You’re healing important NPCs / events in each zone, not killing things.

Step 1 — Wardens of the Wild

Objectives:

Greatwood: Keep a Warden of Heartroot alive through waves of Blightspore / Widow attacks.

Ashen Ridge: Keep a Forge-Priest alive as they stabilize a runaway furnace.

Frostmarch: Heal/cleanse a Frostmarch Hermit during a ritual to calm a blizzard.

Duskhollow: Protect a Duskhollow Penitent as they atone in a shadow ritual.

Each success grants:

One “Dawnsong Memory” corresponding to the zone.

Turn in all four to a central priest NPC, High Cantor Elyndra.

Reward:

“Unbound Dawnsong Mace Head” (quest item, not equip).

Next quest.

Step 2 — Binding the Covenant

Objectives:

Perform three Covenant Rites in your hubs or shrines:

Rite of Ember — Ashen Ridge altar.

Rite of Frost — Frostmarch altar.

Rite of Shadow — Duskhollow altar.

Each rite:

Spawns ghostly echoes of NPCs you saved; you must keep them alive during an echo fight.

After all three:

Your mace head becomes “Tempered Dawnsong Covenant” (unfinished weapon object).

Next quest: “The Long Night’s End.”

Step 3 — The Long Night’s End (Instance)

Instance: “The Long Night” — defense scenario.

Wave-based event:

Players defend a mixed group of NPCs from all zones (Heartroot guardian, Forge-Priest, Hermit, Penitent).

If too many die, fail.

Mechanics:

Darkened sky, shadow/frost spawns.

Periodic pulses that pressure healers.

Healer must juggle:

Direct healing,

Cleanses,

Movement.

Success:

Tempered Dawnsong Covenant → Dawnsong Covenant (equippable Legendary).

2. Heartroot Reliquary (Legendary Healer Trinket)
2.1 Item Definition

Heartroot Reliquary
Level 60 · Trinket · Legendary

Stats:

+24 Intellect

+20 Spirit

+18 Stamina

+1% Healing Done

Passive — Roots of Recovery:

Your periodic healing effects (HoTs) on a target have a small chance to:

Bloom, instantly healing them for a chunk of the remaining HoT value.

Internal cooldown per target: 15 sec.

Use — Heartroot Bloom (2 min CD):

For 12 seconds:

Your HoTs tick 30% faster, but their duration is reduced accordingly (so total healing stays similar, but delivered much faster).

This is a strong “tempo button” for raid healing without straight-up adding absurd HPS.

2.2 Acquisition — Optional Side Chain

You can either:

Make it part of Dawnsong Covenant chain as a bonus if you complete optional challenges, or

Give it a small side-quest:

Quest Idea: “Echoes of the First Grove”

Heal and cleanse corrupted Heartroot trees in Greatwood and a couple other zones.

Final event: restore a Heartroot sapling in your endgame hub, which becomes a sanctuary tree.

Reward: Heartroot Reliquary.

You can decide whether this is:

A pure quest reward,

Or has very low drop chance from a special “First Grove Shade” boss.
