# 54 – Profession Tools & Gear Sets: Forester, Cook, Woodworker

## Purpose

Give each early Lodge profession (Forester, Cook, Woodworker) a **visible, physical identity** through tools, gear, and trinkets that:

- Slightly boost profession performance
- Make the character LOOK like what they do
- Provide a foundation for future profession gear tiers

This is a design spec for **item concepts and progression**, not implementation code.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Instant readability**  
   You should be able to glance at someone and say “that’s a Cook” or “that’s a Forester.”

2. **Small, meaningful bonuses**  
   Slight bonuses to gathering, crafting success, rare proc chance, etc.  
   Nothing so strong that it becomes mandatory to min-max.

3. **Progression hooks**  
   At least 2–3 tiers per profession to support 1–20 content now and higher tiers later.

4. **Tie-in with Lodge and quests**  
   Some tools/gear should be unlocked via Lodge rep, profession questlines, or story beats.
