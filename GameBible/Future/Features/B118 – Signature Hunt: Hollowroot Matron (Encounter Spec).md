Purpose

Fully define the Hollowroot Matron Signature Hunt encounter for Greatwood 1–20:

Narrative framing & dungeon wrapper

Warren layout & lair arena

Phase-by-phase combat behavior

Status & damage interplay (POISON, ROOT, swarm) per B109

Use of:

Hollowroot pockets (B113)

Narrative Identity

What she is

Apex of the Hollowroot Brood family.

A monstrous, chitinous brood queen deep in the Hollowroot Warren, half-fused with fungal growth.

Consciously territorial, not mindless – she is managing a brood ecosystem.

What she represents

The cost of letting infestations go “because they’re just bugs.”

The tension between:

Burning out a nest vs exploiting it for rare resources.

A test of:

Tunnel fighting.

Crowd control.

Resource & stamina management over a multi-stage dungeon.

Perception

Visual:

Massive arachnoid / insectoid form.

Pale, armored plates with glowing fungal bulbs.

Egg sac cluster fused to lower body or arena walls.

Audio:

Constant chittering.

Low, resonant “click-roars.”

Ambient brood skittering from walls and ceiling.

Prerequisites & Entry
Recommended Level & State

Intended level band: 15–20.

Recommended:

Several runs through Hollowroot Fringe & shallow Warren via:

R1 (“Spores on the Wind”) & R4 (“Brood Ledger”) from B115/B116.

Cleanse & anti-POISON brews.

Some fire / area denial tools.

Structural / Quest Prereqs

Must have:

Unlocked mid-depth access to Hollowroot Warren via Warden / Lodge Projects (B102).

Strongly recommended:

Completion of SH-S3 – “Brood Sever” (B116).

Collapses specific tunnels and reduces brood add density during the fight.

Hunt Setup

Accepted from Hunt Board as Signature Hunt: “Hollowroot Matron”.

Briefing:

Led by Tamsin Kree (Warden sergeant) and Elgath (Scholar).

Tamsin:

Frames it as necessary culling before brood overruns the root systems.

Elgath:

Wants live brood patterns recorded and specific samples.

Dungeon & Arena
Warren Structure (Macro)

The Hollowroot Matron hunt is a short lair-dungeon + boss, not just a single room:

Warren Mouth → Descent Tunnels

Mid Chambers (Fungal Cathedral, brood nests)

Brood Sever tunnels (if SH-S3 was done)

Matron’s Cradle (final arena)

Dungeon content pulls from Hollowroot family (B114):

Burrower Grubs

Hollowroot Stalkers

Brood Matriarch Guards

Spore Clusters (field hazards)

Matron’s Cradle – Arena Layout

Large, roughly circular cavern.

Features:

Central Egg Mass

Raised mound of eggs and fungal sacs.

Matron frequently climbs/anchors here.

Outer Tunnel Mouths

3–4 blocked or semi-open burrow tunnels where adds emerge.

Some may be collapsed if SH-S3 done.

Ceiling Fungi Clusters

Drop spores when disturbed.

Spore Patches & Fungal Carpets

Ground zones causing POISON & SLOW if disturbed/walked through.

ZCL

Baseline: 2–3 (corruption-adjacent but more toxic than purely corrupt).

Heightened:

In bursts when broth growth surges / eggs are disturbed.

Encounter Structure

Phases:

Phase 0 – Cradle Entry & Egg Warning

Phase 1 – The Broodmother at Bay (ground control)

Phase 2 – Swarm Ascendant (mobility & adds)

Phase 3 – Last Clutch (eggs & desperation)

Post-Fight – Fire, Spores & Fallout

Phase 0 – Cradle Entry & Egg Warning
Flow

Player enters Matron’s Cradle:

Small circle of safe ground near entrance.

Matron:

Positioned on or near central egg mass, partially dormant.

2–3 Hollowroot Stalkers:

Clinging to walls/ceiling; drop down as you approach.

Tutorialization

First few seconds:

Show:

Spore patch telegraphs (puff when stepped on).

Ceiling fungi that can be pre-cleared by ranged/area attacks.

Optional:

Elgath’s “Brood Ledger” completion gives:

Tooltips / callouts highlighting:

Which brood types to prioritize.

Which environmental hazards are most dangerous.

When player closes to certain radius or deals some damage, Matron fully wakes → Phase 1.

Phase 1 – The Broodmother at Bay

Fantasy: Matron is testing intruders, staying anchored closer to eggs, using limited movement and brood calls.

State

Matron roams mainly:

Around central egg mass.

Short lunges/hops towards player.

Adds:

Periodic Burrower Grubs and Stalkers from outer tunnels.

Core Abilities

Claw Combo

Damage:

Physical – Slashing.

Pattern:

2–3 cleaving swipes in front arc.

Status:

BLEED on last hit if it connects.

Counterplay:

Stay at side or rear.

Dodge timing.

Venom Spit

Telegraphed spit at mid-range.

Damage:

POISON DoT on hit.

Can:

Trigger spore patches if it hits them instead of player (creating bigger clouds).

Counterplay:

Move laterally.

Hide behind small rock/fungus cover.

Brood Call

Short chitter/roar.

Summons:

2–4 Burrower Grubs from tunnel mouths or from holes in floor.

Behavior:

Adds harass, nibble, or spit low-damage poison.

Ground Skitter

Short lunge and skitter past or around player.

Leaves:

A trail of disturbed spores (brief SLOW + minor POISON).

Player Learning Goals

Learn:

“Normal” pattern before chaos.

How adds + poison interplay works.

Practice:

Target prioritization:

Killing spitting Grubs/Stalkers vs trying to burn the boss.

At ~70–75% HP, Matron gives a louder, more frenzied roar, climbs onto the cavern walls briefly, and Phase 2 begins.

Phase 2 – Swarm Ascendant

Fantasy: Matron uses verticality, brood swarms, and spore clouds to overwhelm intruders; the nest fights as much as she does.

State

Matron:

Uses walls & ceiling more:

Climbing, hanging, re-positioning.

Adds:

Stronger waves including Brood Matriarch Guards guarding eggs and tunnels.

Environment:

More spore clouds.

Some small tunnel sections around arena rim become “live” with brood movement.

New/Upgraded Abilities

Ceiling Rush

Matron climbs up and clings to ceiling.

Telegraph:

Ceiling dust & falling spores.

Then:

She rushes along the ceiling and drops down in a targeted crash.

On landing:

KNOCKDOWN in close radius.

Spore patch burst.

Counterplay:

Watch ceiling shadow/marker.

Move out of drop zone.

Brood Swell

Matron shrieks; nearby tunnels shake.

Spawns:

A wave of mixed brood:

Grubs.

Stalkers.

1–2 Brood Matriarch Guards.

Guards:

Body-block pathways.

Protect parts of the egg mass or Matron herself.

Spore Wave

Uses:

A heavy slam or howl.

Effect:

Ring of spores and fungal gas radiates outward.

Damage/Status:

Moderate immediate damage + POISON.

Short SLOW if cloud not escaped.

Counterplay:

Move in toward Matron (if wave expands outward).

Or shelter behind terrain, depending on layout.

Burrow Ambush

Some brood:

Disappear into ground.

Reappear:

Under or behind player after delay.

Telegraph:

Small ground bulge / rumble.

Counterplay:

Step away from disturbed ground.

SH-S3 Influence (Brood Sever)

If Brood Sever (B116) was completed:

Certain tunnel mouths in arena are blocked with rubble:

Fewer brood waves.

Some paths narrower but more predictable.

Phase 2 add density:

Lower, but more tightly focused around a few open tunnels.

If not:

More open tunnels:

Adds can come from multiple directions.

Positioning more complex.

At around 40–45% HP, when enough brood have been killed and Matron has taken heavy damage, she retreats to central egg mass and Phase 3 begins.

Phase 3 – Last Clutch

Fantasy: Cornered and half-dying, Matron fuses herself into the egg mass, trying to birth a final catastrophic swarm or explode the nest in toxic spores.

State

Matron:

Anchored to central egg mound.

Lower mobility; more dangerous area effects.

Environment:

Eggs start pulsing and hatching.

Spore activity ramped significantly.

Core Mechanics

There are two parallel pressures:

Matron’s own HP.

Egg clutch integrity (implicit or explicit “clutch HP”).

Design choice: treat eggs as either:

A separate destructible object; or

A simple progress/gauge triggered by player actions (attacking eggs vs attacking Matron).

Abilities

Egg Surge

If eggs remain mostly intact:

Periodic hatching surges:

Many small Grubs.

Telegraph:

Eggs pulsing with light and movement.

Counterplay:

Focus attacks on eggs between Matron abilities.

Or accept more adds and bring AoE.

Toxic Bloom

Matron channels, drawing in spores.

After delay:

Large AoE toxic burst around egg mound.

Damage/Status:

Strong POISON.

Possibly WOUND (if we want “long-term sickness” flavor).

Counterplay:

Get out of central area.

Use cleansing brews.

Wardens may shield allies.

Binding Roots

Sap/fungal roots spread outward from mound.

Attempt to ROOT players in place.

If combined with Toxic Bloom:

Very dangerous.

Counterplay:

Break free quickly (input mash / heavy attack).

Use movement/cleanse brews.

Desperate Lance

Matron extends long, piercing limbs toward specific targets.

Damage:

High single-hit Pierce.

Status:

WOUND if connected fully.

Counterplay:

Side-step or shield block.

Use LoS from rocks/eggs.

Outcome Variants

We offer two broad player strategies:

A. Burn the Matron, Minimize Egg Damage

Focus mostly on:

Matron’s body.

Result:

Shorter fight time.

More brood hatch:

You must weather a huge final brood surge when she dies.

Post-fight:

Hollowroot population remains higher but leaderless.

Elgath notes “brood chaos,” fewer organized clusters but more scattered ones.

B. Burn the Eggs, Then Finish Matron

Focus:

Systematically destroying eggs between Matron attacks.

Result:

Fewer adds and spore surges.

But:

Longer exposure to Matron’s direct attacks and poison.

Post-fight:

Nest significantly weakened.

Some later Warren encounters are lighter.

Either path kills the Matron, but NPC reactions & local ecosystem differ.

When Matron HP hits zero and eggs are sufficiently disrupted, she collapses into the clutch, emitting a final spore plume that settles into inert, ashen growth.

Difficulty & Role Spotlights
Huntmaster Striker

Shines:

In short damage windows:

After big telegraphs.

Needs:

To be disciplined about not tunneling during:

Spore Wave.

Toxic Bloom.

Great at:

Rapid egg destruction if they commit to that path.

Warden Frontliner

Shines:

Holding choke points against brood waves.

Shielding team from:

Ceiling Rush impact.

Spore Wave segments.

Needs:

Good poison mitigation.

Reasonable Corruption plan (less than Devourer, but still present).

Scholar Field Controller

Shines:

Managing swarm:

Slow, root, and AoE on Grubs, Stalkers, and Matriarch Guards.

Pre-emptively triggering/detonating hazardous spore clusters at safe times.

Needs:

Careful HCL & poison management.

Space awareness in vertical environment.

Corruption-Edge Hunter

This fight:

Is more toxic than corrupt:

Less direct Corruption scaling, more TAG_TOXIC.

Still:

There may be moderate TAG_CORRUPTION from deeper Warren ZCL & some Matron mechanics.

They:

Can still leverage:

Some corruption-scaling tools.

But:

This fight is more about poison resistance and AoE.

Versatile Woodsman

Shines:

Preparation:

Antidotes.

Fire brews.

Trap placement in choke points.

Improvising:

Swapping between egg focus and add control.

Poison & Status Tuning

Per B109:

Primary tags:

TAG_TOXIC (POISON).

TAG_CONTROL (ROOT, occasional STUN/KNOCKDOWN).

Matron:

Shouldn’t one-shot kill a well-prepared player.

Should:

Grind down unprepared players via:

Stacking POISON.

Attrition from swarm.

Cleansing tools:

Cleansebrew Tonic:

Removes or reduces POISON stacks.

Purge of the Glade:

Stronger cleanse, especially helpful in Phase 3.

Infirmary & Medic Isha:

Offer narrative reinforcement about:

Handling post-fight sickness if players are sloppy.
