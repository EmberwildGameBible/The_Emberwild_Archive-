# B159 – Shadow Under the Wardstone – Full Hunt Integration (Greatwood 1–20)

## 0. Purpose

Define **Shadow Under the Wardstone** as a fully integrated late-Greatwood Hunt:

- Narrative role and unlock chain
- Arena layout and encounter phases
- Profession roles (Hunter, Cook, Alchemist, Forager/Woodworker)
- Core + specialty drops (51 / 55)
- Loot behavior aligned with B151
- Lodge projects, trophies, and ward rituals (57)
- Food and brew hooks (52, 53, 58)

This file is the single reference for Shadow Under the Wardstone so you don’t have to cross-stitch multiple docs to work on it.

---

## 1. Role in Greatwood

**Name:** Shadow Under the Wardstone  
**Region:** Beneath/around **Wardstone Hill**, in a subsurface chamber of failed wards  
**Band:** Late Greatwood capstone (recommended 18–20)  
**Type:** Signature Hunt – ward failure / shadow entity / mind pressure

### 1.1 Narrative Identity

Shadow Under the Wardstone is:

- A **coalesced shadow presence** living inside the hollow beneath a main Wardstone structure.
- Born of:
  - Leaked ward energy,
  - Old binding rituals,
  - Corruption that seeped in through neglected cracks.
- It is not just “a monster”:
  - It is what happens when wards are **maintained poorly**, when power is left to rot.

Visually/feel:

- Fragments of **Wardstone** jut through the chamber.
- The entity itself is:
  - A shifting silhouette with **tendrils** and **glinting eyes**, or
  - A mass of shadow anchored to Wardstone brackets and crust.

Mechanically it owns:

- Ward/Shadow reagents:
  - `wardstone_bracket`
  - `wardstone_crust_flake`
  - `shadow_essence_minor`
  - `shadow_essence_major`
  - `spec_ingr_shadow_ward_core`
  - `spec_ingr_clipped_shadow_tendril` (55, B151)

It is:

- The “ward failure” counterpart to:
  - Ward-Bear (ward guardian),
  - Hollowroot Matron / Black Sap (corruption out in the wild),
  - Ragged King (old hunts/ash).

When this fight is done, the player should feel like they’ve “cleaned out under the floorboards” of Greatwood’s wards.

---

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Recommended Placement

Shadow Under the Wardstone should not be available until:

- Player has:
  - Dealt with multiple Hunts (at least two of Stag / Ward-Bear / Howler / Matron / Devourer / Ragged King).
  - Participated in some ward rituals or stabilization projects (57).
  - Seen **Wardstone flickers** and minor ward anomalies.

It is best positioned as:

- The final “check” on the Wardstone Hill storyline in Greatwood 1–20.

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **“The Hill Hums Wrong”**
   - Wardens and villagers report:
     - Wardstone Hill humming at odd times,
     - Flickers of wardlight at night,
     - Shadows that linger longer than they should.
   - Player:
     - Go to Wardstone Hill at dusk/night,
     - Witness wardlight flickers and see shadows that don’t match any object.

2. **Cracks Below**
   - Warden NPC:
     - Reveals there is an **old service shaft** beneath the Hill:
       - Used generations ago to inspect the Wardstone’s foundation.
     - Believes something has nested there.
   - Player:
     - Descends a small side-dungeon:
       - Encounters minor shadow creatures and unstable ward glyphs.
       - Finds **wardstone brackets** knocked loose and crust flakes scattered.

3. **The Shadowed Echo**
   - At the shaft’s deepest point:
     - Player sees a partial manifestation:
       - A shadow tendril or silhouette recoiling from their light.
   - NPCs:
     - Explain the danger:
       - If the entity grows, it could **invert** the Wardstone’s effect, turning it into a beacon for corruption.

4. **Hunt Posting – “Shadow Under the Wardstone”**
   - Hunt board unlocks named posting:
     - “There is something under the Hill that is not meant to be. Descend with light, and either bind it or cut it loose.”

5. **Aftermath**
   - After the Hunt:
     - Wardstone Hill feels different:
       - Wards pulse steadier,
       - Shadows behave normally (for now).
     - Ward NPCs unlock:
       - Shadow/Ward hybrid rituals,
       - Projects using `spec_ingr_shadow_ward_core` and clipped tendrils.

---

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Layout

The arena is a **subterranean ward chamber** beneath Wardstone Hill:

- Central:

  - A **massive Wardstone plinth** or pillar that extends up into the Hill.
  - Multiple **metal/stone brackets** (wardstone_brackets) anchor it to the cavern.

- Surrounding:

  - Broken platforms and ledges.
  - Pits and channels where wardlight once flowed.

- Ambient:

  - Ward glyphs carved into walls and floor.
  - Some glyphs flicker weakly; some are fully dead.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **Wardstone Core Platform (Center)**
  - Main zone where Shadow entity manifests.
  - Ward pulses emanate periodically:

    - Sometimes helping players,
    - Sometimes destabilized and harmful.

- **Bracket Rings**
  - Circular arrangement of Wardstone brackets and reinforcement structures.
  - Interactable:

    - Can be re-aligned or struck to:
      - Emit stable Ward pulses,
      - Or inadvertently feed the Shadow.

- **Shadow Wells**
  - Dark pits and cracks beyond normal light.
  - Shadow tendrils emerge from these wells.
  - Standing too close:

    - Applies slow “Shadow Soak” stacks (DoT, vision dimming).

---

## 4. Boss: Shadow Under the Wardstone – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Shadow/Ward Entity  
**Fight Length Target:** ~5–8 minutes

Core themes:

- Interplay between light and shadow,
- Ward pulses and bracket management,
- Mind/vision pressure, not just HP damage.

---

### 4.1 Baseline Patterns

The “boss” is both:

- A central visible form (core shadow mass), and
- Multiple tendrils/echoes coming from wells and walls.

Key repeated tools:

- **Shadow Swipe**
  - Melee-range tendril lash.
  - Leaves a lingering darkness streak on ground (short-lived hazard).

- **Gloom Dart**
  - Ranged projectiles of condensed shadow.
  - On hit:
    - Chip damage,
    - Short “blur” effect on vision.

- **Ward Pulse (Ambient)**
  - Periodic pulses from the Wardstone core:

    - If stable:
      - Light pushback vs shadows.
    - If destabilized:
      - Short radial damage / debuff for players.

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 – Flickering Anchor

**Trigger:** Start, “boss HP” 100% → ~70%

Focus:

- Introduce shadow vs ward interplay
- Teach bracket function

Mechanics:

- **Shadow Manifest**
  - Core form appears as:
    - A hulking humanoid silhouette or beast-shaped shadow anchored to Wardstone base.
  - Uses:
    - Shadow Swipe,
    - Simple Gloom Darts.

- **Bracket Tuning**
  - Around arena, some Wardstone brackets are:

    - Misaligned,
    - Emitting unstable sparks.

  - Players can interact (or strike them):

    - Correctly tuned bracket:
      - Emits **stabilizing Ward pulse**:
        - Damages Shadow,
        - Pushes back hazards.
    - Incorrectly tuned:
      - Overloads:
        - Small explosion,
        - Damages players and slightly feeds Shadow.

- **Shadow Wells – Minor Activity**
  - Wells occasionally emit:

    - Small shadow wisp adds,
    - Minor darkness patches.

Goal:

- Let players experiment with:

  - Brackets as “light switches”,
  - Basic shadow hazards.

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 – Inverted Glyphs

**Trigger:** HP around ~70% → ~35%

The entity draws deeper on the corrupted glyphs.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Glyph Inversion**
  - Room’s floor/wall glyphs begin to invert:

    - Some glow red/black instead of blue/white.
    - Stepping on or near inverted glyph:

      - Applies “Inverted Ward” debuff:
        - Increased damage from shadow,
        - Reduced benefit from Ward pulses.

- **Shadow Echoes**
  - Entity splits parts of itself into:

    - 2–3 discrete “echo” forms on different ledges.

  - Each echo:

    - Uses Gloom Darts and small swipes.
    - Must be damaged/cleared to reduce overall pressure.

- **Dark Wave**
  - The main core form occasionally:

    - Sends a radial wave of shadow along the floor.

  - Players can:

    - Hide behind Wardstone brackets or pillars,
    - Or use timed Ward pulses to neutralize it.

- **Bracket Risks**
  - Tournament-level twist:

    - Some brackets now have **inactive** glyphs beside them:

      - Reactivating the wrong bracket sequence:
        - Causes more Ward destabilization,
        - Possibly spawning extra echoes.

Goal:

- Increase complexity:

  - Movement puzzle with glyphs and brackets,
  - Multiple threats across verticality.

---

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Heart of Shadow/Light

**Trigger:** HP around ~35% → 0%

The entity partially merges with the Wardstone core.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Core Merge**
  - Shadow pulls into the Wardstone pillar and:

    - The whole pillar darkens.
    - Ward pulses become rarer but stronger.

- **Light/Shadow Swap**
  - Periodically:

    - The arena flips:

      - Some previously “safe” zones darken.
      - Some Shadow Wells become sources of dim safe light.

  - Encourages:

    - Adapting to changing safe spots,
    - Watching visual cues.

- **Tendril Cage**
  - In short windows:

    - Multiple tendrils burst from floor/walls around a player or zone.

  - If players fail to break enough tendrils quickly:

    - Cage collapses:

      - Heavy AoE hit,
      - High stacking Shadow DoT.

- **Ward Core Exposure**
  - At low HP:

    - Short windows where the **pure core** of Wardstone is visible as bright light.

  - During these windows:

    - Players can:

      - Channel or align a specific set of brackets to fire a focused pulse that:

        - Stuns the Shadow,
        - Greatly amplifies damage taken.

Goal:

- Make the last phase a “dance” of:

  - Safe zone swaps,
  - Tendril management,
  - Coordinated Ward pulses.

## 5. Specialty Mechanics & Drops

### 5.1 Base vs Specialty

From B151’s loot for `gw_shadow_under_wardstone`, we have:

- Base items:

  - `wardstone_bracket`
  - `wardstone_crust_flake`
  - `shadow_essence_minor`
  - `shadow_essence_major`

- Specialty items (55):

  - `spec_ingr_shadow_ward_core`
  - `spec_ingr_clipped_shadow_tendril`

---

### 5.2 `spec_ingr_shadow_ward_core`

**Fantasy:**

- A dense, faintly glowing shard of Wardstone core, tainted but not overtaken by shadow.

**Mechanic:**

- First kill:

  - Guaranteed 1 x `spec_ingr_shadow_ward_core`.

- Subsequent kills:

  - Drop chance tied to:

    - Successfully triggering **Core Exposure** pulses in Phase 3:
      - Players must have:

        - Used bracket sequences correctly,
        - Allowed the Wardstone core to flare and damage the Shadow.

- If fight is messy (lots of inverted glyph use, bracket overloads):

  - Chance for core shard may be reduced (lore: core too unstable to safely recover).

Uses:

- High-tier ward rituals:

  - Stabilization or reorientation of wardlines (57).
- Powerful hybrid food/brews:

  - Ward-aligned but with a shadow twist (52/53/58).
- Potential cross-region ward projects.

---

### 5.3 `spec_ingr_clipped_shadow_tendril`

**Fantasy:**

- A piece of shadow that behaves like a physical strand, clipped off in solid form and bound in wardlight.

**Mechanic:**

- Drops as:

  - Moderate chance per kill,
  - Enhanced if:

    - Players break multiple **Tendril Cage** events successfully.
    - Or interrupt several tendril attacks in earlier phases.

Uses:

- Ingredients for:

  - Shadow-ward charms,
  - Limited-use “shadow step” brews,
  - Lodge decorations with subtle animated shadow effects.

---

### 5.4 Wardstone Parts and Shadow Essences

From B151:

---

## 9. Food & Brew Hooks (52, 53, 58)

### 9.1 Food Hooks

While a “shadow under the hill” doesn’t scream food, its reagents still tie into:

- Specialized dishes:

  - `food_wardstone_night_watch_stew`:

    - Uses shadow essences in small amounts,
    - Effects:

      - Night/dark-vision buff,
      - Modest mental/fear resist.

  - `food_shadebound_feast` (Lodge-only, high-tier):

    - Uses Wardstone crust + small amounts of essences,
    - Effects:

      - Big buffs for ward/ritual tasks,
      - Very minor weird visual side effects for flavor.

These should be:

- Clearly flagged as “Lodge experiments” rather than everyday meals.

### 9.2 Brew Hooks

From 58, shadow/ward brews:

- `brew_shadow_ward_sight_draught`

  - Uses:

    - `shadow_essence_minor`,
    - `spec_ingr_clipped_shadow_tendril`.

  - Uses:

    - `spec_ingr_shadow_ward_core`.

  - Effects:

    - Short-duration huge resistance to:

      - Shadow,
      - Corruption.

    - But:

      - Might also temporarily weaken shadow-based brews and abilities.

These brews should feel:

- Powerful,
- Rare,
- Very tied to Wardstone content.

## 12. Implementation Notes (Future You)

In the Game Bible:

- B159 ties together:

  - Wardstone Hill late-game,
  - Ward/Shadow reagents,
  - Ward-focused Lodge and ritual projects.

In data/code later:

- Ties to:

  - B151 loot table for `gw_shadow_under_wardstone`.
  - Ingredient/specialty ids from 51 / 55.
  - Ward food & brew lines in 52 / 53 / 58.
  - Wardstone-related projects and rituals in 57.

When implemented:

- Use B159 as checklist:

  - Subterranean Wardstone arena built? ✔
  - Phases (flicker → inverted glyphs → merge) working? ✔
  - Loot yields correct brackets/crust/essences/core/tendrils? ✔
  - Lodge projects and rituals consume those reagents in a meaningful way? ✔
