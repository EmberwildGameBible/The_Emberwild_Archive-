## 1. Role in Greatwood

**Name:** Greatwood Howler  
**Region:** Greatwood hills, foggy ridgelines, and dense pine/evergreen stretches  
**Band:** Mid–late Greatwood (recommended 14–20)  
**Type:** Signature Hunt – pack predator / morale pressure / sound-based threat

### 1.1 Narrative Identity

The Greatwood Howler is:

- The **alpha wolf** of a long-standing Greatwood pack.
- Larger, leaner, and scarred, with:
  - Pale eyes that reflect wardlight and moonlight.
  - A distinct ribcage silhouette (the “Howler Rib”).
- Its howl carries through the forest:
  - Panicking animals,
  - Fraying hunter nerves,
  - Attracting lesser wolves.

Howler represents:

- The **predatory pressure** of the forest:
  - When prey is scarce, packs become desperate.
  - When Hollowroot / Black-Sap spread, packs get driven into stranger behavior.
- A bridge between:
  - Everyday wolves (`gw_wolf`, `gw_dire_wolf`),
  - Warbrew / pack synergy:
    - `brew_howler_warbrew` (58),
    - war-foods, hunter “pack tactics”.

Mechanically, Howler owns:

- Wolf-side specialties:
  - `spec_ingr_howler_throat_bundle`
  - `spec_ingr_howler_ear_fragment` (55)
- High-end wolf meat & parts:
  - `dire_wolf_flank`
  - `greatwood_howler_rib` (51/B151)
- War and morale loops:
  - Warbrew and pack buff dishes (52/53/58).
  - Hunt projects for Hunters / war-parties (57).

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Placement in Greatwood Progression

Greatwood Howler should feel like:

- The **wolf apex** – the last step in the wolf line:
  - You’ve fought common wolves and dire wolves.
  - You’ve seen packs ambushing roads and edges of Hollowroot areas.
- A key step:
  - For Hunters who want to specialize,
  - For players who like aggressive, mobile gameplay.

Rough requirement suggestions:

- Player has:
  - Fought several wolf packs in contracts.
  - Finished at least one other major Hunt (Elder Stag, Ward-Bear, or Matron).
  - Reached a reputation threshold with Hunt board / Hunters.

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **“The Hills Don’t Sleep”**
   - Contract:
     - Villagers and hunters report:
       - Wolf howls night after night,
       - Livestock scatters,
       - Even seasoned Hunters can’t sleep.
   - Player:
     - Investigates hills and ridgelines at night or dusk.
     - Fights packs led by unusually coordinated dire wolves.

2. **Track the Alpha**
   - NPC Hunter:
     - Identifies distinctive tracks, kill patterns:
       - “This is a Howler, not just any alpha.”
   - Player:
     - Follows:
       - Trails of broken game,
       - Drag marks where Howler has moved kills to higher ground.

3. **Echo in the Fog**
   - Player is sent to:
     - A foggy ridge where Howler’s howl echoes strangely.
   - Encounter:
     - Ambush waves of wolves,
     - A brief “shadow of Howler” sighting:
       - He appears, howls, and retreats, showing his silhouette, eyes, and ribcage profile.

4. **Hunt Posting – “Greatwood Howler”**
   - Hunt board unlocks named posting:
     - “The Greatwood Howler pulls the whole forest taut like bowstring. Hunt him, or nothing will rest.”

5. **Aftermath**
   - Post-Hunt:
     - Wolf attacks decrease.
     - Hunters talk about:
       - “The silence after a Howler falls.”
     - Lodge unlocks:
       - Warbrew line,
       - Howler trophy & Hunter warpack projects.

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Layout

The arena is a **foggy ridge / broken hilltop**:

- Height & edges:
  - Uneven terrain with:
    - Rock outcrops,
    - Fallen logs,
    - Narrow passes between boulders.
- Visibility:
  - Low fog across the ground.
  - Occasional gusts of wind that:
    - Clear fog in one area,
    - Deepen it in another.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **High Perches**
  - Rock ledges where:
    - Howler may briefly leap up to howl.
  - Gives him:
    - Temporary damage / evasion bonuses,
    - Pack buff pulses.

- **Fog Pockets**
  - Dense fog zones:
    - Reduce visibility,
    - Slightly dampen sound cues.
  - Wolves use:
    - To reposition and ambush.

- **Narrow Passes and Kill Zones**
  - Tight spaces between rocks:
    - Deadly if players get cornered there with multiple wolves.

---

## 4. Boss: Greatwood Howler – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Beast / Alpha Wolf  
**Fight Length Target:** ~4–7 minutes

Core themes:

- Mobility,
- Pack synergy,
- Howl-driven morale and fear.

---

### 4.1 Baseline Attacks

Used throughout, tuned per phase:

- **Bite & Tear**
  - Basic combo:
    - Bite → rake with claws.
  - Can apply:
    - Bleed effect (stacking or timed).

- **Raking Dash**
  - Short dash slash.
  - Can be chained:
    - Dash through player → quick pivot → second dash.

- **Lunging Pounce**
  - Targeted leap:
    - Knocks target down,
    - Briefly pins them unless interrupted or mitigated.

- **Howl**
  - Multiple variants:
    - Pack Rally Howl (buff allies),
    - Fear Howl (debuff players),
    - Lure Howl (summons more wolves).

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 – Echoes on the Ridge

**Trigger:** Fight start, HP 100% → ~70%

Howler tests the group with:

- High mobility,
- Small packs cycling in and out.

Mechanics:

- **Pack Snaps**
  - Howler fights with 2–3 wolves active at once.
  - When one dies:
    - Another may join from edge of arena after short delay.

- **Ridge Dashes**
  - Uses Raking Dash along:
    - Ridge edges,
    - Across open ground.
  - Tries to:
    - Clip players,
    - Herd them into fog pockets or narrow passes.

- **Simple Rally Howl**
  - Buffs:
    - Movement speed and attack of nearby wolves.
  - Can be:
    - Interrupted or disrupted with well-timed abilities (if you want to later).

Goal:

- Teach players:
  - Keep an eye on adds,
  - Don’t get chased into bad terrain,
  - Read simple howl cues.

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 – War-Howl and Panic

**Trigger:** HP around ~70% → ~35%

Howler escalates:

- Howls interact with **player morale / control**.
- Pack presence gets denser.

New/amped mechanics:

- **War-Howl**
  - Stronger howl:
    - Grants:
      - Larger buff to wolves,
      - Minor damage increase for Howler.
  - Also:
    - Creates **Howl Echo zones**:
      - Small ground patches that:
        - Give wolves extra speed / regen.
        - Make player sound cues (steps, swings) muffled or delayed.

- **Fear Howl**
  - Targeted or AoE:
    - Cones or rings outwards.
  - Applies:
    - “Unnerved” debuff:
      - Slight movement/aim jitter,
      - Small chance for inputs to have delayed animation (design-level debuff, not mechanical input blocking IRL, obviously).
  - If players are already low HP:
    - Fear effect slightly stronger.

- **Coordinated Pack Swarm**
  - Instead of random wolves:
    - Spawn groups that:
      - Enter from multiple angles,
      - Attempt to collapse on a single target marked by Howler.

- **Fog Surges**
  - At certain HP thresholds:
    - Fog shifts:
      - Some areas clear, others become opaque.
  - Howler:
    - Tends to attack from densest fog.

Goal:

- Increase intensity and mental load:
  - Sound and vision disorientation,
  - Stronger pack synergy.

---

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Alpha’s Last Stand

**Trigger:** HP around ~35% → 0%

Howler becomes:

- More desperate,
- More reckless,
- More reliant on **long howls** and burst aggression.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Endless Echo Howl**
  - Long, drawn-out howl:
    - Creates multiple overlapping echo zones.
    - Each echo:
      - Buffs existing wolves,
      - Has a chance to spawn new dire wolves if fight drags.

- **Frenzied Pounce**
  - More frequent chain pounces.
  - If two pounces land in a short window on the same target:
    - Heavy bleed,
    - Short “stagger” or ground pin (interruptible by allies).

- **Pack Collapse**
  - At very low HP:
    - Remaining wolves may:
      - Throw themselves between Howler and players,
      - Absorb damage (share HP pool mechanic, if you want).
  - Killing wolves:
    - Weakens this protection,
    - But may also increase rage.

Goal:

- Deliver a fast, dangerous finish:
  - Rewards groups who:
    - Thin the pack smartly,
    - Avoid being overwhelmed by echo zones and fear howls.

## 12. Implementation Notes (Future You)

In the Game Bible:

- B157 defines:
  - Story, vibes, fight, specialties, Lodge hooks.

In data/code:

- Links to:
  - B151 loot tables for:
    - `gw_wolf`,
    - `gw_dire_wolf`,
    - `gw_greatwood_howler`.
  - Ingredient / specialty IDs from 51 / 55.
  - Recipes and brews from 52 / 53 / 58.
  - Projects from 57 (trophies, warbanner, warbrew station).

When building this in-game later:

- Use B157 as checklist:
  - Ridge arena with fog and ledges in place? ✔
  - Pack phases and howl variants implemented? ✔
  - Loot yields proper flanks, ribs, throat, ear? ✔
  - Warbrew, food, and Lodge war projects actually consume those reagents? ✔
