B120 – Signature Hunt: The Ragged King (Encounter & Choice Spec)
Purpose

Define the Ragged King Signature Hunt, focusing on:

Narrative identity: living legend / living question mark.

How it plays in the world, not just as a fight:

Observe vs Kill vs Brutal outcomes.

Reputation, epithets, and circle responses (B105).

Encounter flow:

Repeated sightings.

Final confrontation in the Ragged Clearing (B113).

Integration with:

Ridge Beast family (B114)

Contract packs (B115, B116)

Roles & archetypes (B110)

Lodge systems (B102, B104, B106)

Alignment axes:

Merciful ↔ Ruthless

Cautious ↔ Reckless

Lodge-Faithful ↔ Fringe

This is not just a boss fight; it’s a character in deer form.

Narrative Identity

What it is

An enormous, scarred Greatwood Stag (Ridge Beast family) that has:

Survived multiple Hunts.

Learned Lodge patterns.

Become wary, almost cunning.

Hunters call it “The Ragged King” because:

Its antlers look like a torn crown.

It has survived long enough to feel like a monarch of the Ragged Verge.

What it represents

The question:

“Is every powerful creature just ‘loot’?”

The difference between:

A wild apex beast simply doing what it does.

Corrupted or malicious threats like Devourer/Matron.

A stress-test of:

The player’s values, not just skill.

Key idea

The Ragged King is:

Dangerous, but:

Not inherently hostile unless cornered or repeatedly pressured.

It can be:

Observed.

Challenged and wounded.

Hunted to death.

Or brutally overkilled.

The Lodge:

Doesn’t have a single unified stance on it.

Timeline & Structure

Rather than a single dungeon -> fight, the Ragged King unfolds over time.

Rumor Phase – contracts & Lodge chatter.

First Sighting – scripted encounter where fighting is optional.

Second Contact – choice-heavy field encounter (observe, test, or attack).

Final Hunt – optional Signature Hunt posting:

Player chooses to Hunt or Let Live.

Branching resolution.

The player can:

Trigger final resolution relatively early (mid-phase).

Or let it ride and encounter the King intermittently until late Greatwood.

Phase 1 – Rumors & Setup
Unlock Conditions

Player is:

~Level 8–10+.

Has completed:

Several Ragged Verge Hunts (H1, H4 in B115).

Optional:

Greatwood Howler killed or at least attempted.

Rumors

NPCs begin mentioning:

Lyss Fen:

Reports seeing “a stag that doesn’t run the way it should.”

Other Hunters:

Tell stories of:

Arrows bouncing from its hide.

It leading wolves into ambushes.

Elgath:

Wants it observed:

“Anomalies in behavior are worth more than another set of antlers.”

Ruarc:

Thinks it’s:

“A mark we’ve all earned and no one has collected.”

These rumors also:

Seed the Contract: H4 – “Echo on the Verge” (B115) which can be:

A soft intro to the King via tracking a lesser “echo-beast.”

Phase 2 – First Sighting
Location

On a normal Hunt or travel through Ragged Verge, near:

A quiet glade or small stream crossing.

Encounter

Scripted but not forced combat:

Player enters area:

Camera / attention drawn to a ridge or clearing edge.

The Ragged King:

Steps out from tree line:

Observes player.

Range: mid-distance.

Behavior:

If player:

Draws weapon & charges:

King immediately flees at high speed.

Impossible to realistically catch on first sighting.

Holds still / crouches / uses observe:

King:

Watches a bit.

Turns and leaves at unhurried pace.

System Effects

If player holds back:

Unlocks Field Scribe entry: “Unusual Stag – designation ‘Ragged King’ (Stage 1)”

Minimal rep shifts:

Scholars:

Slight bump if observation used.

Huntmasters:

Neutral or mildly teasing commentary.

No explicit contract yet; this is pure story presence.

Phase 3 – Second Contact (Choice Encounter)
Trigger

After:

First sighting.

A small number of in-game days / Hunts.

Player sees:

Contract marker or world event:

“Unsettling Tracks in the Verge.”

Contract: “Unsettling Tracks”

Type: Hybrid Hunt / Research.

Pocket: Ragged Verge, near/at Ragged Clearing outskirts.

Level Band: 10–14.

Objectives

Track a set of:

Unusual stag prints and disturbed foliage.

Reach:

A small sub-clearing near the Ragged Clearing.

Encounter

Ragged King is there, feeding or standing by a unique old tree or rock.

Player options (system-level, not just dialogue):

Observe from a distance (Field Scribe mode)

Fill observation bar:

Movement patterns.

Reaction to sounds (if player tosses a rock / uses lure).

If completed without spooking it:

Upgrade Scribe entry to Stage 2.

Elgath & Scholars:

Gain noticeable rep.

Ruarc:

Mildly annoyed but amused.

King then:

Leaves calmly again.

Test it (non-lethal / limited aggression)

Player:

Approaches with weapon drawn but does not open with heavy attack.

King response:

Uses:

A few warning bluff charges / horn swipes.

Health:

Once reduced below a threshold (~75% HP):

It unleashes a powerful roar and flees.

Result:

Field Scribe notes:

Learned about its combat behavior.

Huntmasters:

Slight rep bump (“you probed a mark without killing it”).

Wardens:

Slight caution (“you teased a dangerous creature without finishing the job”).

Open serious attack

Player:

Immediately attacks at close or mid range.

King:

Fights back hard for a short time.

If reduced below 40–50% HP:

Flee script triggers:

It escapes into deeper Verge → sets up Signature Hunt proper.

Rep:

Huntmasters:

Bigger bump (you “finally put teeth on this story”).

Scholars:

Disappointed – they want more data.

Merciful vs Ruthless axis nudges:

Slight shift toward Ruthless.

In all but extreme cases:

The Ragged King escapes alive at this stage.

Hunt board afterwards adds:

Signature Hunt: “The Ragged King” as an available contract.

Phase 4 – Signature Hunt Posting
Contract Listing

Name: “The Ragged King”
Type: Signature Hunt – Observe or Kill
Level Band: 12–18
Posted By:

Official: Keeper Maera / Huntmaster Ruarc

Footnoted by: Senior Scribe Elgath

Text (paraphrased):

“A great stag, scarred and uncowed, has ruled the Verge long enough. Some say it’s bad luck to kill him. Others say it’s worse luck to leave the forest’s will unchallenged. The Lodge leaves the outcome in the hands of the hunter who takes this mark. Return with a tale worth the ink.”

Objective Forks

When accepted, the contract has two explicit completion paths:

Path A – “Crown in Hand” (Kill)

Path B – “Crown Unbroken” (Observe / Spare)

The UI might track:

A hidden or visible progress bar for each path:

Progress is driven by what you actually do in the final encounter.

Phase 5 – Final Confrontation (Ragged Clearing)

The confrontation uses the Ragged Clearing (same arena as the Howler, B119), but with different mood and behavior.

Arena Setup

Time:

Early dawn or dusk (player-determined? Could be forced to differentiate from Howler).

Environmental details:

Clearing quieter than for Howler.

Birds occasionally visible.

No pack of wolves; this is a solitary beast.

Encounter Start

Player approaches:

King is grazing or watching from edge.

Short moment:

Player gets control with the King idling in sight.

From here:

Encounter flows into one of several branching modes:

Combat / Behavior Profile

The Ragged King is:

Fast.

Highly mobile.

Less lethal on raw damage than Howler / Matron.

Dangerous because:

It punishes impatience and greed very consistently.

Core Abilities

Testing Charge

Medium-speed charge:

Designed to test whether you dodge or stand.

Damage:

Moderate Physical – Piercing.

Status:

Small KNOCKBACK.

Behavior:

If blocked or dodged cleanly:

King backs off a few steps and “reconsiders.”

If it hits repeatedly:

King escalates aggression (moves closer to full hostile “kill fight”).

Hoof Strike

Short-range, diagonal stomp.

Damage:

Quick moderate hit.

Status:

Very mild stagger.

Use:

If player hangs directly under its head for too long.

Goring Rush (full aggression mode only)

High-speed full commitment charge.

Damage:

Heavy Physical – Piercing.

Status:

WOUND if caught dead center.

Telegraph:

Longer crouch.

Visible breath + head tilt.

Only unlocked:

If player has fully escalated to kill path.

Vault & Retreat

King leaps over logs/rocks:

Using terrain in ways other bosses don’t.

Purpose:

Resets distance.

Encourages:

Player to respect space and not just chase blindly.

Path A – Kill (Crown in Hand)
Trigger Conditions

Player behavior pushes fight into full hostile boss flow if:

Player:

Deals significant damage early (e.g., >25–30% HP) without pause.

Uses:

Brutal/finisher abilities.

Ignores:

Multiple opportunities to bind weapon or holster (if system supports this) / hold/observe.

Phase Structure (Kill Path)

Phase A1 – Probing & Response

King:

Alternates:

Testing Charge.

Short defensive moves.

Player can:

Still back off and choose to end aggression (switch to Path B).

If aggression continues:

King transitions into full boss behavior.

Phase A2 – Crown of Horns

King:

Unlocks Goring Rush.

Uses:

Short combos:

Rush → Hoof Strike → shoulder check.

Terrain:

He uses logs and rocks to reposition and charge from unexpected angles.

Fight:

Feels like:

A mobile dueling encounter, less “arena full of AoE.”

Phase A3 – Bloody Sovereign

At low HP (~20%):

King’s antlers and coat show heavy blood.

Behavior:

More frequent short attacks.

Slightly sloppier movement (limps).

Danger:

Goring Rush still lethal if misread.

Outcome – Kill

When HP hits zero:

The King:

Collapses slowly:

A final thrash, then stillness.

After:

Prompt to:

Claim antlers (trophy).

Harvest hide & meat, or take only symbolic pieces.

System Consequences (Kill)

Rewards:

Ragged King’s Antlers:

Unique trophy.

Component for:

Hunter weapon (high stagger / crit).

Ragged Pelt:

Armor piece:

+Res vs Fear/SUPPRESSED.

XP & Rep:

Strong Huntmasters rep.

Mixed Scholar reaction:

If you did no observation phases:

Lower Scholar approval.

If you fully documented before kill:

More balanced approval.

Axes (B105):

Merciful vs Ruthless:

Killing at all:

Nudge toward Ruthless.

Killing after thorough observation & “clean Hunt”:

Smaller nudge.

Killing quickly with no observation:

Larger nudge.

Cautious vs Reckless:

Taking many unnecessary hits or overcommitting:

Slight Reckless tick.

Clean play:

Slight Cautious tick.

Lodge-Faithful vs Fringe:

Some Huntmasters frame kill as Lodge-affirming:

Slight Lodge-Faithful bump.

Lodge & NPC Reactions:

Ruarc:

Proud. May treat you like “the one who finally took the crown.”

Lyss:

Evaluates whether your tracking and kill were clean.

Elgath:

Opinion depends heavily on whether you logged observations first.

Neris:

Less invested, though she might want tissue samples for odd reasons.

Path B – Observe / Spare (Crown Unbroken)
Trigger Conditions

Player repeatedly chooses:

To observe rather than attack.

To drop weapon stance / sheathe weapon (if system supports).

To heal, back off, and not follow when King retreats.

Flow

Phase B1 – Mutual Distance

Player:

Uses Field Scribe mode.

King:

Occasionally:

Performs Testing Charge at long range.

Stops at a “warning” distance.

Goal:

Fill an extended observation bar:

Behavior, route, reaction to noises, etc.

Phase B2 – Proving Non-Threat

Player may be prompted:

To complete a small non-violent action:

E.g., drop food / herbs.

Stand still as King circles at a distance.

If player:

Attacks during this:

Path A re-engages (with stronger moral shift to Ruthless).

If player:

Holds, King eventually:

Stops, stares, then slowly departs into deeper forest.

Completed “Crown Unbroken” Outcome

Contract resolves:

Through:

Observation completion + explicit decision to let the King live.

Player returns to Lodge:

With:

Full Field Scribe entry.

No physical trophy, but a story.

System Consequences (Spare)

Rewards:

Unique title/epithet:

Something like:

“The One Who Watched the King.”

Scholar & Warden rep:

Significant Scholar bump.

Wardens:

Slightly mixed, but some appreciate the caution.

Huntmasters:

Split:

Some respect the restraint.

Others mock the “missed mark.”

Axes:

Merciful vs Ruthless:

Strong push toward Merciful.

Cautious vs Reckless:

Cautious tick, particularly if you reined in aggression multiple times.

Lodge-Faithful vs Fringe:

Slight Fringe tick:

You chose personal ethic over classic Lodge “claim the mark” mentality.

Lodge & NPC Reactions:

Ruarc:

Might call you sentimental, but:

Will admit “takes more control than I had at your age.”

Lyss:

Quiet approval; notes how the Verge still “moves differently” where the King roams.

Elgath:

Thrilled with full bestiary entry.

Maera:

Plays neutral on surface:

May quietly ask if you think you did the right thing.

World Effects:

Ragged Verge:

Occasional rare future sighting events:

King seen on ridges.

Tracks crossing your path.

Some encounters:

Slightly altered (wolves behavior around you if they “smell” the King’s path on you, etc.).

Path C – Brutal Overkill
Optional Branch

If design supports a “too far” axis:

Player might:

Corner the King in kill path.

Continue to attack after it’s clearly broken:

E.g., finishing moves when it’s trying to flee or kneel.

Use:

Certain particularly cruel actions (fire while it’s crippled, etc).

Additional Consequences

Strong:

Ruthless shift.

Reckless or Fringe depending on context.

NPCs:

Some hunters:

Start telling the story with a slightly darker tone:

“It wasn’t a Hunt, it was an execution.”

Certain characters:

May be visibly shaken or critical (Isha, Elgath).

This path isn’t “wrong,” but it colors how the game talks about you.
