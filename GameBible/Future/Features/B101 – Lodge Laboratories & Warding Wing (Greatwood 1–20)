B101 – Lodge Laboratories & Warding Wing (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define the physical and systemic heart of:

Alchemy (58)

Corruption & Cleansing (91)

Lodge Reputation & Circles (59)

Early Professions & Research (95, forward ref)

in one coherent space inside the Greatwood Lodge:

The Lodge Laboratories & Warding Wing.

This feature sets up:

The physical layout (rooms, stations, NPCs).

The systems:

Research projects

Warding network maintenance

Corruption sample handling

Alchemy integration

The progression and upgrades for 1–20.

Expansion hooks for later regions and Lodges.

It should feel like:

“The place where the Lodge dissects the Emberwild and tries to keep it from eating everyone.”

High-Level Fantasy

The Warding Wing and Labs are:

A cluster of rooms where:

Alchemists boil down monster parts.

Wardens watch over ward stones and corruption maps.

Scholars argue about what the forest wants.

Functionally, it is:

A hub for research, crafting, and world-state manipulation.

Narratively, it is:

The place where players see:

How seriously the Lodge takes Corruption.

How messy and contested the “science of Emberwild” is.

Greatwood 1–20 implements a small, dense version of this space that will later be mirrored and expanded in other Lodges.

Design Pillars

Space as a System Map

The rooms themselves visually communicate:

What systems exist.

How advanced they are.

Upgrades should be physically visible:

More shelves, more instruments, stronger ward glows.

Research as a Slow Engine, Not a Gacha Slot

Research projects take:

Time.

Resources.

Hunts.

They unlock:

Recipes, perks, information, and new contracts.

No instant “press button, get random bonus” feeling.

Wards as a Concrete, Manipulable Layer

Wards are not lore wallpaper.

They:

Directly interact with ZCL and Corruption patterns (91).

Are maintained, reinforced, and expanded via projects and contracts.

Cross-Circle Ownership

The Wing is jointly used by:

Wardens’ Circle.

Scholars’ Circle.

Supported by Lodge Proper and Huntmasters.

Reputation in those circles changes:

What you see.

What you are trusted with.

Expandable Blueprint

Structure should scale to:

Bigger Lodges.

New research fields.

Endgame corruption experiments.

Physical Layout (Greatwood Wing)

In Greatwood, the Warding Wing branch of the Lodge has four main spaces:

The Alchemical Infirmary

Function:

Entry-level alchemy, basic medical treatment, HCL cleansing (91).

Systems:

Alchemy Station (Tier 1–2).

Basic cleansing rites.

NPCs:

Lodge Medic.

Apprentice Alchemist.

The Research Gallery

Function:

Study of beasts, plants, and minor corruption.

Systems:

Research projects board.

Specimen displays.

Lore unlocks, journals, and codices.

NPCs:

Scholars’ Circle representatives.

Scribes.

The Warding Hall

Function:

Monitoring and maintaining ward stones and the local warding network.

Systems:

Greatwood ward map.

Warden-led cleansing projects.

ZCL overview for key pockets (91).

NPCs:

Warden of Wards.

Ward apprentices.

The Restricted Lab

Function:

Controlled handling of dangerous corruption samples.

Prototypical high-risk experiments.

Systems:

Story-gated access.

Corruption experiments tied to future perks/features.

NPCs:

Fringe Alchemist.

Occasionally a Huntmaster inspector or Lodge officer.

In Greatwood 1–20, the Restricted Lab is only partially open: most of its later functionality is teased, not fully unlocked.

Core Systems

The Wing runs three main systemic pillars, all interconnected:

Research Projects

Warding Network Management

Corruption Sample & Experiment Handling

Alchemy (58) plugs into all three.

1. Research Projects
Concept

Research projects are multi-step tasks that:

Consume:

Reagents.

Hunt trophies.

Corruption samples.

Require:

Time.

Sometimes player actions (field collection).

Produce:

Recipes.

Perks.

New contract types.

Lore and codex entries.

They are initiated and tracked in the Research Gallery.

Basic Flow

Player talks to a Scholar NPC or interacts with a Research Ledger.

They see:

A list of available projects.

Each with:

Requirements.

Estimated time.

Rewards.

Player funds or starts a project by:

Contributing required items and sometimes gold.

Project enters:

An in-world time state (e.g., “completes after next 2 Hunts”).

After conditions are met:

Player returns to claim rewards and see changes in the Wing.

Project Types (Greatwood 1–20)

Bestiary Studies

Focus:

Beasts, corrupted variants, behaviors.

Requirements:

Trophies or parts from specific creatures (from Hunts, 61).

Rewards:

Bestiary codex entries.

Minor combat tips or hints in UI.

Occasional combat perks vs that creature type.

Alchemical Studies

Focus:

New tonics, balms, brews (58).

Requirements:

Rare herbs.

Monster essences.

Rewards:

New recipes.

Yield or potency slight improvements for certain brews.

Example:

“Hollowcap Toxicology”: unlocks a better Hollowroot Soothing Balm variant.

Corruption Field Studies

Focus:

How corruption spread behaves.

Requirements:

Corruption ichor samples from specific ZCL pockets (91).

Completion of relevant corruption Hunts.

Rewards:

Improved Lodge map readings in Warding Hall.

New corruption icons on Hunt Board contracts.

Pre-requisite flags for warding projects.

Lodge Infrastructure Studies

Focus:

Long-term projects that improve the Lodge’s functionality.

Requirements:

Mixed resource bundles:

Timber.

Stone.

Reagents.

Rewards:

Small Alchemy station upgrades.

Infirmary improvements.

Cheaper cleansing rites.

Research Project UI

In the Research Gallery, the Research Ledger UI shows:

Tabs:

Bestiary, Alchemy, Corruption, Lodge.

Project cards:

Name, type, circle sponsor.

Required items and approximate field tasks.

Reward summary and story blurb.

State:

“Available”, “In Progress”, “Completed (Turn In)”.

Players can have:

1–2 research projects active at once in Greatwood.

More slots unlocked via Scholars’ Circle rep (59).

2. Warding Network Management
Concept

The Warding Hall is where:

Ward stones and sigils that protect the Lodge and nearby Greatwood are monitored.

Zone Corruption Levels (ZCL, 91) are visualized.

Ward-based projects and contracts are initiated.

The idea is:

Wards are a set of magical and physical constructs that push back against Corruption. They require constant maintenance, fuel, and knowledge to remain effective.

Warding Map

The centerpiece of the Warding Hall is the Greatwood Ward Map:

A large tabletop or wall map showing:

Key pockets and regions.

Their current ZCL.

Ward lines leading out from the Lodge.

Interactable:

Player can inspect pockets for more detail:

ZCL, recent changes.

Known threats and contracts available nearby.

Ward Stones and Lines

At a systems level:

Ward stones are discrete anchors in the world:

Some visible near the Lodge and along major routes.

Some remote, accessible via specific quests.

Ward lines are:

The conceptual lines connecting stones.

Represent protective influence.

In 1–20:

The player’s main interaction is via:

Ward stones near Greatwood Lodge.

Occasional field ward stones (quest targets).

They see the effects as:

Slightly reduced ZCL or slower creep in covered regions.

Different spawn patterns along warded routes.

Warding Projects

The Warding Hall offers projects similar to research, but explicitly tied to:

Raising, repairing, or expanding the ward network.

Types of warding projects:

Reinforcement Projects

e.g., “Shore Up the North Wards”

Requirements:

And/or:

Stone and timber.

Warding reagents.

Completion of specific corruption contracts.

Effect:

Reduces ZCL in one or more pockets by 1.

Or slows creep timers for a period.

New Ward Line Projects

e.g., “Extend Wards to Hollowroot Fringe”

Requirements:

Field quests to reach and empower a new ward stone.

Protecting Wardens performing the ritual.

Effect:

Adds a new ward line to the map.

Grants mild global buff near that pocket (slightly safer travel).

Experimental Wards

e.g., “Corruption Redirect Test”

Requirements:

Dangerous experiments in the Restricted Lab.

Effect:

Moves ZCL pressure from one region to another.

Often with narrative consequences.

Warding projects are generally sponsored by the Wardens’ Circle, and completing them yields Wardens rep (59).

3. Corruption Sample & Experiment Handling
Concept

The Restricted Lab is a tightly controlled space where:

Hunters deliver:

Corruption ichor.

Mutated tissues.

Strange artifacts.

Scholar-alchemists and Wardens:

Run experiments.

Develop advanced brews and wards.

Trigger story events.

In Greatwood 1–20, this system is heavily gated and used mostly to:

Unlock advanced tier of corruption-related brews (58).

Gate certain corruption story beats (91, 96).

Sample Intake

Flow:

Player completes:

Corruption-heavy Hunts or contracts.

They gain:

Specific “Specimen” or “Sample” items.

Back at the Lodge:

They can deliver these to the Restricted Lab intake desk.

Lab staff:

Logs the sample.

Adds progress toward specific experimental projects.

UI:

A simple “Specimen Log” shows:

Samples turned in.

Running totals/progress toward experiments.

Associated research/warding projects.

Experiments

Experiments are a special sub-type of research/warding projects with:

Higher risk.

Stronger narrative implications.

Types in Greatwood 1–20:

Stabilization Trials

Goal:

Safely store corruption samples without them affecting the Lodge.

Result:

Unlock certain alchemy stabilizers.

Reduce risk of random corruption events in the Lodge.

Purification Trials

Goal:

Extract “pure essence” from corrupted material.

Result:

Unlock recipes like Purge of the Glade and Warden’s Veil (58) in their stronger variants.

Possibly create rare reagents used in later gear or story.

Behavioral Trials (mostly narrative in 1–20)

Goal:

Understand how Corruption affects beasts and humans.

Result:

Codex entries.

Story beats about ethics, risk, and Lodge politics.

Long-term hooks for player perks or scars later.

Experiments are often flagged as:

Sponsored jointly by Scholars and Wardens.

Requiring Lodge Proper approval as they scale.

NPC Roles and Circles

The Wing’s NPCs are key for making the systems feel alive.

At least one major corruption story event triggered here.

Player relationship:

Ideally has:

Rank 2+ Scholars.

Rank 2+ Wardens.

Sufficient Lodge Proper rank to be trusted in this wing.

Integration With Other Systems
Alchemy (58)

The Infirmary is the physical Alchemy hub.

Research projects in the Wing unlock:

New brews.

Stronger variants.

Slight crafting bonuses.

Wording:

Recipes from 58 should reference being learned:

From Medic.

From Fringe Alchemist.

Through specific research projects.

Corruption & Cleansing (91)

Warding Hall:

Displays ZCL from 91.

Warding projects adjust ZCL and creep.

Restricted Lab:

Uses HCL mechanics for narrative (if player enters with high HCL, NPCs react).

Cleansing:

Lodge cleansing rites defined in 91 are physically performed in Infirmary.

Lodge Rep & Circles (59)

Scholars’ Circle:

Controls research project access and count.

Wardens’ Circle:

Controls warding project access and potency.

Lodge Proper:

Gating:

Access to Restricted Lab.

High-level ward decisions.

Rep thresholds:

Should unlock new tiers of projects and privileges in the Wing.

Hunts & Contracts (61)

Many research and warding projects:

Require completion of specific Hunts.

Hunt Board:

Contracts explicitly “for the Labs” or “for the Warden of Wards”.

Returns:

Trophies and samples turned in to Wing NPCs.

Professions & Lodge Projects (95, Forward)

Professions (Herbalist, Forester, etc.):

Provide materials for research and warding.

Lodge Projects:

Larger upgrades (e.g. new wing expansions) might chain through B101.

UI Considerations
In the Wing

Interactable hotspots:

Alchemy Stations.

Research Ledger.

Warding Map.

Specimen Log.

Data screens:

Research Ledger: projects and status.

Warding Map: ZCL, ward lines, pocket details.

Specimen Log: samples turned in and experiments.

Outside the Wing

Simple indicator on Hunt Board contracts:

Small Scholar or Warden icon if relevant to a project.

In the world:

Ward stones with readable inscriptions that reference:

Warden of Wards.

Projects the player has funded.

Tuning and Constraints (Greatwood Slice)

Limit active projects:

1–2 research + 1 warding + 1 experiment max simultaneously.

Costs:

Should feel significant but not grindy:

Roughly equivalent to a few Hunts’ worth of income per substantial project.

ZCL influence:

Warding projects should be meaningful but not trivializing.

Example:

Reinforcing wards might reduce ZCL in one pocket by 1 or increase it elsewhere.

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

The B101 blueprint supports:

Larger regional Lodges with:

Multiple Labs.

Specializations: beast labs, elemental labs, deep corruption labs.

Faction divergence:

Some Lodges may:

Embrace experimental corruption use.

Others focus solely on purification.

Player-facing corruption perks:

Experiments enabling:

Corruption-powered abilities.

Semi-permanent scars and quirks.

Seasonal / global events:

Wards failing or surging due to world meta events.

The key rule:

Future expansions reuse and extend this Wing structure instead of inventing unrelated “magic systems” floating in a vacuum.
