B108 – Professions & Gathering (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define the Professions & Gathering slice for the Greatwood 1–20 band:

What professions exist in early Emberwild.

How gathering nodes and materials work.

How professions feed:

Alchemy (58)

Gear & loot (B107)

Lodge Projects & Upgrades (B102)

Labs & Research (B101)

Hunts & Contracts (59, 61, B103)

Events & Festivals (B104)

What progression a player can reasonably achieve with professions before leaving Greatwood.

This is the starter profession ecosystem, not the full global crafting system.

Design Pillars

Professions Follow the Hunts

You don’t wander off to grind nodes just to grind nodes.

Resources cluster around Hunts, corruption pockets, and Lodge projects.

“Go do your Hunts and events” naturally feeds profession progress.

Fewer, Clear Professions

Early game keeps it tight:

A handful of professions.

Each with a clear fantasy and loop.

Avoid “15 micro-professions” bloat in Greatwood.

Materials Are Story

“Black Sap resin” and “Hollowroot carapace” are lore objects, not just item IDs.

Where you gather something matters and is referenced in:

Dialogue.

Research.

Gear names.

Support, Not Replace, Loot

Professions augment:

Hunts.

Lodge rewards.

They do not become the main way to progress power in 1–20.

The fantasy is: hunter-alchemist-woodsman, not spreadsheet crafter.

Forward-Compatible

B108 defines:

A small set of core professions.

Core material families.

Later regions add:

Advanced tiers.

Specializations.

Profession List (Greatwood 1–20)

We support four core professions in this slice:

Herbalist

Trapper / Skinner

Forester

Cook

Plus a “soft” meta profession:

Field Scribe (tied to Scholars & research, largely passive).

Alchemy (58) is its own major system and consumes Herbalist / Trapper materials rather than being classified as a gathering profession here.

1. Herbalist

Fantasy: You know where the useful plants grow and how not to die eating them.

Role:

Primary gatherer for Alchemy (58).

Contributor to:

Lodge Projects (bandages, salves, infirmary supplies).

Festival dishes and drinks.

Gathering Targets:

Herbs, fungi, mosses, minor magical plants.

Example Greatwood nodes:

Paleleaf – basic healing/soothing herb (edges, low ZCL).

Hollowcaps – mushroom clusters (Hollowroot adjacency).

Embermoss – glow-tinged moss, often near wardstones or mild corruption.

Sapweed – vine/herb around Black Sap Grove edges, used in sap-related brews.

Loop:

Spot herbs in the wild (subtle highlights, especially if Herbalist rank > 0).

Harvest → get small stack of herb items.

Take herbs to:

Alchemy station (58) for brews.

Lodge Projects board (B102) for contributions.

Progression:

Herbalist skill increases as you:

Harvest successfully.

Use herbs in recipes (Alchemy XP can feed Herbalist XP).

Higher skill:

Higher yields per node.

Chance for rare variants (e.g., “Pristine Paleleaf”).

Unlocks some research tasks (“Document plant life in X pocket”).

2. Trapper / Skinner

Fantasy: You turn dead beasts into useful materials instead of just leaving them to rot.

Role:

Provides:

Hides, pelts, bones, fangs.

Glands, essences for Alchemy.

Directly feeds:

Gear crafting (B107: Ridgewood & Hollowroot sets).

Alchemy reagents.

Lodge décor and trophies (B106, in some cases).

Gathering Targets:

Beast carcasses:

Wolves, boars, Hollowroot creatures, apex beasts.

Specific trophy pieces for:

Hunts & contracts.

Loop:

Kill target via Hunts.

Use Trapper tools on corpse:

Choose “Field dress / skin / harvest.”

Get:

Hide, leather, bone, fang, gland, etc.

Take to:

Crafting benches (for gear).

Labs for specimen/research (B101).

Lodge Projects that need hides or leather.

Progression:

Skill ups per successful harvest.

Higher ranks:

Fewer wasted materials.

Chance to extract rare reagents (e.g., “Howler Fang”, “Matron Gland”).

Unlock special Hunts that ask for precise harvests.

3. Forester

Fantasy: You’re as handy with an axe on trees as on enemies; you understand timber, stone, and Lodge building needs.

Role:

Supplies:

Timber, planks.

Minor stone from exposed outcrops (if we want light mining in Greatwood).

Core input for:

Lodge Projects (B102).

Basic gear handles and bows (B107).

Gathering Targets:

Trees & special wood-bearing plants.

Minor stone veins near surface.

Loop:

Identify harvestable trees/rocks (subtle icon or bark/texture difference).

Chop/mine to gather:

timber_basic, timber_oak, plank_fine, etc.

Small stone bundles (stone_block, stone_runed after Warden involvement).

Deliver to:

Lodge Projects:

Roof repair, training yard, wardstone supports.

Basic craft stations for:

Ridgewood weapon handles.

Furniture (B106 decor).

Progression:

Skill levels increase with:

Successful harvesting.

Turning in materials for projects.

Higher levels:

Better yields.

Access to special nodes:

“Old-growth ridgewood”.

“Wardstone-adjacent stone” (more efficient for warding projects).

4. Cook

Fantasy: You’re the one turning all the meat and herbs into hunt-prep meals and Feast food.

Role:

Converts:

Meat, herbs, basic spices → food buffs.

Connects directly to:

Food buff system (rest & pre-hunt meals).

Ember Feast (B104).

Infirmary and social events.

Inputs:

Meat from Hunts (via Trapper).

Herbs from Herbalist.

Common produce/goods from Lodge vendors or contracts.

Loop:

Use cooking fire or Lodge kitchen.

Combine:

Raw meat + herbs + optional special ingredient.

Produce:

Food items that grant:

Hunt buffs (stamina, regen, resist).

Social buff (Feast-day, “Well-Met” style).

Food used by:

Player pre-Hunt.

Lodge Projects (e.g., “Stock the Infirmary”).

Ember Feast tasks.

Progression:

Skill increases:

With successful recipe uses.

When dishes are turned in to Lodge events or projects.

Higher skill:

Unlocks better recipes.

Gives slightly improved durations or extra minor side effects.

5. Field Scribe (Soft Profession)

Fantasy: You’re a hunter who also records what you see, feeding Scholar knowledge.

Role:

Not a full “crafting” profession.

More of a track that:

Adds data and observations.

Ties into research projects (B101).

Feeds Social epithets like “Field-Quill” (B105).

Loop:

Observe:

Beasts, plants, corruption anomalies.

Use Scribe tools (lens, notebook, etc.) to:

Log findings at specific points.

Turn in:

Records to Scholars.

Progression:

“Field Scribe” rank rises with:

Completed bestiary/exploration research.

Benefits:

Better payouts on research contracts.

Unlocks scholar gear / decor / titles faster.

Reach Adept.

Access most Greatwood Alchemy herb-based recipes.

Trapper:

Reach Adept.

Consistently harvest full sets of beast materials & occasional rares.

Forester:

Reach Adept.

Contribute meaningfully to several Lodge Projects.

Cook:

Reach Adept.

Know a small catalogue of hunt-prep and social meals.

Field Scribe:

At least some progress.

Recognized as recording findings (epithets, research bonuses).

Integration With Hunts & Contracts (59, 61, B103)

Professions plug straight into contracts:

Hunt Board (59) includes:

Supply & Support contracts:

“Gather X Paleleaf for the Infirmary.”

“Deliver Hollowcaps for Scholars’ experiment.”

Research & Exploration contracts:

“Document plant distribution in the Ragged Verge.”

“Collect intact carapaces from Hollowroot broodlings.”

Signature Hunts (B103):

Guarantee:

Rare beast parts for Trapper.

Unique reagents for Herbalist from environment.

Often have:

Bonus objectives:

“Return an intact gland for the Lab.”

“Gather sap samples as you track the Devourer.”

Success:

Feeds:

Research projects (B101).

New recipes (58).

Lodge Projects (B102).

Gear crafting (B107).

Integration With Alchemy (58)

Herbalist + Trapper are Alchemist’s best friends:

Many Alchemy recipes explicitly require:

Specific herbs from certain pockets (ZCL-tagged).

Monster essences (Trapper).

Higher Herbalist skill:

Grows supply of rare herbs.

Higher Trapper skill:

Increases chance to extract rare essence types.

Alchemy:

Sits at the center:

Consuming nearly every profession’s output in some way.

Integration With Labs & Warding Wing (B101) & Corruption (91)

Research Gallery:

Constantly requests:

Herbs, samples, beast parts.

Profession output used to:

Start and complete projects.

Warding Hall:

Warding projects require:

Stone, wood, Embermoss, ward inks, etc.

Forester & Herbalist feed these.

Restricted Lab:

More dangerous experiments need:

Black Sap essences.

Corrupted tissues.

Trapper and Herbalist at high skill:

Safely extracting necessary materials.

ZCL (91):

Some materials:

Only appear in pockets of certain ZCL ranges.

Professions:

Encourage hugging the risk/reward edge:

Higher ZCL = rarer herbs or essences.

But more HCL and danger.

Integration With Lodge Projects (B102)

Nearly every project has:

Material requirements that map directly to professions:

Examples:

“Patch the East Roof”:

Forester: timber.

“Expand the Infirmary Ward”:

Herbalist: herbs for balms.

Cook: clean linens / supplies, sometimes as crafted bundles.

“Restore the Old Ward Stone”:

Forester: special stone + timber for scaffolding.

Herbalist: Embermoss or ward-herbs.

“Open the Ember Gallery”:

Trapper & Field Scribe:

Specimens and notes.

Professions:

Turn Hunts into:

Progress on big, visible Lodge upgrades.

Integration With Events & Festivals (B104)

Events tap professions hard:

Ember Feast:

Cook:

Primary business:

Feast dishes, festival recipes.

Herbalist:

Herbs for special drinks & table dressing.

Trapper:

Meat from festival Hunts.

Gloaming Vigil:

Herbalist:

Ward herbs for Vigil rituals.

Forester:

Wood for Vigil fires and ward posts.

Trapper:

Beast parts for protective charms (even if mostly flavor).

Micro-events:

Infirmary Rush, Scribe Exhibitions:

Directly solicit:

Herb bundles.

Specimens.

Written observations.

Integration With Social Systems & Quarters (B105, B106)

Social Epithets:

Players strongly engaged in certain professions can:

Influence epithets:

A heavily Herbalist/Scholar type might lean toward “Field-Quill” or similar.

A Forester-heavy helper may be known as someone “who keeps the Lodge standing.”

Rumors:

NPCs mention:

“They’re the reason the Infirmary never runs dry.”

“If a roof isn’t leaking, likely they had a hand in it.”

Quarters Decor (B106):

Profession-specific decor:

Herb folio (Herbalist).

Gear rack & crates (Trapper/Forester).

Feast barrel / cooking trinkets (Cook).

Tuning & Constraints (Greatwood Slice)

Professions are optional but synergistic:

Players can ignore them and still progress.

But engaging makes:

Hunts smoother.

Lodge feel more “theirs”.

More side content available.

Rate of gain:

Skill levels should rise:

At roughly the pace of natural play (doing Hunts, helping projects).

Grinding should:

Be possible but not optimal:

Diminishing returns from over-farming a single node type.

Node Respawn:

Herbs, wood, and stone:

Respawn slowly enough to avoid degenerate loops.

Encourage exploring new pockets and following Hunts.
