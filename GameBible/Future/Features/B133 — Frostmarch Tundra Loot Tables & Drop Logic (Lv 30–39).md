4. Lua Loot Table Examples (Frostmarch)

These plug into the same LootTables structure we’ve been using.

local function LootEntry(itemId, chance, minCount, maxCount)
    return {
        itemId   = itemId,
        chance   = chance,
        minCount = minCount or 1,
        maxCount = maxCount or minCount or 1,
    }
end
