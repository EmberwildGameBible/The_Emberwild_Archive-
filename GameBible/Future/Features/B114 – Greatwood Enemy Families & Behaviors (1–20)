B114 – Greatwood Enemy Families & Behaviors (1–20)
Purpose

Define the enemy families and combat behaviors for the Greatwood 1–20 slice so that:

Each pocket (B113) feels distinct.

Each Signature Hunt (B103) sits on top of a clear ecosystem, not random mobs.

Status effects & damage types (B109) are used consistently.

Alchemy, gear, and roles (58, B107, B110) have recognizable targets to interact with.

This is not a full stat sheet; it’s the taxonomy + behavior bible.

Design Pillars

Family First

Enemies belong to clear families:

Ridge Beasts, Hollowroot Brood, Black Sap-corrupted, etc.

Each family:

Has recognizable silhouettes.

Shares status / damage profiles.

Ecosystem, Not Zoo

Creatures:

Make sense in their pockets.

Have predator/prey or thematic relationships.

Signature Hunts:

Feel like the apex of a food chain, not disconnected bosses.

Readable Behaviors

Enemies have:

Obvious telegraphs.

Simple “if/then” logic the player can learn.

Complexity comes from:

Combinations, not hidden rules.

Scaling With Corruption

Corruption doesn’t just “color swap” enemies.

It:

Changes their behavior.

Adds or intensifies status effects.

Alters ecosystems in pockets (B91, B109).

High-Level Family List (Greatwood 1–20)

Human / Humanoid Threats (Local) – Poachers, bandits, rogue hunters (sparingly).
