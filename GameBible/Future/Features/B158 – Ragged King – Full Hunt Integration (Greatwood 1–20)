# B158 – Ragged King – Full Hunt Integration (Greatwood 1–20)

## 0. Purpose

Fully define the **Ragged King** as a late Greatwood signature Hunt:

- Narrative role and unlock chain
- Arena layout and encounter phases
- Profession roles (Hunter, Cook, Alchemist, Forager/Woodworker)
- Core + specialty drops (51 / 55)
- Loot behavior aligned with B151
- Lodge/trophy/ritual projects (57)
- Food and brew hooks (52, 53, 58)

This is the single integration hub for Ragged King so you don’t have to cross-reference a dozen files to remember what he is.

---

## 1. Role in Greatwood

**Name:** Ragged King  
**Region:** Charred barrows and bone-strewn clearings at the edge of Greatwood  
**Band:** Late Greatwood capstone (recommended 18–20)  
**Type:** Signature Hunt – ash, bone, and “old war” energy

### 1.1 Narrative Identity

The Ragged King is:

- A towering, half-skeletal, half-charred beast (or beastlike humanoid silhouette) wrapped in burnt hides, broken armor, and **old hunt trophies**.
- His body is:

  - Riddled with **bone fractures** that never heal,
  - Crusted in **ash** from old fires,
  - Laced with faint embers in his ribs and skull.

- He is less a “corruption entity” and more the **leftover anger** of old hunts:

  - The bones of too many beasts taken without balance,
  - The embers of old wars that never quite went out.

Thematically he:

- Sits between **Ashen Beast** and the other Hunts:

  - Uses ash and fire-adjacent themes,
  - But is primarily about **bone, death, and old grudges**.

Mechanically he owns:

- Heavy bone + ashen specialties:
  - `ragged_king_bone_shard` (base)
  - `ragged_king_shank` (base)
  - `spec_ingr_ragged_king_bone_shard`
  - `spec_ingr_ragged_king_shank`
  - `spec_ingr_ragged_king_ashen_fragment` (55, B151)

- Late Greatwood:

  - Bone / marrow stews and ashen roasts (52, 53),
  - Stronger death/ash brews (58),
  - Lodge trophies and “bone throne” / pyre projects (57).

He should **feel** like the last major Hunt before you move beyond Greatwood 1–20.

---

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Recommended Placement

Ragged King should not show up until the player has:

- Fought:

  - At least one corruption Hunt (Matron or Black-Sap),
  - At least one guardian Hunt (Elder Stag or Ward-Bear),
  - One wolf/pack Hunt (Howler).

- Seen enough of Greatwood’s:

  - Bones,
  - Ash scars,
  - Leftover battlefield/old Hunt locations.

He is the **consequences** of all that.

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **“Bonepiles Walk”**
   - Contracts begin describing:

     - Bone piles rearranged overnight,
     - Old kill sites disturbed,
     - Hunters feeling “watched” near ash patches.

   - Player:
     - Investigates three former Hunt sites:
       - Old stag kill,
       - Old bear pit,
       - Abandoned Ashen campsite.
     - Finds bones arranged in rough **crown shapes**.

2. **Ash Among the Bones**
   - Ward or Scholar NPC:

     - Note that the bones are smeared with ash that doesn’t blow away.
     - Mention rumors of “a king of the hunted, walking in the ash.”

   - Player:
     - Sent to a **burned glade** near Ashen Beast territory,
     - Fights skeletal scavenger beasts and bone constructs.

3. **Barrow Signs**
   - Player discovers:

     - A half-collapsed **barrow hill** with toppled stone markers,
     - Scratched names/sigils of long-dead Hunters / Wardens.

   - Clues indicate:

     - Someone or something is gathering bones and trophies here.

4. **Hunt Posting – “The Ragged King”**
   - Board unlocks named Hunt:

     - “Heaped bones, hollow eyes, and embers that will not die. The Ragged King walks. End him, or every old Hunt will rise with him.”

5. **Final Approach**
   - Player is sent to:

     - The **Ragged Barrow** – charred mound and bonefield at Greatwood’s edge.
     - Triggering the Hunt instance.

6. **Aftermath**
   - Once Ragged King is killed:

     - Bone disturbances drop sharply.
     - Ward and Hunt NPCs comment that:

       - “The forest remembers differently now.”
       - “The ash feels… cooler.”

   - Unlocks:

     - Bone/ash Lodge projects,
     - Advanced marrow stews and ash brews,
     - Possibly a cross-region ritual hook.

---

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Layout

The Ragged Barrow arena is:

- A large circular depression around a **central barrow mound**:

  - The mound is ringed with broken stone markers and old trophy-poles.
  - Charred trees lean inward like ribs.

- The ground is:

  - Covered in ash,
  - Littered with **bone piles** and broken weapons,
  - Broken by occasional **magma-like ember vents**.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **Central Barrow Mound**

  - Elevated central platform where Ragged King often starts and returns.
  - Provides:

    - High vantage point,
    - Space for big “ashing” moves.

- **Bonefields**

  - Outer ring of arena:

    - Bone piles,
    - Fallen trophies,
    - Old wagon frames.

  - Breaking or stepping on bone piles:

    - Can trigger bone spike eruptions,
    - Or spawn skeletal adds.

- **Ash Vents**

  - Small fissures emitting warm, faint light.

  - When triggered by:

    - Ragged King’s slam,
    - Or certain abilities,

    they erupt:

    - Ash plumes,
    - Flickering flame,
    - Damage-over-time zones.

---

## 4. Boss: Ragged King – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Ash/Bone Beast (or monstrous war-wight)  
**Fight Length Target:** ~5–8 minutes (late-tier Hunt)

Core themes:

- Bone / ash control,
- Heavy melee with bursts,
- Old-Hunt ghosts / echoes.

---

### 4.1 Baseline Attacks

Used in all phases, scaled:

- **Cleaver Sweep (or Bone Club Sweep)**

  - Broad horizontal sweep with heavy weapon or bone club.
  - High damage, knockback.

- **Ragged Stomp**

  - Local ground slam:

    - Knocks players nearby,
    - Triggers bone piles within radius (spikes or adds).

- **Ash Lash**

  - Short-range lash of ash and embers from his cloak/hide.
  - Applies:

    - Minor fire/ash DoT,
    - Slight vision haze.

- **Bone Toss**

  - Throws a large bone or skull:

    - Impact zone fracturing,
    - Minor AoE damage / stagger.

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 – Crown of Old Hunts

**Trigger:** Start, HP 100% → ~70%

- Focus on:

  - Heavy but simple melee,
  - Teaching bone piles as interactive hazards.

Mechanics:

- **Focused Sweeps & Stomps**

  - King primarily targets:

    - Nearest player,
    - Or one who stays on mound too long.

- **Bone Pile Reactivity**

  - Every Ragged Stomp near bone piles:

    - Pops bone spikes underfoot (line or circle),
    - Or animates tiny skeletal critters.

  - Encourages:

    - Pulling fight off densest bonefields,
    - Respecting positioning.

- **“Crown” Visual**

  - Occasionally:

    - King raises arms or head,
    - Bone piles briefly rattle as if responding,

  - No mechanical effect yet, just telegraph for Phase 2.

Goal:

- Establish the **weight** of the boss and bone hazard language.

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 – Ash and Wakes

**Trigger:** HP around ~70% → ~35%

Ragged King:

- Draws on ash/ember,
- Summons echoes of past Hunts.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Ash Storm**

  - Periodic:

    - Wind picks up ash,
    - Visibility drops.

  - During storm:

    - King gains slight evasion buff,
    - Bone piles are harder to see.
    - Ash plumes spawn at vents:
      - Standing in them deals DoT and slows.

- **Wake of Hunts**

  - The King:

    - Thrusts his weapon or bone shard into the ground.

  - Echoes of old Hunts spawn briefly:

    - Spectral shapes (no full lore detail needed now),
    - As **elite skeletal beasts**:

      - Wolf-wraith,
      - Stag bones,
      - Bear skeleton fragments.

  - They:

    - Charge / slam,
    - Then shatter into bones again.

- **Ash Mantle**

  - Occasionally:

    - King wraps himself in swirling ash.

  - Effects:

    - Reduced ranged damage briefly.
    - Standing too close:

      - Reduces player vision,
      - Applies small fire/corruption tick.

Goal:

- Increase pressure:

  - Movement + add management,
  - Minimal safe space if bonefields/vents are mismanaged.

---

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Shattered Crown

**Trigger:** HP around ~35% → 0%

Ragged King becomes:

- More frantic,
- More brittle,
- More explosive.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Crown Break**

  - At the phase transition:

    - He lets out a roar,
    - A **bone crown** of trophy horns/skulls cracks.

  - Shards:

    - Burst outward as projectiles,
    - Embed in ground as small hazards or loot visuals.

- **Bone Frenzy**

  - King chains:

    - Cleaver Sweeps,
    - Stomps,
    - Ash Lashes,

  - In unpredictable sequences.

  - Bone piles:

    - Get consumed into temporary **bone armor** around him:

      - Extra damage reduction until players strip it by sustained hits.

- **Ash Collapse**

  - As HP gets very low:

    - Ash vents around arena begin to flare more often.
    - Multiple small ash plumes appear:

      - Creating high DoT zones if fight drags.

- **Last Shank**

  - Final ~10–15% HP:

    - King holds his side (where the `ragged_king_shank` cut would be).
    - Damage windows:

      - Brief, when he overcommits on swings,
      - Punish-player-gets-punished if they whiff.

Goal:

- Turn the last portion into:

  - A high-tension dance of:

    - Avoiding bone/ash overflow,
    - Exploiting brief openings.

---

## 5. Specialty Mechanics & Drops

### 5.1 Base vs Specialty Items

From B151 we have:

- Base boss drops:

  - `ragged_king_bone_shard` (base)
  - `ragged_king_shank` (base)

- Specialty variants (55):

  - `spec_ingr_ragged_king_bone_shard`
  - `spec_ingr_ragged_king_shank`
  - `spec_ingr_ragged_king_ashen_fragment`

Think of base items as:

- “Regular but good Hunt loot”,

and `spec_ingr_...` as:

- “Special reagents” for advanced recipes / projects.

---

### 5.2 `spec_ingr_ragged_king_bone_shard`

**Fantasy:**

- A dense, jagged shard from the King’s spine or limbs:

  - Hardened by ages of impacts and ash.

**Mechanic:**

- First kill:

  - Guaranteed 1 x `spec_ingr_ragged_king_bone_shard`.

- Later kills:

  - Chance improved if:

    - Players manage bonefields well:

      - Fewer bone piles detonated,
      - Or if they keep certain “ancestral markers” intact.

Uses:

- Lodge trophies:

  - Bone throne pieces,
  - Massive wall trophy bracing.

- Food/brew:

  - As stock bone for **very potent marrow broths**.
  - As focus for bone/ward ritual drinks (58).

---

### 5.3 `spec_ingr_ragged_king_shank`

**Fantasy:**

- A massive, charred shank of bone and muscle from the King’s leg.

**Mechanic:**

- Conditional drop:

  - Higher chance if:

    - Players **break bone armor** multiple times in Phase 3:
      - Forcing King’s body to crack and expose vulnerable flesh.

- Rare enough to feel:

  - Like a special victory,
  - But not absurdly unobtainable.

Uses:

- Feasts:

  - Late-game Lodge-only roasts & stews with huge buffs but heavy resource cost.

- Rituals:

  - Possibly burned/offered in large fire-based rituals for region effects.

---

### 5.4 `spec_ingr_ragged_king_ashen_fragment`

**Fantasy:**

- A small, ember-glowing piece of ash-crusted bone that refuses to cool.

**Mechanic:**

- Rare drop:

  - Drop chance tied to:

    - Allowing **some** ash vents to flare fully,
    - But not letting the entire arena become lethal.

- Think:

  - “Riding the line” between too much ash and too little.

Uses:

- Alchemy:

  - Very strong ash-based brews:

    - High-risk (side effects) but powerful,
    - Possibly enabling temporary fire/ash immunity or big damage.

- Lodge:

  - As key reagent in:

    - Ash brazier projects,
    - or cross-region rituals.

    - Expands after:

      - First kill,
      - Crafting bone throne / ash pyre.

- **Old Hunts and Ash – Concept Entry**

  - Explains:

    - The idea that:

      - Hunts leave behind more than just meat and gold,
      - Bones and ash remember.

### 10.2 Hunt Board Presentation

Posting should:

- Make it clear:

  - This is an end-tier Greatwood Hunt.
  - Not for under-geared parties.

- Emphasize:

  - Bone / ash,
  - Old wars / old hunts,
  - High reward.

Icons:

---

## 12. Implementation Notes (Future You)

In the Game Bible:

- B158 is the master doc for:

  - Who Ragged King is,
  - What he drops,
  - What systems he feeds.

In data/code (later):

- Ties to:

  - B151 loot for `gw_ragged_king`.
  - Ingredient/specialty defs in 51 / 55.
  - Late-tier recipe grids in 52 / 53 / 58.
  - Trophy/ritual projects in 57.

When implemented:

- Use B158 as checklist:

  - Barrow arena, bonefields, vents built? ✔
  - Phases (bone → ash → shattered) working? ✔
  - Loot yields match base & spec IDs? ✔
  - Lodge projects and food/brews actually consume those reagents? ✔
