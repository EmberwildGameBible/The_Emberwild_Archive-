B132 — ASHEN RIDGE LOOT TABLES & DROP LOGIC (LV 20–29)
1. Ashen Ridge Loot Philosophy

Ashen Ridge is the first real forging zone. Greatwood taught players:

“Gear exists”

“Rares exist”

“World drops exist”

Ashen Ridge teaches:

Zones can have strong identity (fire, stone, metal)

Certain mobs are primary targets for specific stats / roles

Materials here push players into professions & forging

High-level rules for this band:

Coin is higher than Greatwood but still modest.

Materials shift heavily toward metallic + energetic:

Ember Ore, Glowrock, Obsidian, Molten Filament.

Equipment strongly aligned to:

Emberstalker (AGI leather)

Basalt Vanguard (STR heavy)

Pyrechanter (INT/SPI cloth)

Ultra-rare / named weapons unlock distinct build fantasies.

2. Enemy Loot Profiles (Lv 20–29)

Covered here:

Magma Wretch

Igneous Skulker

Charhound

Emberborn Serpent

Obsidian Strider

3. Ashen Ridge World Drop Table (Lv 20–29)

All qualifying mobs (non-critter, Lv 20–29 in Ashen Ridge) roll this table after their regular loot.

Recommended chance:

Normal: ~0.05% per kill

Elites/rares: 0.15–0.25% per kill

This keeps world drops exciting but truly rare.

Candidate World Drops

All of these are tuned slightly stronger than “typical” Rare pieces of the band, but still within reason.

Lv 26 ring

+Primary Stat, +STA, +1% Crit, small fire resistance

Lv 27 cloak

Thematic for DPS or casters; AP or SP plus fire resistance.

Balanced between AP and a small fire DoT.

Ashen World-Drop Staff: Emberwake Conduit

Lv 29 staff

High INT/SP, minor mana-per-5, small chance to add a brief fire damage aura.

You can later promote any of these to “Epic” or “Boss-tier” if you build more rarities.

4. Lua Loot Table Examples

Here’s how these can be represented in pseudo-Lua, mirroring the Greatwood structure.

local COMMON    = "COMMON"
local UNCOMMON  = "UNCOMMON"
local RARE      = "RARE"
local ULTRA     = "ULTRA"

local function LootEntry(itemId, chance, minCount, maxCount)
    return {
        itemId   = itemId,
        chance   = chance,   -- 0.0–1.0
        minCount = minCount or 1,
        maxCount = maxCount or minCount or 1,
    }
end

    },

    ultra = {
        LootEntry("ITEM_EMBERFORGE_HEART", 0.0035, 1, 1),
    },

    worldDrop = {
        LootEntry("ITEM_EMBERWAKE_CONDUIT", 1.0, 1, 1),
    },
}


You can reuse this structure for every Ashen Ridge mob, swapping IDs and chances.
