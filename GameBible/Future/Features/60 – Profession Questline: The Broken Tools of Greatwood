# 60 – Profession Questline: “The Broken Tools of Greatwood”

## Premise

Across the Lodge, tools are **failing**:

- Axes snap in healthy wood
- Cooking pots crack under low heat
- Chisels warp on simple grain

At first it looks like bad craftsmanship or overuse, but the pattern points to something deeper tied to **Greatwood’s resources** and maybe subtle corruption.

This questline:

- Pulls together **Forester, Cook, and Woodworker** professions
- Teaches the player more about Greatwood’s materials
- Ends with upgraded profession tools and understanding of resource “attunement”

---

## Structure Overview

Length: **4–5 quests**, designed to be playable around skill 5–15 in professions.

Suggested quest names (working):

1. **“Splinters and Cracks”** – The problem appears
2. **“Bad Batch”** – Investigating faulty materials
3. **“Wood That Won’t Yield”** – Forester-focused resource checks
4. **“Fire That Bites Back”** – Cook-focused heat/ingredient problems
5. **“Mending the Line”** – Woodworker + player fix the root cause

---

## Quest 1 – “Splinters and Cracks”

**Goal:** Introduce the problem and involve the player.

- **Setup:**
  - Player overhears arguments in the Lodge:
    - A woodworker swearing about a broken chisel
    - A cook furious that a pot cracked mid-stew
  - An NPC (maybe a neutral Lodge facilitator) asks you to help investigate.
- **Objectives:**
  - Talk to:
    - A Forester, a Cook, and a Woodworker about their tool failures.
  - Examine a few broken tools (props, inspection interactions).
- **Reveal:**
  - The failures are recent and clustered, not random.
- **Reward:**
  - Small XP, coin
  - Intro-level profession rep for all three wings

---

## Quest 2 – “Bad Batch”

**Goal:** Test if the problem comes from **supplies** (wood, metals, ingredients).

- **Setup:**
  - NPC suggests: “Maybe a bad batch of supplies came in.”
- **Objectives:**
  - Track where recent tools and pots came from:
    - Check supply logs / talk to quartermaster
    - Inspect a recent shipment of wood or ore
  - Gather sample materials:
    - Wood from normal trees
    - Wood from suspicious patches (near corruption, weird growth)
    - Maybe some cooking clay/metal sources
- **Gameplay:**
  - Basic gathering and talk-to objectives.
- **Reveal:**
  - Some materials are fine; some are subtly “off” despite looking normal.
- **Reward:**
  - XP, coin
  - Small bump in Forester / Carpenter rep

---

## Quest 3 – “Wood That Won’t Yield”

**Goal:** Focus on the **Forester** angle – the trees and forest itself.

- **Setup:**
  - Foresters report new growth patterns and “wrong-feeling” wood.
- **Objectives:**
  - Visit marked trees:
    - Normal Greatwood tree
    - Tree near a corruption pocket
    - Tree near recent wildfire or strange event
  - Chop samples with a temporary “diagnostic” axe.
  - Bring samples back to a Forester NPC and Woodworker to test.
- **Gameplay:**
  - Gathering + light combat if hostile creatures defend certain trees.
- **Reveal:**
  - Certain regions produce wood that is subtly altered:
    - Too brittle
    - Too “springy”
  - Tools fail or warp when used repeatedly with this material.
- **Reward:**
  - XP, coin
  - Forester rep; potential access to a “safe wood” or “treated wood” technique later

---

## Quest 4 – “Fire That Bites Back”

**Goal:** Focus on **Cooking** and heat sources.

- **Setup:**
  - Cooks complain that even low heat is cracking pots.
  - Some fires are burning “weird” (color, smell).
- **Objectives:**
  - Test cooking with different fuel sources:
    - Normal wood
    - Ash-touched wood
    - Corrupted, resin-heavy wood
  - Use a temporary test pot to see how it responds.
- **Gameplay:**
  - Player lights different fires, cooks simple test dishes (or just interacts with stations).
- **Reveal:**
  - Certain woods + certain ingredients create unstable heat or pressure.
  - The combination of *the wrong wood* and *certain tainted ingredients* is overstraining tools.
- **Reward:**
  - XP, coin
  - Ember Kitchen rep
  - Possibly new knowledge/recipe for safely handling risky ingredients (balms, cleansing broths)

---

## Quest 5 – “Mending the Line”

**Goal:** Resolve the mystery and upgrade profession tools.

- **Setup:**
  - The Lodge realizes:
    - New growth patterns and slight corruption are altering Greatwood’s resource “profile.”
    - Old ways of crafting tools and pots aren’t enough anymore.
  - Player is asked to help create **new, adapted tools**.
- **Objectives:**
  - Work with:
    - Forester to select & harvest “stable” wood
    - Cook to identify safe handling for dangerous ingredients (e.g. no mixing with certain fuel)
    - Woodworker to forge/build upgraded handles, shafts, and tool heads
  - Craft or receive:
    - New versions of profession tools:
      - `item_prof_forester_axe_t2` or special variant
      - `item_prof_cook_knife_t2` or sturdy pot upgrade
      - `item_prof_woodworker_tools_t2`
- **Gameplay:**
  - Final round of gathering, crafting, and delivering.
  - Potential short encounter if corruption tries one last time to interfere (optional combat).
- **Resolution:**
  - Lodge stabilizes its tool supply.
  - The player is recognized as someone who understands both the forest and the work.
- **Reward:**
  - Significant XP, coin
  - Larger rep boost in all three wings (59)
  - Unlock/award upgraded tools for each profession (54)
  - Optional title or cosmetic acknowledging the role (e.g. “Line Mender”)

## Integration

- Connects directly to:
  - 51 – Ingredient taxonomy (for “tainted” vs normal ingredients)
  - 54 – Profession tools and gear
  - 55 – Specialty ingredients (some “bad” ones causing issues)
  - 59 – Profession reputation tracks

This becomes the **bridge questline** that explains *why* certain resources need special treatment and *why* your profession gear matters.

## Next Actions

- Write NPC names, personalities, and sample dialogue beats.
- Place the involved trees, fires, and POIs in specific Greatwood sub-areas.
- Ensure final tool rewards line up with the profession progress curve.
