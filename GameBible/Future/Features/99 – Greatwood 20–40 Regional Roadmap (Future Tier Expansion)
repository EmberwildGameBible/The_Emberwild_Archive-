# 99 – Greatwood 20–40 Regional Roadmap (Future Tier Expansion)

## Purpose

Outline a **future expansion layer** for Emberwild:

- Level 20–40 Greatwood content
- New subregions and difficulty bands
- Progression from:
  - Early Greatwood (1–20) into
  - Deeper, wilder, and more corrupted Greatwood (20–40)
- Hooks into:
  - Higher-tier Hunts & Deeds (61, 66)
  - Advanced professions and Lodge infrastructure (59, 84, 95)
  - New dungeon variants (65, 98)
  - Seasonal and political storylines (83, 94, 96)

Goal: give a **clear, modular roadmap** for how Greatwood grows after the initial 1–20 experience so we can build forward without breaking the early game.

---

## High-Level Structure

Greatwood 1–20 focuses on:

- The Lodge core
- Lower/central forest
- Hollowroot Warren intro
- Burn-Scars rim

Greatwood 20–40 expands:

- Further outward and downward into:
  - Wilder outer rings.
  - Deeper Hollowroot layers.
  - More extreme Burn-Scar and Emberfall zones (98).
- Thematically:
  - Shifts from:
    - Learning to live in Greatwood
    - To discovering that Greatwood is larger, older, and more threatened than anyone at the Lodge realized.

---

## New/Expanded Subregions (Concept Layer)

### 1. Outer Hunt-Rim (20–28)

- Geography:
  - Thicker, older forest beyond initial Greatwood loop.
  - Less human presence, few paths.
- Tone:
  - Classic hunt country:
    - Larger, more dangerous beasts.
    - Increasingly strange behavior and track patterns (80, 91).
- Gameplay:
  - New Hunts:
    - Large stag and boar lines.
    - Predator packs with more complex behaviors.
  - Profession:
    - New wood types, herbs, and game meats.
  - Outposts:
    - Small, precarious forward bases (93).

---

### 2. Deep Greatwood Glades (28–35)

- Geography:
  - Hidden inner glades, ancient trees, standing stones.
- Tone:
  - More mystical:
    - Forest feels “aware.”
  - Not pure corruption:
    - Some glades resist it in odd ways.
- Gameplay:
  - Mixed threats:
    - Corrupted beasts.
    - Powerful but non-corrupted apex predators.
  - Secrets:
    - High-density secret caches and lore spots (90).
  - Ritual/Pseudo-Religious Sites:
    - Places where forest’s own “immune system” appears (91).

---

### 3. Lower Hollowroot Network (30–40)

- Expansion of:
  - Hollowroot Warren (65).
- Tone:
  - Deeper fungal roots, larger chambers, weirder formations.
- Gameplay:
  - Tiered dungeons:
    - More complex layouts and boss mechanics.
  - Corruption:
    - Exposure scaling.
    - Advanced cleansing mechanics needed (91).
  - Professions:
    - Rare alchemical reagents.
    - Corruption-themed recipes.

---

### 4. Inner Burn-Scar and Emberfall Nexus (35–40)

- Builds on:
  - Burn-Scar surface.
  - Emberfall Caverns concept (98).
- Tone:
  - High-risk, high-reward heat-corruption hybrid region.
- Gameplay:
  - World boss-level threats.
  - Harsh environmental hazards (hot ground, vents, storms).
  - Deeds that:
    - Decide how far the Lodge will commit to taming or quarantining this zone.

---

## 20–40 Progression Philosophy

### Power Curve and Threats

- Player at 20:
  - Competent hunter, decent gear, some talents.
- Player at 40:
  - Veteran with:
    - Stronger talents (82).
    - Deep profession investment (95).
    - Social standing in Lodge (83, 59).

Threat escalation:

- Enemies:
  - Smarter behaviors, not just more HP.
- Corruption:
  - Stronger, more complex effects, but gated behind clear progression and tools.
- Hunts:
  - Multi-step, multi-region Deeds with world-state implications.

---

## Lodge and Narrative Evolution (20–40)

### Lodge State

- Lodge has:
  - Visibly changed due to 1–20 actions:
    - Upgraded infrastructure (95).
    - New trophies (86).
    - Social scars from earlier crises (94, 96).

New narrative beats:

- External pressures:
  - Other Lodges or powers taking interest in Greatwood.
  - Trade and politics around Greatwood resources.
- Internal tensions:
  - Debates over:
    - How far to expand outposts.
    - Whether to seal deeper Hollowroot or exploit it.

---

## System Layer Hooks

### Hunts & Deeds (61, 66)

20–40 adds:

- Long-form Hunt chains:
  - Cross multiple subregions and dungeons.
- Multi-stage world bosses:
  - Fights that move between surface and dungeon spaces.
- Co-op-focused Deeds (88):
  - Coordinated hunts, expedition defense, large predator drives.

### Professions & Economy (52–59, 84, 95)

20–40 introduces:

- Master-tier recipes.
- Lodge infrastructure mega-projects.
- New economic loops:
  - Trade with other factions.
  - High-level commissions.

### Corruption & Cleansing (91)

Deeper mechanics:

- New corruption types or intensities.
- Persistent corrupted sites to mitigate over multiple Deeds.
- Ritual/ward systems that:
  - Allow partial re-sanctification of zones.

---

## Player Identity & Growth (82, 86)

20–40 is where:

- Hunter identity hardens:
  - Player becomes known for a style (trapper, long-range, corruption-savant, etc.).
- Trophies and Achievements:
  - Display advanced hunts and difficult feats.
- Lodge roles:
  - Player might be invited into:
    - Advisory roles.
    - Command positions for certain hunts.

---

## Expansion Planning Principles

- Each new band (20–28, 28–35, 35–40) should:

  - Add:
    - 1–2 new subregions or dungeon layers.
    - 2–3 new enemy families/variants.
    - 1–2 major Deed chains.
    - 1 new world boss or equivalent.

- Subregions should be:
  - Buildable as independent “chapters”:
    - So we can release them incrementally if needed.

---

## Next Actions

- Choose:
  - Which subregion(s) are first targets for 20–40 (Outer Hunt-Rim or Deep Glades).
- Rough out:
  - Region one-pagers (visual identity, threats, profession hooks, Deeds).
- Map:
  - 20–40 main narrative arc on top of these subregions.
- Identify:
  - Which existing systems need deeper tech support to scale to 40 (corruption, dungeons, group scaling).
