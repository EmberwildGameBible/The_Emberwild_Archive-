# B110 – Combat Roles & Build Archetypes (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define what kinds of hunters you can actually play as in the Greatwood 1–20 band, using:

Damage & status system (B109)

Gear & loot families (B107)

Hunts & Signature Hunts (61, B103)

Alchemy (58)

Corruption & Warding (91, B101)

Professions & Gathering (B108)

Social / rep / circles (59, B105)

This is not a full talent-tree spec; it’s the combat identity layer:

“I am this kind of hunter, and my kit, gear, brews, circle ties, and Lodge reputation all reflect that.”

Design Pillars

Roles Are Soft, Not Hard Classes

No hard class lock; roles are:

Constellations of choices.

Signposted archetypes, not rigid boxes.

A player can drift between:

Warden-ish tank/support.

Huntmaster striker.

Scholar control.

Roles Are Grounded in Lodge Circles

Each primary role is anchored in:

Huntmasters’ Circle.

Wardens’ Circle.

Scholars’ Circle.

Hybrid roles emerge from mixing their tools.

Corruption & Alchemy Are Shared, But Expressed Differently

Every archetype uses:

Food buffs.

At least some brews.

But which brews and how they relate to Corruption is role-defining:

Some resist it.

Some dance with it.

Early Archetypes Are Simple, Later Ones Layer On

Greatwood roles:

Are clear and readable:

“I’m the frontline Warden.”

“I’m the ranged predator.”

Later regions:

Add specializations and weird edge cases.

Core Role Constellations (Greatwood 1–20)

We define 3 primary combat roles + 2 hybrid archetypes for this slice:

Huntmaster Striker – Mobility & single-target damage.

Warden Frontliner – Protection, control, anti-corruption anchor.

Scholar Field Controller – Debuffs, control, brews, weird tools.

Corruption-Edge Hunter (Hybrid) – Aggressive corruption user.

Versatile Woodsman (Hybrid) – Balanced, utility-heavy generalist.

Each is primarily a lens on:

Preferred weapons.

Armor sets.

Trinkets & brews.

Circle alignment.

Typical Hunts & tasks.

1. Huntmaster Striker

“Point me at the thing that needs killing, and keep up.”

Circle & Social

Strong alignment:

Huntmasters’ Circle.

Likely social flavor (B105):

Epithets: “Surehand”, “Storm-Blood”, sometimes “Pack-Keeper.”

Rumors:

Focus on kill count, big apex Hunts, risky contracts.

Typical Gear & Weapons (B107)

Weapon Families:

Ridgewood Hunter gear early → Hollowroot or Devourer pieces later.

Common picks:

Ridgewood Longknife / Handaxe.

Ridgewood Shortbow → Black-Sap or Hollowroot bow variants.

Warren-Stinger Spear (mid-game).

Armor:

Hunter’s Ridge Set:

Light/medium, stamina-friendly.

Later mixing:

Hollowroot pieces for survival in Warrens, if focused there.

Trinkets:

Howler Fang Charm (beast damage).

Hunt tag bundles.

Low concern for anti-corruption trinkets unless they dip into Black Sap zones heavily.

Alchemy & Food (58)

Prefers brews that:

Boost damage, stamina, and uptime:

High-energy stews.

Fortifiers (physical mitigation).

Short-duration burst brews for big openings.

Limited use of:

Heavy cleansing brews (they’d rather not need them; they try to kill fast and get out).

Hunts & Contracts (61, B103)

Favored content:

Mark Hunts.

Predatory beasts.

Signature Hunts:

Greatwood Howler.

Ragged King (if taking the kill route).

Contract preferences:

“High risk, high reward.”

Weaknesses

Susceptible to:

Control (roots, slows).

Corruption attrition if they linger too long in high ZCL pockets without support.

Mental/corruption resilience:

Usually average unless they commit to Wardens for backup.

2. Warden Frontliner

“Stand behind me. If something reaches you, we have bigger problems.”

Circle & Social

Strong alignment:

Wardens’ Circle.

Social flavor (B105):

Epithets: “Stonebound”, sometimes “Edge-Walker.”

Rumors:

Focus on Vigil, ward projects, “the one who does the grim jobs.”

5. Versatile Woodsman (Hybrid)

“I chop wood, I skin beasts, I mend fences, I kill monsters. Same hands.”

This archetype is the professions-heavy, all-rounder:

Balanced investments in:

Huntmasters, some Wardens, maybe some Scholars.

Strong in:

Gathering and supporting Lodge Projects (B102).

Surviving, not specializing.

Identity

Social:

Epithets might be:

Less formal, more “workhorse”:

(● = actively avoids)

How Players Shift Roles Over Time

Roles are not locked; they emerge from:

Gear choices (what you equip).

Circle rep & quests (what you do).

Alchemy patterns.

Profession focus.

Examples:

A Huntmaster Striker who starts taking corruption Hunts, learns Warden brews, and wears more Ward-etched gear:

Drifts toward Warden Frontliner or a hybrid.

A Scholar who gets obsessed with Black Sap gear and high-risk experiments:

Drifts toward Corruption-Edge Hunter.

A Versatile Woodsman who joins major Vigil duties and ward projects:

Drifts toward Warden Frontliner, but with strong Lodge/project identity.

The Greatwood 1–20 experience should allow:

1–2 clear paths you’ve begun, not your final “class.”
You leave Greatwood with a strong identity but plenty of room to evolve.
