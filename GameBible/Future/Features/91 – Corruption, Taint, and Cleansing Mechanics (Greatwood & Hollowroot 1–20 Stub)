# 91 – Corruption, Taint, and Cleansing Mechanics (Greatwood & Hollowroot 1–20 Stub)

## Purpose

Define the **early framework** for:

- Corruption / taint as a world-state and gameplay force
- How it appears in Greatwood and Hollowroot (65)
- How it affects:
  - Creatures & bosses (66, 80)
  - Environments & hazards (81)
  - Player status (Resolve stat – 71)
  - Professions (Alchemy, Cooking, Forester – 52–59)
- How players **manage, mitigate, or cleanse** corruption in Greatwood 1–20

Goal: introduce corruption as a **slow, creeping threat** and a long-term pillar without overwhelming early gameplay.

---

## Core Concept

“Corruption” in Emberwild is:

- A **spiritual + biological taint** manifested through:
  - Twisted growths.
  - Diseased beasts.
  - Hollowroot infestations.
- It is not:
  - Just “purple goo.” It’s integrated into:
    - Roots, spores, ash, and strange light.

At 1–20, corruption is:

- Mostly **localized** (Hollowroot Warren, certain glades).
- More about **atmosphere, targeted mechanics, and foreshadowing** than full world takeover.

---

## Types of Corruption (Early Pass)

1. **Hollowroot Corruption**
   - Fungal, root-based.
   - Seen in:
     - Hollowroot Warren (65).
     - Nearby surface pockets.

2. **Ash-Touched Corruption**
   - Burn-scar + corruption hybrid.
   - Seen in:
     - Burn-Scar glades.
     - Certain beasts (Ash-Touched boar, etc.).

3. **Spiritual / Ambient Corruption (Stub)**
   - Less visible; felt as:
     - Whispers.
     - Emotional pressure.
   - Mostly future content hook, light hints at 1–20.

## Player-Facing Mechanics

### Corruption Exposure (Light 1–20 Model)

Simple early metric:

- **Corruption Exposure** – a temporary, decaying value:
  - Increases when:
    - Standing in corrupted patches.
    - Hit by corrupted beast attacks.
    - Interacting with heavily tainted objects.
  - Decays slowly over time when:
    - In clean environments.
    - Resting at a camp or Lodge (77, 70).

Effects at early tiers:

- **Low Exposure:**
  - Mostly flavor:
    - Mild visual/audio distortions.
    - Codex/Game Bible hints.
- **Moderate Exposure:**
  - Small debuffs:
    - Slight reduction in stamina regen.
    - Minor penalty to Resolve (71).
- **High Exposure (edge of 1–20 scope):**
  - Stronger temporary debuff:
    - Increased damage taken from corrupted sources.
    - Chance for periodic minor stagger/vertigo effect.

No permanent character-state corruption in 1–20; keep it manageable.

---

### Resolve Interaction

Resolve (71):

- Represents:
  - Mental/spiritual fortitude.
- Role vs corruption:
  - Higher Resolve:
    - Slows buildup of Exposure.
    - Reduces severity of corruption debuffs.
- Early game:
  - Resolve is lightly used:
    - Mostly in Hollowroot/dungeon content and specific corrupted Hunts.

---

## Environmental Corruption

### Corrupted Ground & Growths

- Visuals:
  - Twisted roots.
  - Glowing fungi.
  - Sickly light.
- Mechanical effects:
  - Standing in corrupted ground:
    - Slowly raises Exposure.
    - May deal minor HP chip damage over time.
- Interactions:
  - Certain alchemical harvests:
    - Require stepping into or near corrupted zones.

### Corruption Nodes (Future Hook)

- Root clusters, heart pods, or fungal cores.
- When destroyed:
  - Temporarily cleans small area.
  - Reduces ambient Exposure buildup nearby.
- In Greatwood 1–20:
  - Small-scale “nodes” primarily appear in Hollowroot Warren.

---

## Corrupted Creatures

### Traits

- Increased aggression.
- Different behavior patterns (80):
  - Less fear or altered flight responses.
- Attacks:
  - Apply small chunks of Exposure on hit.
  - Some create corrupted ground patches.

### Examples

- **Ash-Touched Boar**
  - Charges leave scorched, tainted patches.
- **Hollowroot Stag Variant**
  - Antlers and hooves pulsing with fungal growth.
  - Leaves faint corrupted prints in dungeon floors.

### World Bosses / Deeds (66)

- Certain Deeds:
  - Explicitly mark target as corrupted.
- Boss arenas:
  - Mix normal and corrupted ground zones.
  - Encourage players to manage positioning vs Exposure.

---

## Cleansing & Mitigation

### Lodge & Ember Pot (70, 85)

- Lodge:
  - Safe zone:
    - Exposure decays faster.
  - Eventually, services:
    - Spiritual cleansing rituals (story, future expansions).

- Ember Pot:
  - “Comfort” and hearty food:
    - Give small temporary resistance to minor corruption effects.
  - Later:
    - Special recipes tuned specifically to corruption resistance.

### Camps (77)

- Ordinary camps:
  - Provide slow Exposure decay while resting.
- Enhanced camps:
  - With certain structures or alchemical items:
    - Faster decay.
    - Temporary resistance buff.

### Alchemy (58)

Tonics and balms:

- **Corruption-Resistant Tonic**
  - Reduces rate of Exposure gain for a duration.
- **Purge Brew** (limited)
  - Clears a chunk of Exposure when consumed.
  - Comes with:
    - Side effects (nausea, lowered stamina temporarily).

Ingredients:

- Hollowroot fungi.
- Storm-caught fish oils (78).
- Special herbs.

### Forester & Ritual Sites (Future Hooks)

- Foresters:
  - Know places where the forest “fights back” against corruption.
- Small shrines or groves:
  - Visiting and performing simple actions there:
    - Temporarily boosts Resolve.
    - Helps reduce Exposure.

---

## Narrative & Lore Integration

- Codex entries (69):
  - Document:
    - History of previous corruption surges.
    - Stories of hunters lost to taint.
- Lodge politics (83):
  - Debates over:
    - How to handle Hollowroot.
    - Whether to weaponize aspects of corruption (dangerous idea).
- Quests:
  - “Ash in the Pot”-style arcs (56, 85) exploring contamination in food systems.
  - Hollowroot Deeds (65, 66) focusing on containment.

---

## Player Feedback

- UI:
  - Minimal:
    - A small icon or subtle vignette that intensifies with Exposure.
    - Avoid MMO-style giant “Corruption Meter.”
- Audio:
  - Low whispers, droning tones.
  - Slight muffling of ambient forest sounds at higher Exposure.
- Visual:
  - Occasional brief distortions:
    - Edges of screen warping gently.
    - Color shifts.

All effects must be:

- Tuned carefully to avoid discomfort.
- Optionally reducible via accessibility settings.

---

## Integration With Other Systems

- **Weather & Hazards (81):**
  - Certain weather patterns:
    - May temporarily increase corrupted activity (fog/storm near Hollowroot).
- **Dungeons (65):**
  - Hollowroot Warren:
    - Primary testbed for 1–20 corruption mechanics.
- **Talents (82):**
  - Resolve-related perks lightly improve corruption tolerance.
- **Trophies & Deeds (86):**
  - Special trophies for major corruption-related kills.
  - Achievements tied to:
    - Cleansing certain nodes.
    - Surviving high Exposure events.

---

## Next Actions

- Decide:
  - Exact Exposure thresholds and debuff values for 1–20.
- Implement:
  - 1–2 corrupted ground types.
  - 2–3 corrupted beast variants for Greatwood/Hollowroot.
- Design:
  - 2 small cleansing/mitigation items (tonic + food).
  - A basic Hollowroot corruption-focused Deed for testing.
