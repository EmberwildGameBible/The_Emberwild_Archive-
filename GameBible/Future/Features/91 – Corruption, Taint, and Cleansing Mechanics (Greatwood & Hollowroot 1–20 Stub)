91 – Corruption & Cleansing (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define a playable, first-slice version of Corruption in Emberwild for the Greatwood 1–20 band, including:

What Corruption is (fiction + mechanics).

How it affects:

The world (terrain, spawns, density, difficulty).

The hunter (mental state, debuffs, long-term risk).

Hunts, dungeons, and professions.

How players push back:

Cleansing actions.

Alchemy and rituals.

Lodge infrastructure.

This is not the full global/endgame corruption system yet. It’s the Greatwood prototype that must be fun, readable, and scalable.

Core Fantasy

Corruption is the sickness of Emberwild:

It twists:

The land (dark sap, warped trees, bleeding stone).

The wildlife (mutations, erratic behavior, new attack patterns).

Human minds (whispers, paranoia, hallucinations).

It slowly pushes back against hunter activity:

Areas you ignore get worse.

Hunts in corrupted zones are more dangerous, but more rewarding.

Hunters don’t “erase” corruption; they manage and redirect it.

In Greatwood 1–20, Corruption should feel like:

“A creeping disease at the forest edges that you can push back for a while, but never fully cure.”

Design Pillars

Tangible But Trackable

Corruption must be visible and readable in the world:

Visual markers, UI pips, enemy variants.

Players should always understand:

“This place is relatively safe” vs “We are deep in it.”

Risk–Reward Driver

More corruption = more:

Rare spawns, essences, and loot.

Dangerous affixes, environmental hazards.

Useful for:

High-risk hunts.

Alchemy ingredients (58).

Late-Greatwood story beats.

Local First, Global Later

1–20 focuses mostly on local corruption pockets:

Glades, groves, dens, dungeon wings.

Global corruption meta (world map state) is hinted at but not fully online.

Cleansing Is Meaningful Work

Cleansing a pocket:

Feels like a mini-event, not a button press.

Has visible aftermath.

Buys time and space; doesn’t reset everything globally.

Key Concepts

We define four main concepts:

Zone Corruption Level (ZCL)

A rating for a small region (e.g., “North Hollowroot Fringe”).

Ranges from 0 to 5 in Greatwood:

0 = Clean

1 = Tainted

2 = Blighted

3 = Warped

4 = Overgrown

5 = Riven (max for this slice)

Each step bumps:

Spawn tables.

Visuals.

Encounter modifiers.

Local Corruption Nodes

Concrete in-world “anchors”:

Corrupted trees, crystal growths, fungal hearts, ichor wells.

Destroying or cleansing them:

Lowers ZCL or slows its rise.

Feeds progression / quests.

Hunter Corruption Load (HCL)

A personal meter per hunter:

Tracks how long they’ve been in corrupted zones, what they’ve touched, what debuffs they’ve taken.

Low (0–25): Mild visual/audio hints.

Medium (26–60): Debuffs, occasional hallucinations.

High (61–100): Severe effects, risk of permanent scars/conditions (narrative hooks, not necessarily permanent stat losses in 1–20).

Cleansing Actions

Bundled into three categories:

Immediate cleanses (e.g., Cleansebrew, bandages, Lodge infirmary treatment).

Ritual cleanses (Purge of the Glade, campside rites).

Structural cleanses (destroying nodes, Lodge projects).

Zone Corruption Level (ZCL) – Detail
ZCL Effects Table (Greatwood)

For each ZCL tier, define:

Visuals

Spawn Behavior

Ambient Effects

Rewards

ZCL 0 – Clean

Often tied to major story or dungeon events.

Ambient:

Severe, scripted hallucinations and set pieces.

Rewards:

Unique items, key essences.

Quest-critical drops.

Zone Corruption Dynamics
How ZCL Changes

ZCL is driven by three main factors:

Time & Neglect

Many pockets slowly drift upward if left alone:

E.g., every in-game day, some zones have a chance to increase ZCL by 1.

Named “creep timers” per pocket.

Events & Bosses

Certain bosses or events:

Increase corruption if ignored.

Reduce it when defeated.

Example:

A corrupted beast roams the edges; if players don’t hunt it in time, nearby pockets tick up.

Player Actions (Cleansing / Feeding)

Destroying nodes, completing rituals:

Reduces ZCL or dampens its growth.

Sometimes players can choose to “harvest” instead of cleanse:

Gain extra resources but increase ZCL.

Hunter Corruption Load (HCL) – Detail
Sources of Corruption

HCL increases from:

Time spent in zones with ZCL > 0 (rate scales with ZCL).

Taking certain debuffs:

Corruption poison, madness, ichor burns.

Interacting with:

Corruption nodes.

Certain alchemy experiments gone wrong.

Using forbidden / high-risk powers in future systems (not fully implemented in Greatwood).

HCL Bands & Effects

We treat HCL as 0–100. Effects are banded:

0–25: Touched

Effects:

Mild audio whispers.

Very occasional HUD flicker.

Gameplay:

No mechanical penalties yet.

Cleansing:

Quickly reset by resting at Lodge or using basic brews.

26–60: Strained

Effects:

Periodic mild debuffs:

Brief -5% accuracy.

Tiny max health dips in strong pockets.

Occasional short hallucinations:

A non-existent enemy flickers in the corner of vision.

Gameplay:

Social: some NPCs notice something is off (dialogue lines).

Cleansing:

Requires stronger or multiple cleanses:

Lodge infirmary treatment.

Moderate alchemy (Warden’s Veil, Cleansebrew).

Ritual cleanse at campfire.

61–100: Frayed

Effects:

Significant periodic debuffs:

Short panic/fear procs in high ZCL zones.

Heavy visual distortion in corrupted events.

Potential narrative flags:

The Lodge records your state.

Gameplay:

Hunters at high HCL risk:

Temporary lockout from certain story steps until cleansed.

Taking additional corruption might trigger a “break” event (scripted).

Cleansing:

Must combine:

Lodge ritual treatment.

Rare reagents or special quests.

After cleansing, some narrative residue may remain (scars, dreams, minor perks or quirks later in the game).

Cleansing Methods

We break cleanses into three functional categories:

1. Immediate Cleanses (Combat / Field)

Examples:

Cleansebrew Tonic (58):

Removes one stack of poison/bleed/disease, slightly chips away at HCL.

Basic field “purge bandages”:

Clears a specific corruption debuff.

Rules:

Short cooldowns.

Mostly targeted at status effects, with small HCL relief.

Limited effect on ZCL (zone stays corrupted).

2. Ritual Cleanses (Camp & Lodge)

These are structured, small “moments”:

Purge of the Glade (58):

Used at a campfire in moderate-to-high ZCL zones.

Creates a Purified Ground buffer:

Slightly reduces local ZCL.

Creates a safe bubble around camp.

Lodge Cleansing Rites:

Resting in certain Lodge rooms with:

Alchemical baths.

Wards and incense.

Reduces HCL heavily, minor impact on ZCL in nearby pockets.

Rules:

Require:

Special reagents (ichor, rare herbs, salts).

Sometimes multiple hunters participating.

Tradeoffs:

Consumes resources that could be sold or used for crafting.

Sometimes inflicts temporary debuffs (drained, exhausted).

3. Structural Cleanses (Nodes & Projects)

These affect ZCL at its root:

Destroy corruption nodes:

Fungal hearts, sap pools, corrupted crystals.

Usually defended by elites or small encounter waves.

Complete Lodge projects:

“Reinforce Greatwood wards.”

“Erect new warding stones along the North ridge.”

Results:

Step-downs in ZCL for specific pockets.

Slower creep timers for whole segments of the forest.

World Integration: Greatwood 1–20
Corruption Pockets in Greatwood

Greatwood has several named pockets, each with:

Starting ZCL.

Max ZCL for 1–20.

Node types.

Tied content.

Example pockets (you can rename to match existing map docs):

The Hollowroot Fringe

Start: ZCL 1

Max: ZCL 3

Nodes:

Fungal hearts, spore pillars.

Content:

Tutorial corruption events.

Early Cleansebrew questlines (58).

Hollowroot Warren entrances (65).

The Black Sap Grove

Start: ZCL 2

Max: ZCL 4

Nodes:

Bleeding trees, ichor pools.

Content:

Mid-tier corrupted beasts.

Warden’s Veil questline.

First appearance of Riven fractures (scripted).

The Ragged Verge

Start: ZCL 0

Max: ZCL 2

Behavior:

Slowly corrupts over time if certain hunts are ignored.

Content:

Demonstrates creep clearly to new players.

Pale Glaive Ruins (Dungeon-adjacent)

Start: ZCL 3

Max: ZCL 5

Content:

Story dungeon wing.

Early “Riven” event at 5 (scripted spike, not random).

Hunts & Dungeons
Hunts (61)

Corruption ties directly into hunts:

Each hunt contract has a corruption tag:

Uncorrupted, Tainted, Warped, Riven-touched.

Effects:

Corrupted hunts:

Scale enemy stats and add affixes.

Increase reward weights:

More essences.

Higher chance of special drops or alchemy reagents.

Meta:

Some hunts require going into highly corrupted areas:

Special monster variants only spawn at ZCL ≥ 3.

Dungeons (65, 77, etc.)

Dungeon wings have:

Local corruption density, independent but related to their above-ground pocket.

“Safe” wings vs “Deep corruption” wings:

Safes:

Primarily standard enemies, light corruption.

Deep:

Heavy hallucinations.

Environmental corruption hazards.

Bosses (mini and major):

Often act as dynamic ZCL levers:

Killing a boss might drop the overworld pocket ZCL by 1.

Leaving a boss alive might let it “pulse” corruption over time.

Lodge, Story, & NPCs (59, 94, 96)
Lodge Systems

The Lodge treats Corruption as:

A tracked threat level in reports.

A source of:

Research.

Contracts.

Political tension with other factions.

Hooks:

Lodge Reputation:

Cleansing pockets and treating corruption cases increases trust with certain Lodge circles.

Professions:

Herbalists and alchemists get unique jobs:

Sample collection runs.

Ward maintenance.

Story Arc (Greatwood Slice)

At 1–20, Corruption’s story arc should:

Introduce:

Corruption as a known, ancient threat, not a new apocalypse.

Show:

It is worsening in certain pockets.

Give:

The player concrete, mechanical ways to push back:

Cleanses, nodes, hunts.

Leave:

Bigger questions unresolved:

Why it’s intensifying now.

What’s behind the deepest Riven pockets.

NPC examples:

The Warden of Wards:

A tired veteran responsible for ward stones.

Gives structural cleanse quests.

The Fringe Alchemist:

The one referenced in 58 for corruption brews.

Flirts with dangerous experiments.

UI & Feedback
Minimal UI, Heavy Diegesis

Zone UI:

Small corruption icon near minimap:

Pips or Roman numerals I–V for ZCL.

Hunter HCL UI:

Thin bar or gauge near the health/stamina cluster.

Only shows numbers if hovered / inspected; normally just banded state.

FX & Audio:

Visual layers for:

Zone intensity.

HCL bands.

Audio layers (whispers, distant roars) scale with:

ZCL.

HCL.

Tuning Guidelines (Greatwood Slice)

Target:

A normal player can’t ignore corruption forever.

ZCL:

Most “common path” play should experience:

ZCL 1–3 frequently.

ZCL 4 occasionally.

ZCL 5 in curated story moments.

HCL:

HCL 0–25: the norm between hunts.

HCL 26–60: “I’ve been pushing hard; I should consider cleansing.”

HCL 61+: only for players who:

Stay too long in deep corruption.

Chase rewards with minimal cleansing.

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

This foundation must support:

Regional variation:

Different corruption “flavors” (sap, frost, sand, deep sea).

Player-side corruption powers:

Forbidden perks that trade sanity/health for big damage or utility.

Global corruption tides:

World map biomes waxing/waining with seasonal or story events.

Endgame activities:

Corruption storms, invasions, corrupted raids.

But Greatwood 1–20 sticks to the above structure: clear, readable ZCL/HCL, meaningful but manageable threat.
