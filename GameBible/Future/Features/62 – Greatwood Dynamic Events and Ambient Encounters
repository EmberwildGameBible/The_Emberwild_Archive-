# 62 – Greatwood Dynamic Events & Ambient Encounters

## Purpose

Define a **library of dynamic events and ambient encounters** for Greatwood that:

- Make the forest feel **alive and reactive**
- Create memorable moments between structured content (quests, dungeons, hunts)
- Tie into existing systems (Hunt Board, professions, ingredients, reputation)

This is a design catalog + ruleset, not implementation.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Low-friction, high-flavor**  
   Encounters shouldn’t always require prep; they just *happen* as you roam.

2. **Varied intensity**  
   Mix:
   - Tiny vignettes (no combat, just color)
   - Small combat encounters
   - Occasional bigger setpieces (but still lighter than full dungeons)

3. **System hooks**  
   Events should:
   - Use ingredients (51, 55)
   - Feed into Hunts/Deeds (61)
   - Touch professions (forester, cook, woodworker, alchemy)

4. **Replayable patterns**  
   Events should be parametrized enough to rerun with variation.

---

## Event Categories

1. **Ambient Life**
2. **Help/Rescue**
3. **Corruption & Weirdness**
4. **Resource Surprises**
5. **Travel Hazards**
6. **Micro-Social Lodge Touches**

## 1. Ambient Life Events

Small, mostly non-combat scenes that make the world feel alive.

### Example: “Stag in the Mist”

- Trigger:
  - Early morning in forest clearings, light fog.
- Behavior:
  - A non-hostile stag appears, grazes, reacts to player distance/noise.
- Outcomes:
  - If approached slowly, player can observe and maybe:
    - Gain a tiny tracking XP boost
    - See “ideal shot” tutorial hint
  - If spooked and killed:
    - Normal loot, but breaks the quiet moment.

### Example: “Flock Scatter”

- Trigger:
  - Near roads or clearings.
- Behavior:
  - A flock of forest birds scatters if startled; small, pretty event.
- Outcomes:
  - Potential small loot: dropped feathers
  - Might foreshadow predator presence nearby (wolf spawns)

---

## 2. Help / Rescue Events

Short scenarios where the player can choose to intervene.

### Example: “Trapped Forester”

- Trigger:
  - Specific Greatwood subzones with logging/scouting presence.
- Behavior:
  - A Forester NPC is pinned under a log or caught in a trap.
- Objectives:
  - Free them (interaction or simple tool use)
  - Optionally fend off a nearby hostile creature.
- Outcomes:
  - Small XP and coin
  - Forester rep
  - Chance to be pointed toward a Hunt Board contract or Forester quest (61, 59)

### Example: “Lost Novice Hunter”

- Trigger:
  - Deeper into Greatwood, near dangerous areas.
- Behavior:
  - A nervous, under-geared hunter is off-track and scared.
- Objectives:
  - Escort them back to a safe route or camp
- Outcomes:
  - XP, small Lodge rep
  - They might later appear at the Lodge with new dialogue

---

## 3. Corruption & Weirdness

Events that show Greatwood’s darker side.

### Example: “Roots that Bleed”

- Trigger:
  - Near subtle corruption pockets.
- Behavior:
  - Tree roots are visibly red-black, seeping strange fluid.
- Objectives:
  - Player can inspect, harvest a sample, or burn it.
- Outcomes:
  - Sample → minor alchemical ingredient (dangerous)
  - Burn → small rep with Forester’s Circle (they appreciate containment)
  - Ignoring it → no immediate effect, but corruption might spread later (foreshadowing)

### Example: “Whispering Hollow”

- Trigger:
  - Night, near Hollowroot-adjacent areas.
- Behavior:
  - Faint whispers/voices heard around certain trees or stumps.
- Objectives:
  - Follow the whispers → leads to a minor corrupted creature encounter or a lore object.
- Outcomes:
  - XP, possible ingredient (55: `spec_ingr_hollowroot_resin` or `deep_glow_spores`)
  - Lore snippets about past hunts or forest tragedies

---

## 4. Resource Surprises

Positive little spikes for gatherers and profession players.

### Example: “Rich Foraging Patch”

- Trigger:
  - For players with certain profession skills, chance to spot special nodes:
    - Extra mushrooms, herbs, or rare plants.
- Behavior:
  - Small cluster of higher-yield resource nodes.
- Outcomes:
  - More ingredients in one spot
  - Potential rare spawn if over-harvested (beast shows up angry)

### Example: “Old Hunter’s Cache”

- Trigger:
  - Found in off-path locations, maybe marked by subtle signs.
- Behavior:
  - Hidden stash with:
    - small bundle of crafted arrows
    - dried meats
    - maybe a low-tier recipe scroll
- Outcomes:
  - XP, items, flavor note from unknown hunter
  - Potential link to Deeds or Hunt Board (61) older contracts

---

## 5. Travel Hazards

Light risk while moving between POIs.

### Example: “Fallen Tree Ambush”

- Trigger:
  - On certain paths after a storm.
- Behavior:
  - Tree blocks path; player chooses to go around or clear it.
  - Clearing may trigger:
    - Hostile creatures hiding behind/within it
- Outcomes:
  - XP, small resource gain (wood, mushrooms)
  - Chance for a Hunt Board prompt to appear: “Report the blockage” → small rep.

### Example: “Sudden Fog”

- Trigger:
  - Weather system or timed event.
- Behavior:
  - Thick fog rolls in, reducing visibility.
- Outcomes:
  - Optional:
    - Temporarily increased chance of certain rare spawns
    - Decreased range of vision for both player and enemies
  - Hooks into night/fog hunts and tracking quests.

## 6. Micro-Social Lodge Touches

Events that connect the world back to the Lodge.

### Example: “Returning Caravan”

- Trigger:
  - Near roads leading to the Lodge.
- Behavior:
  - Small caravan of traders/hunters moving toward or away from Lodge.
- Outcomes:
  - Quick trade opportunity (limited wares)
  - Chance to overhear rumors that hint at Hunts, Deeds, or Dungeons.

### Example: “Lodge Messenger”

- Trigger:
  - Out in the field, low chance.
- Behavior:
  - A Lodge runner catches up to player with a message:
    - New Hunt posted
    - Deed available
    - Festival or Lodge event starting soon
- Outcomes:
  - Directs player to Lodge / Hunt Board (dynamic hook)
  - Makes the world feel organized and reactive

---

## System Rules & Hooks

- Events are tagged with:
  - **Biome** (forest, river, road, cliff, lodge-adjacent)
  - **Time of Day** (day, night, dawn, dusk)
  - **Weather** (clear, foggy, storm)
  - **Player State** (on a hunt, not on a hunt, near objective, etc.)

- Some events:
  - Are more likely when player has certain profession skills or reputation.
  - Can escalate into Deeds or feed into main questlines.

---

## Next Actions

- Build a **catalog** of at least:
  - 15–20 ambient events
  - 5–10 help/rescue/resource events
- Tag each event with:
  - Specific locations / region zones
  - Time/weather requirements
  - Hook(s) into Hunts, Professions, or Dungeons
- Draft example in-game text/snippets for 3–5 events (flavor, barks, notes).
