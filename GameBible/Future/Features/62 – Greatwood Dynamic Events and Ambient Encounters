62 – Greatwood Hunt Board & Deeds System

# Purpose

Lock in the **Greatwood Hunt Board** and **Deeds system** as a concrete, repeatable content loop for Emberwild’s Greatwood 1–20 slice.

This file assumes:

- 61 – Hunts, Targets, and the Core Hunt Loop defines the abstract rules.
- This file defines the **actual contracts**, **named Deeds**, and how they plug into:
  - Lodge reputation tracks
  - Ingredients and professions
  - Trophies and Lodge/room displays

---

# Design Goals

1. **Player identity as a hunter**
   - The board should always have something that feels like a real, grounded problem in the woods.
2. **Predictable scaffolding, surprising details**
   - The player learns the categories (Culling, Track & Kill, Defense, Investigation, Deeds).
   - What changes: location, twists, and stakes.
3. **Low friction, high flavor**
   - Grab Hunts fast, turn them in fast.
   - Content lives in the world, with strong POI ties.
4. **Scales forward**
   - The Greatwood implementation becomes the “Region 1 template” that later regions mirror.

---

# 1. The Greatwood Lodge Hunt Board

## 1.1 Physical Object & Placement

- Large wooden board in the **main hall** of the Greatwood Lodge.
- Positioned close to:
  - The Ember Pot hearth / cooking area
  - The council desks / Clerk NPC
- Visual language:
  - Layers of curled parchment
  - Wax seals and stamped Lodge sigils
  - Knives, arrows, and bone pins used as tacks
  - A few recent trophies leaning nearby (fresh pelt, cracked horn)

## 1.2 Interaction Basics

- Interact key → **Hunt Board UI** opens.
- Top-level structure:
  - Filter row: `All | Common Hunts | Deeds`
  - Later region tabs can be added as `Greatwood | Hollowroot | …`.
- Each entry card shows:
  - **Name** (e.g. “Cull the Greybacks”)
  - **Type icon** (beast / corruption / outlaw / escort / special)
  - **Level band** (e.g. 3–6)
  - **Solo / group suggestion**
  - **Key reward tags** (Rep, Ingredients, Trophy, Recipe, etc.)

## 1.3 Access & Limits

- Unlocked by Greatwood Lodge intro chain (Chapter 1 main story).
- Player limits:
  - Up to **3 Common Hunts** active at once.
  - Up to **1 active Deed** per region (here: 1 Greatwood Deed at a time).
- Refresh logic (high level, detail in Tech section):
  - Common Hunts: soft rotation daily/weekly per player.
  - Deeds: static unlocks gated by story and reputation.

## 5.1 Data Model Sketch

**Common Hunts**

- `id` – string, e.g. `"CH-GW-001"`.
- `name` – localized display name.
- `type` – enum (`cull`, `track_kill`, `escort`, `investigate`, `corruption_probe`, etc.).
- `level_min`, `level_max`.
- `target_family` – references enemy taxonomy.
- `region_tags[]` – e.g. `["greatwood", "low_eaves"]`.
- `objectives[]` – simple objective definitions (kill, interact, defend).
- `reward_bundles[]` – loot/rep profiles.
- `rep_tags[]` – which Lodge tracks get credit.

**Deeds**

- `id`, `name`.
- `level_band`.
- `steps[]` – each step is:
  - `type` (travel, investigate, kill, defend, dialogue).
  - `requirements`.
  - `POI markers`.
- `unique_rewards[]` – trophy IDs, recipe unlocks, etc.
- `unlock_conditions` – story/rep gates.

## 5.2 Board Refresh Logic (Summary)

  - Unlocked by:
    - Main story progress
    - Reputation thresholds
    - Completion of prerequisite Hunts.

## 5.3 Group Handling

- Hunt credit shared for:
  - Kills
  - Objective interactions
- Deeds:
  - Step progress shared for all party members who:
    - Have the Deed active
    - Are in reasonable proximity.
- UI:
  - Board marks Hunts and Deeds already owned by party members.

## 5.4 Failure & Abandonment

- Common Hunts:
  - Can be:
    - Abandoned with no penalty (other than lost time).
    - Soft-failed on timer; available again later.
- Deeds:
  - Major failures may:
    - Lock specific branches.
    - Unlock alternate “aftermath” dialogues or smaller follow-up Hunts.
  - The board can show crossed-out or red-tinted entries if a Deed ends badly.

# 6. Next Extensions

Once this file is locked:

1. **Write quest-log copy** for:
   - 1–2 sentences per Common Hunt (player-facing).
   - 3–5 sentence blurbs per Deed step.
2. **Tag enemies and POIs** in encounter design:
   - Ensure every Hunt and Deed has a unique visual/mechanical hook.
3. **Add 3–5 more Hunts** at higher tiers (18–25) for late-Greatwood.
4. **Define first Hollowroot-region Hunts** in file 63+ using this as the template.
