# 52 – Greatwood Early Cooking Recipe Grid (Levels 1–10)

## Purpose

Define a clear, structured set of early-game Cooking recipes for Greatwood (levels 1–10) using the shared ingredient taxonomy. This grid is meant to:

- Teach the player basic “cooking language” without a tutorial wall
- Make early Cooking feel useful (stamina, regen, resistances)
- Establish Lodge / Greatwood food identity
- Slot cleanly into future expansions (10–20, region 2, alchemy, etc.)

This is a **design reference**, not implementation code.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Simple patterns first**  
   - Meat + herb  
   - Meat + mushroom  
   - Veg + herb  
   - “Snack” vs “Meal”

2. **Low friction**  
   - Use mostly Common & Uncommon ingredients from 51_Ingredient_Taxonomy  
   - Recipes should be realistically craftable by a player just running around Greatwood

3. **Readable buffs**  
   - No weird edge-case effects at this tier  
   - Direct buffs like: stamina regen, simple resistances, minor max HP

4. **Identity over min-maxing**  
   - Foods should sound like Lodge hunter staples and forest meals  
   - Naming + flavor text matters

---

## Recipe Structure

Each recipe entry should follow this format:

- **ID:** `recipe_...` (e.g. `recipe_simple_venison_stew`)
- **Display Name:** “Simple Venison Stew”
- **Tier:** 1–5 (rough internal tier, not player-facing level)
- **Required Cooking Skill:** 1–10
- **Ingredients:** list of ingredient IDs from taxonomy
- **Effect:** short mechanical summary
- **Duration:** approximate in-game minutes
- **Source:** how the player learns it (default, Lodge vendor, quest, drop)
- **Flavor Text:** 1–2 lines

Example:

- ID: `recipe_simple_venison_stew`  
  - Display Name: Simple Venison Stew  
  - Tier: 1  
  - Required Cooking Skill: 1  
  - Ingredients:
    - `deer_meat_raw` x1
    - `bitterpine_needle` x1
    - `lodge_salt_mix` x1  
  - Effect: +5% stamina regen, +2% max HP for 20 min  
  - Duration: 20 minutes  
  - Source: Base Lodge Cooking trainer  
  - Flavor: “Every hunter starts here. Hot, salty, and just enough pine to cut the gaminess.”

## Sources & Unlock Flow

- **Default / Trainer:** 1–2 core recipes (skewers, simple stew)
- **Lodge Vendor:** a couple of early and mid-tier recipes
- **Quests:** special dishes tied to Lodge and Greatwood story beats
- **World Drops:** notes found in camps, on hunters, in dungeons (Hollowroot Warren, etc.)

The idea: by Cooking 10, a player who explores has a solid library that feels like **Greatwood hunter food**, not generic MMO mush.

## Next Actions

- Expand this draft into a full table with exact numbers once combat balance is clearer.
- Sync mandatory ingredients with the final taxonomy from 51.
- Hook specific recipes into quest rewards and vendor inventories.
