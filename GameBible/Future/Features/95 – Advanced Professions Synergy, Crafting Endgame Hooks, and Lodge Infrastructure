# 95 – Advanced Professions Synergy, Crafting Endgame Hooks, and Lodge Infrastructure

## Purpose

Define a **future-facing framework** for:

- How professions interlock at higher depth (Cook, Forester, Woodworker, Alchemy, future crafts – 52–59, 78, 85)
- How crafted goods support:
  - Hunts & Deeds (61, 66, 79)
  - Camps, outposts, and settlements (77, 93)
  - Corruption and late-game challenges (91)
- How Lodge infrastructure can **upgrade over time** through profession output

Goal: make professions feel like a **real backbone of Lodge power**, not just side systems, and set hooks for long-term progression beyond Greatwood 1–20.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Professions feed the Lodge, not just the player**
   - Crafted items can:
     - Improve Lodge infrastructure.
     - Support outposts and settlements.
     - Influence Ember Pot and festivals (85, 94).

2. **Interlocking recipes**
   - Higher-tier recipes require:
     - Outputs from multiple professions.
   - Example:
     - Woodworker frame + Forester resin + Alchemy vial + Cook’s infusion.

3. **Progression in breadth and depth**
   - Depth:
     - More complex recipes within a profession.
   - Breadth:
     - Cross-profession projects (camp upgrades, Lodge repairs, ritual sites).

4. **No infinite treadmill**
   - Endgame hooks aim at:
     - Improving the world and its infrastructure.
     - Creating new paths, hunts, or buffs.
   - Not just making ever-bigger stat sticks.
