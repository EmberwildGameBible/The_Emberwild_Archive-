# 83 – Lodge Hierarchy, Leadership, and Internal Politics (Greatwood Era)

## Purpose

Define the **internal structure of the Lodge**:

- Leadership roles and council structure
- Major factions and “wings” within the Lodge
- How politics and disagreements show up in:
  - Quests & Deeds
  - Reputation tracks (59)
  - Social layer & festivals (64)
  - Long-term story arcs

Goal: make the Lodge feel like a **real, fractious institution**, not just a vendor hub.

---

## Core Concept

The Lodge is:

- An independent **hunter’s institution** anchored in Greatwood.
- Run by:
  - A small leadership council.
  - Voices from professions and field veterans.
- Under constant internal tension between:
  - Tradition vs adaptation.
  - Caution vs aggression.
  - Forest-first vs people-first thinking.

The player doesn’t join a “faction” MMO-style, but feels these tensions through dialogue and quest framing.

## Lodge High-Level Structure

### The Council (Top Layer)

A small group of senior figures:

1. **The Warden** – overall head of the Lodge.
2. **The Huntmaster** – oversees hunts, Deeds, and field operations.
3. **The Keeper of the Ember** – oversees Ember Pot, food, morale, domestic side.
4. **The Quartermaster** – handles supplies, trade, gear, and the economy.

Each has:

- Personality
- Opinions on how the Lodge should operate
- Influence over certain systems (Hunts, food, gear, etc.)

### The Wings (Operational Layer)

- **Forester’s Circle** (59)
- **Ember Kitchen** (59, 52, 53, 56)
- **Carpenter’s Hall** (59, 54)
- (Future) Alchemy/Apothecary wing (58 stub)

These wings are semi-autonomous clusters under the Council’s umbrella.

## Faction-Like Tensions (Soft, Narrative Only)

Rather than hard factions, we have **tension vectors**:

1. **“Open the Forest” vs “Guard the Forest”**
   - Some believe:
     - The Lodge should expand, hunt harder, and take more risks.
   - Others believe:
     - The Lodge’s duty is stewardship and restraint.

2. **“Old Ways” vs “New Methods”**
   - Old guard:
     - Favors traditional tracking, minimal alchemy, cautious expansion.
   - Innovators:
     - Foresters experimenting with Hollowroot, Alchemists, more complex traps (58, 79).

3. **“Hunt First” vs “Home First”**
   - Hunt-focused cohort:
     - Cares most about glory, big Deeds, and world bosses.
   - Home-focused cohort:
     - Cares about keeping the Ember Pot full, Lodge safe, and families fed.

These tensions show up in:

- Dialogue and quest framing.
- Slightly different rewards or narrative style, not min-max differences.

## How the Player Feels Lodge Politics

### Dialogue & Quests

- Some quests are framed as:
  - Experiments encouraged by one leader, questioned by another.
- Example:
  - New Hollowroot alchemy approach:
    - Keeper of the Ember is wary.
    - An alchemist or Huntmaster pushes for it as necessary.

### Reputation & Access

- Lodge rep (59) as **overall trust metric**:
  - High rep:
    - Council is more honest with you.
    - Confides in you about internal disagreements.
- Profession wings:
  - May express preference:
    - “Huntmaster thinks we should push further into the burn-scars. I’m not so sure.”

### Branching Emphasis (Soft)

- In some Deeds:
  - Player may choose:
    - More cautious approach (save people, less loot but more goodwill).
    - More aggressive approach (kill the beast, higher risk, different rewards).

This doesn’t lock future content, but leaves **marks in dialogue**.

---

## Everyday Politics & Idle Life (64)

- Ambient conversations among NPCs:
  - Disagreements about:
    - How many resources to send to certain fronts.
    - Whether Greatwood is “worse than it used to be.”
- Festivals:
  - Ember Night Feast:
    - Some grumble: “We’re feasting while the forest rots.”
  - Remembrance:
    - Others grumble: “We remember, but we don’t change.”

---

## External Powers (Future Hooks)

Even if not fully present in 1–20, the Lodge:

- May have:
  - Old ties to distant cities or other Lodges.
  - Tense relationships with nearby settlements, nobility, or rival hunting groups.
- Hinted through:
  - Letters on tables.
  - Conversations about “supplies drying up” or “a council far away making strange demands.”

These become seeds for future expansions beyond Greatwood.

---

## Gameplay Impact (1–20)

For Greatwood 1–20, politics mostly affects:

- **Flavor**:
  - How quests are pitched.
  - How NPCs react to your choices.
- **Access**:
  - Certain Deeds require:
    - Council approval after a prior storyline.
- **Minor reward variations**:
  - Example:
    - Warden route: slightly safer quest path, more Lodge rep.
    - Huntmaster route: slightly tougher version, better loot, same rep.

There are no rigid “Lodge faction” talent trees or locked-off core content.

---

## Integration With Other Systems

- **Reputation tracks (59):**
  - Council might react differently at certain rep thresholds.
- **Deeds (61, 66):**
  - Big Hunts often have a political angle:
    - “We can’t ignore this beast any longer” vs “This will cost too many lives.”
- **Festivals & social (64):**
  - Council presence and speeches at events reinforce identity.
- **Game Bible / Codex (69):**
  - Entries about:
    - Past Wardens.
    - Old schisms or crises.
    - How Lodge nearly broke once before.

---

## Next Actions

- Lock in **names, genders, and personalities** for:
  - Warden
  - Huntmaster
  - Keeper of the Ember
  - Quartermaster
- Write:
  - 2–3 example council scenes:
    - Brief arguments or discussions around a Deed or crisis.
- Map:
  - Which main quests and Deeds intersect with Lodge politics.
  - Where player choices can produce different flavor outcomes.
