# B160 – Greatwood Major Hunts – Overview & Progression Map

## 0. Purpose

This file is the **big-picture map** of all major Hunts in Greatwood 1–20 and how they fit together:

- Narrative roles and themes
- Recommended progression and gating
- How each Hunt ties into:
  - Ingredients & specialties (51, 55)
  - Professions & tools (54)
  - Recipes & brews (52, 53, 58)
  - Lodge projects & rituals (57)
  - Loot system (B151)

When you are thinking, “Which Hunts are actually in Greatwood and why do they matter?”, this is where you start.

It is not a replacement for the individual integration files:

- B153 – Black-Sap Devourer – Full Hunt Integration  
- B154 – Hollowroot Matron – Full Hunt Integration  
- B155 – Elder Hollow Stag – Full Hunt Integration  
- B156 – Ward-Bear – Full Hunt Integration  
- B157 – Greatwood Howler – Full Hunt Integration  
- B158 – Ragged King – Full Hunt Integration  
- B159 – Shadow Under the Wardstone – Full Hunt Integration  

Instead, B160 tells you how those seven fit together into **one coherent Greatwood 1–20 arc**.

## 1. The Greatwood Major Hunt Roster

These are the seven “big, named” Hunts for Greatwood 1–20:

1. **Elder Hollow Stag** (B155) – Forest balance, vitality, Heartwood  
2. **Ward-Bear** (B156) – Wardstone guardian, physical defense, knockback  
3. **Greatwood Howler** (B157) – Alpha wolf, pack pressure, warbrew  
4. **Hollowroot Matron** (B154) – Hollowroot infestation, corruption pockets  
5. **Black-Sap Devourer** (B153) – Black Sap consumption, wardline rot  
6. **Ragged King** (B158) – Ash, old hunts, bone and ember  
7. **Shadow Under the Wardstone** (B159) – Wardstone Hill shadow/ward failure

They are not linear in a strict “1–7” order, but they do have **recommended bands** and **narrative weight**, which this doc lays out.

---

## 2. Recommended Progression & Level Bands

This is a **design recommendation**, not a hard rule. It ensures:

- The player sees the forest, its guardians, its predators, its corruption, and its consequences in a logical arc.
- Power spikes and reward spikes feel earned.

### 2.1 Level Bands

Approximate recommended ranges:

- **Mid Greatwood (12–18)**:
  - Elder Hollow Stag
  - Greatwood Howler

- **Mid–Late Greatwood (14–20)**:
  - Ward-Bear
  - Hollowroot Matron

- **Late Greatwood (16–20)**:
  - Black-Sap Devourer
  - Ragged King
  - Shadow Under the Wardstone

### 2.2 Suggested Order (Soft Path)

A sensible narrative/combat path might look like:

1. **Elder Hollow Stag** – learn forest balance, Heartwood, and the idea that “the forest has a will”.
2. **Greatwood Howler** – experience predator pressure, pack mechanics, and warbrew fantasy.
3. **Ward-Bear** – step into ward/defense identity and knockback-heavy combat.
4. **Hollowroot Matron** – dive into Hollowroot pockets and understand corruption as a systemic thing.
5. **Black-Sap Devourer** – escalate corruption into Black Sap and heavy wardline strain.
6. **Ragged King** – confront the accumulated consequences of old hunts, bones, and ash.
7. **Shadow Under the Wardstone** – clean out the core of Wardstone Hill; resolve late-Greatwood ward storyline.

Nothing stops you from rearranging these, but if nothing else is specified:

- Stag + Howler are “early majors”.
- Ward-Bear + Matron are “middle majors”.
- Devourer + Ragged King + Shadow are “late majors”.

## 3. Quick Reference – Hunts at a Glance

Short table for design reading:

| Hunt                         | Band    | Theme                              | Core Specialties / Reagents (55/51)                            | Primary System Hooks                                      |

Use this when you need to decide:

- “Which Hunt should own this new ingredient or project?”
- “Which fight theme matches this new mechanic?”

## 4. Relation to Core System Files

These seven Hunts sit on top of the **system spine** defined in:

- **51 – Greatwood Ingredient Taxonomy**
- **52 – Early Cooking Recipe Grid**
- **53 – Advanced Cooking & Signature Lodge Dishes**
- **54 – Profession Tools & Gear Sets**
- **55 – Specialty Ingredients from Hunts, Bosses, and Events**
- **57 – Profession Combo Recipes & Lodge Projects**
- **58 – Alchemy Stub: Hunter Tonics, Balms, and Brews**
- **B151 – Greatwood Loot & Drop System (1–20)**

Each Hunt is essentially:

- A **bundle** of:

  - Creature/encounter design,
  - A subset of 51 (base ingredients),
  - A subset of 55 (specialties),
  - Pointers into 52/53/58 (food/brews),
  - Entrypoints into 57 (projects, trophies, rituals),
  - And entries in B151 (actual loot tables).

### 4.1 Which Hunts Own What Themes

High-level ownership:

- **Forest / Heartwood / balance:**
  - Elder Hollow Stag (B155)
- **Predators / war / pack:**
  - Greatwood Howler (B157)
- **Ward guardianship / physical defense:**
  - Ward-Bear (B156)
- **Plant corruption / Hollowroot:**
  - Hollowroot Matron (B154)
- **Black Sap / corrupt sap:**
  - Black-Sap Devourer (B153)
- **Ash / old hunts / bones:**
  - Ragged King (B158)
- **Wardstone failure / shadow:**
  - Shadow Under Wardstone (B159)

When adding new content, you can ask:

> “Which Hunt’s theme is this closest to?”  
> Then attach the new ingredient/project to that Hunt’s ecosystem.

## 5. Progression Web – How Hunts Unlock Each Other

This section is a **design sketch** of how Hunts could unlock or reference each other. You don’t have to implement every gate exactly, but it’s useful as a mental model.

### 5.1 Early Majors Feed the Mid

- **Elder Hollow Stag** unlocks or nudges:
  - Ward NPC dialogue about balance and Heartwood.
  - Early leads that later point toward Ward-Bear and Matron.

- **Greatwood Howler** unlocks or nudges:
  - Warbrew line in 58.
  - Hunter conversations that reference Ward-Bear and Ragged King:
    - (“There are worse things than wolves when the bones start walking.”)

### 5.2 Mid Majors Feed Corruption & Wardlines

- **Ward-Bear**:
  - Bridges:

    - Wardstone Hill story,
    - Defensive food/brews,
    - Guardian totem projects in 57.

  - Flags:

    - “The wards are under pressure from Hollowroot and something under the Hill.”

- **Hollowroot Matron**:
  - Solidifies Hollowroot as:

    - A systemic threat (pockets and Matron heart),
    - A source of anti-corruption reagents (cores, heart fiber).

  - Points toward:

    - Black-Sap Devourer (sap thickening in certain Hollowroot-heavy areas),
    - Ragged King (bones and sludge mixing in barrow regions).

### 5.3 Late Majors Close Out the Region

- **Black-Sap Devourer**:
  - Asserts:

    - Black Sap as the extreme corruption end of tree/sap systems.

  - Naturally connects back to:

    - Ward-Bear (wardlines under strain),
    - Hollowroot Matron (Hollowroot and Sap colliding),
    - Shadow Under Wardstone (wards failing due to internal corruption).

- **Ragged King**:
  - Ties:

    - All prior Hunts’ bone and ash leftover together.

  - Logically feels like:

    - A “capstone consequence” of too many Hunts and old wars.

- **Shadow Under the Wardstone**:
  - Ties:

    - Ward-Bear’s ward focus,
    - Matron/Devourer’s corruption headaches,
    - Ragged King’s “forest memory” theme.

  - Leaves the region in:

    - A stabilized state (for now) after you clear it.

## 7. Player Experience Arc

This is the “emotional curve” if a player does most or all Hunts in a sensible order.

1. **Curiosity and respect** – Elder Hollow Stag  
   Player learns the forest is not just a resource; it has “elders” and balance.

2. **Paranoia and pack fear** – Greatwood Howler  
   Player experiences being hunted, not just hunting.

3. **Stability and guardianship** – Ward-Bear  
   Player sees that some big things are actually protecting them and the wards.

4. **Creeping corruption** – Hollowroot Matron  
   Player confronts systemic plant corruption forming pockets underground.

5. **Active devouring corruption** – Black-Sap Devourer  
   Player faces corruption that is mobile, hungry, and hostile to wards.

6. **Consequences and memory** – Ragged King  
   Player faces the echo of countless kills and fires; the forest “remembers”.

7. **Resolution and cleansing** – Shadow Under the Wardstone  
   Player finally deals with the rot under Wardstone Hill and sets the stage for what comes after Greatwood.

Use this when writing:

- Quest text,
- NPC reactions,
- Region-level changes after each Hunt.

---

## 8. Implementation Notes – Data & Structure

When you later translate this into actual data/code:

- Each Hunt should have:

  1. A **Hunt definition**:
     - ID, name, recommended level, theme tags.
  2. An **encounter definition**:
     - Phases, abilities, arena hooks (from B153–B159).
  3. A set of **loot table entries** in B151:
     - Creature IDs, guaranteed/core/bonus/world drops.
  4. A mapping to:
     - Ingredients in 51,
     - Specialties in 55,
     - Recipes in 52/53,
     - Brews in 58,
     - Projects/rituals in 57.

- B152 (Greatwood 1–20 Systems Index) + B160 (this file) act together as:

  - The “map” for:
    - Systems (B152),
    - Hunts (B160).

If you ever feel like:

> “I want to add one new Hunt, or merge two, or cut one,”

you can:

- Use this file (B160) to see where it sits in:

  - The progression,
  - The themes,
  - The system loops.

Then:

- Update B151, 51, 55, 52, 53, 57, 58, and the individual B15x integration doc for that Hunt accordingly.
