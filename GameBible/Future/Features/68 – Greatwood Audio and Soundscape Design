# 68 – Greatwood Audio & Soundscape: Forest, Lodge, and Combat Cues

## Purpose

Define the **audio identity** of Greatwood and the Lodge:

- Ambient forest soundscape
- Lodge interior and social audio
- Combat & tracking cues specifically tuned to Emberwild’s slower, grounded pace

This is a **sound design bible stub** for Greatwood 1–20, not final implementation.

## Audio Pillars

1. **Living Forest**  
   The forest is never completely silent. Layers of subtle life.

2. **Safe vs Unsafe**  
   Audio shifts as you move from Lodge → normal forest → corruption zones → dungeons.

3. **Information Without Overwhelm**  
   Sounds should carry **information** (direction, threat, rarity) without constant noise.

4. **Lodge as Home**  
   The Lodge should have a warm, layered sound bed that feels like “returning to base.”

## Ambient Layers – Greatwood

### Base Layer (Always On)

- Wind through trees:
  - Different intensities based on region (clifftops vs low forest).
- Distant bird calls:
  - Vary by time of day.
- Rustling underbrush:
  - Occasional scurrying, leaves shifting.

Goal: comfortable and textured, not overly dramatic.

### Regional Variations

- **Lower Hunting Grounds:**
  - Clear birdlife
  - Occasional deer/snort sounds
- **Rivers/Wetlands:**
  - Water movement, frogs, insects
- **Hollowroot Edge:**
  - Duller sound bed, “muted” normal life
  - Occasional unnatural sounds (distant echoes, odd hums)
- **Burn-Scars:**
  - Wind whistling through dead branches
  - Creaking, ash shifting, fewer bird calls

### Time-of-Day Variations

- **Dawn:**
  - Bird chorus, light breeze
- **Day:**
  - Full ambient mix, stable
- **Dusk:**
  - Bird calls shift, insects rise
- **Night:**
  - Reduced high-end noise
  - Focus on crickets, owls, distant predator calls

---

## Lodge Soundscape

### Core Bed

- Murmur of voices (layers of group talk, low volume)
- Occasional laughter, clinking of cups
- Ember Pot bubbling softly
- Crackling hearth fires

### Contextual Layers

- **Daytime:**
  - More workshop sounds:
    - Hammers, saws, scraping, sharpening.
- **Evening:**
  - Louder conversations
  - Songs, light music, more laughter
- **Late Night:**
  - Mostly quiet with a few low conversations
  - Fire pops, creaks of the building

### Spatialization

- Profession wings:
  - Forester wing: map rustling, tool clinks, quiet discussions.
  - Ember Kitchen: chopping, sizzling, cooking sounds.
  - Carpenter’s Hall: hammering, sawing, wood creaks.

Player moving through Lodge should hear distinct microzones.

---

## Combat & Threat Cues

### Near Threat (Non-Combat Yet)

- Subtle “edge” sounds:
  - Low growls just at hearing edge
  - Branch snapping slightly too close
- Rare / high-threat creatures:
  - Unique call or roar that players learn to recognize over time.

### Combat Start

- Soft stinger or emphasized “focus” moment:
  - Low-key compared to typical MMO, consistent with grounded tone.
- Priority:
  - Player weapon sounds
  - Enemy attacks and tells
  - Minimal repetitive generic “combat music”

### Enemy Audio Identity

Each enemy family should have a recognizable “language”:

- Wolves:
  - Bark/growl/huff patterns for:
    - Aggro
    - Flank calls
    - Retreat
- Boars:
  - Snorts and squeals for:
    - Warning
    - Charge telegraph
- Corrupted creatures:
  - Layered natural + unnatural sounds (reverse/reverb/low drones).

World bosses (66) get especially strong audio signatures.

---

## Tracking & Fieldcraft Hooks (67)

Audio should support tracking:

- Distant call that hints direction for hunts or Deeds.
- “Quiet moments” where ambient bed dips slightly when hidden major threats are near, so subtle cues stand out.
- Tonics (58) and perception buffs:
  - Could alter the mix:
    - Certain clues become louder or clearer
    - Ambient noise subtly dampened

---

## Hollowroot Warren Audio (65)

Dungeon-specific soundscape:

- Root creaks, low groans
- Dripping moisture
- Faint fungal pulses or spore releases (soft “whoomph” / hiss)
- Distant echoing snarls from beasts deeper inside

Boss arenas:

- Distinct, more oppressive audio bed:
  - Low-frequency pulses for root-heart
  - Echo-like reverb for cavernous chambers

---

## UI / System Sounds

### Minimalist UI Approach

- Keep **UI beeps/clicks** to a minimum.
- Use:
  - Soft wood/cloth sounds for menus
  - Pages turning / leather flap for Game Bible / codex interfaces
- Quest & Hunt notifications:
  - Small, warm chime rather than harsh alert.

### Crafting & Profession SFX

- **Cooking:**
  - Subtle simmer/sizzle, knife chops, ladle clinks.
- **Woodworking:**
  - Chisel taps, sanding, wood flex.
- **Forester:**
  - Axe hits, branches snapping, rope sounds.

Tie these tightly to profession loops so audio reinforces identity.

---

## Music Direction (Stub)

- **Exploration:**
  - Sparse, moody, textural. Fewer melodies, more evolving pads/texture.
- **Lodge:**
  - Warmer instrumentation (strings, woodwinds, simple guitar/mandolin vibes).
- **Combat:**
  - Low to mid-intensity for most fights, more percussive for bosses.
- **Special Events:**
  - Stronger, memorable themes for:
    - Ember Night Feast
    - Great hunts
    - World boss encounters

Music should support pacing: quiet when tracking, richer when feasting, tense when hunted.

## Next Actions

- Create a **sound palette** doc:
  - List of instruments, textures, and environmental sounds for Greatwood.
- Produce:
  - 1–2 prototype exploration loops
  - 1 Lodge interior loop
  - 1 boss encounter sketch
- Define audio tags/hooks for:
  - Regions (63)
  - Events (62)
  - Dungeon (65)
  - Bosses (66)
  - Lodge festivals and social scenes (64)
