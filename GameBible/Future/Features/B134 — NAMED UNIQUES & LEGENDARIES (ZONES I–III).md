# B134 — NAMED UNIQUES & LEGENDARIES (ZONES I–III)
1. Rarity & Role of Uniques

Within 1–60 progression, these items are:

Rarity:

Usually LEGENDARY for zone-specific chase pieces.

Sometimes ULTRA for true world jackpots tied to crafting cores.

Power Level:

Roughly 15–30% stronger than a typical Rare of the same level/slot.

Plus unique effects (procs, passives, or build-enabling bonuses).

Drop Rules:

Always tied to specific bosses / rare mobs / world-drop pools.

Drop chances are low (0.1–1.0% range depending on encounter frequency).

2. Greatwood Uniques (Lv 10–19)

Greatwood is your first “real” zone. These items are meant to feel almost too good for the band without breaking the game.

2.1 Veilpiercer, Dagger of the Widow

Slot: Main-Hand Dagger

Level: 19

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: AGI melee (rogue/pirate/hunter off-spec)

Source:

Primary: Thornspine Widow (very low drop chance)

Secondary: Greatwood world-drop table (extremely low)

Stats:

+24 Agility

+18 Stamina

+40 Attack Power

+2% Crit Chance

+1% Hit Chance

On-Hit: Apply a minor stacking poison effect:

Up to 3 stacks

Each stack deals small Nature damage over 8 sec

Stacks refresh rather than extend forever

Identity:

This is the first “real” dagger where players feel like they’re playing a poison build, without it being absurd. It’s clearly better than Sapdrifter’s Razorfang but still outclassed by later 30–40 weapons.

2.2 Wisp-Touched Cloak

Slot: Back

Level: 18

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: All (light defensive/utility piece)

Source:

Wisp-Touched Fawn (rare spawn). ~10–15% chance on kill.

Stats:

+10 to Primary Stat (STR/AGI/INT depending on class)

+14 Stamina

+8 Spirit

+8 Armor

+1% Dodge (melee/ranged classes) OR +1% Spell Avoid (casters)*

*Implementation detail: you can either have 1 generic “Avoidance” stat, or convert based on class.

Passive:

Glimmerstep: While outdoors in Greatwood, your out-of-combat movespeed is increased by 4%, and your first hit taken after leaving stealth/invisibility deals 5% less damage.

Identity:

A cloak that feels magical and rare, but not mandatory. Awesome if you get it, not game-breaking if you don’t.

2.3 Heartroot Crown

Slot: Head (Leather or Cloth variant; you can define both later if you want)

Level: 19

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Primarily casters/hybrids (Heartroot → magic/nature).

Source:

Greatwood Sentinel (zone elite). Very low drop chance (0.5–1.0%).

Stats (Caster variant):

+18 Intellect

+12 Spirit

+12 Stamina

+18 Spell Power

+1% Spell Crit Chance

Passive:

Heart of the Grove: Healing and nature spells on friendly targets have a very small chance to grant:

+10% Spell Power for 8 seconds (self only).

Internal cooldown (e.g. 30 sec) to prevent spam abuse.

Identity:

Soft intro to “proc helm” design. Strong but not insane; the buff is short and occasional.

2.4 Greatwood Heartshield

Slot: Off-Hand Shield

Level: 19

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Tanks / frontliners

Source:

Rare drop from Greatwood Sentinel OR a small chance from Mossfur Gnarlbear as an alternate path.

Stats:

+22 Stamina

+110 Armor

+4% Block Chance

+24 Block Value

Passive:

Rooted Stand: After blocking an attack, gain +3% damage reduction for 6 seconds (stacks up to 2 times).

Identity:

First “real” tank shield that feels like a big deal. Solid jump above Heartroot Bastion Shield.

2.5 Greatwood’s Echo (World-Only Trinket)

Slot: Trinket

Level: 19

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Any DPS

Source:

Greatwood world-drop table only, any mob Lv 15–19. Extremely low chance (jackpot).

+10 Stamina

+1% Crit Chance

Use Effect (2 min CD):

Echo of the Wild: For 15 seconds, your critical strikes deal an additional 8% damage.

Identity:

A high-variance burst trinket that gives players their first taste of “proper cooldown windows” without overdoing it.

3. Ashen Ridge Uniques (Lv 20–29)

Ashen Ridge is where builds start really diverging. These items push into fire/forging themes and feel clearly above the Rare sets.

3.1 Cinderkiss Blade

Slot: Main-Hand Sword (or Dagger, your choice; stats tuned as 1H melee weapon)

Level: 26

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: STR or AGI melee DPS

Source:

Primary: Magma Wretch (very low chance, but they’re plentiful).

Secondary: Ashen Ridge world-drop table.

Stats:

+24 main stat (STR or AGI depending on itemization)

+20 Stamina

+46 Attack Power

+2% Crit Chance

+1% Hit Chance

On-Hit:

10% chance to apply Cinderkiss:

Small Fire DoT over 6 sec

Stacks up to 2 times, independent of your usual bleeds/poisons

Identity:

Bread-and-butter “sword with a fire DoT” that’s meaningfully stronger than Magmastring Recurve / Mossfur weapons at the same level.

3.2 Embersteel Warplate

Slot: Chest (Heavy)

Level: 28

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Frontline STR tanks/bruisers

Source:

Crafted with Embersteel Plate + Emberforge Heart + high-tier forging recipe.

Materials come from Basalt Juggernaut and Furnacebound Golem.

Stats:

Emberguard: When you block or parry, you have a small chance to gain +5% damage reduction for 8 sec.

Internal cooldown e.g. 20 sec.

Identity:

End-of-band tank chest that outclasses Basalt Vanguard Flameguard Chest but doesn’t trivialize later zones.

3.3 Flamecut Edge

Slot: Main-Hand Sword

Level: 28

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Melee DPS (STR)

Source:

Ashen Ridge world-drop (20–29), extremely rare.

Higher effective rate from elite mobs / mini-bosses.

Stats:

+28 Strength

+22 Stamina

+54 Attack Power

+2% Crit Chance

On-Hit:

Flamecut: Your critical strikes cause an additional burst of fire damage (non-DoT), scaled modestly with level/AP.

Identity:

“Crit sword” with a fire twist; synergizes with high-crit builds without being mandatory.

3.4 Emberwake Conduit

Slot: Two-Hand Staff

Ashen Ridge world-drop staff, with slightly higher odds from Furnacebound Golem.

Stats:

+32 Intellect

+2% Spell Crit Chance

+8 Mana per 5 sec

Passive:

Burning Channel: Spells that critically hit have a small chance to grant:

+10% Spell Power for 10 sec

Internal CD ~30 sec

Identity:

Caster equivalent of a “best in band” wand/staff. Plays nicely into crit windows and mana sustain.

3.5 Emberwrought Loop

Source:

Ashen Ridge world-drop table (20–29).

Stats:

+12 Primary Stat

+10 Stamina

+1% Crit Chance

+1% Fire Resistance

Identity:

Subtle but great ring. Not insane, but slightly above typical Rare rings and very flexible.

4. Frostmarch Uniques (Lv 30–39)

Frostmarch is colder, meaner, and more attrition-based; these items lean into frost, rune, and thunder identity.

4.1 Glaciathral Greatsword

Slot: Two-Hand Sword / Axe

Level: 38

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: STR heavy DPS

Source:

Rare drop from Winterborn Thrall and/or Frostvein Colossus.

Stats:

+36 Strength

+30 Stamina

+92 Attack Power

+2% Crit Chance

Passive:

Glacial Rupture:

Your melee critical strikes have a small chance to freeze the target for a very short time (e.g. 1.5 sec) or heavily slow them if they’re elite/boss.

Internal cooldown ~20–30 sec.

Identity:

This is the big Frostmarch STR weapon. Strong, but limited by ICD and level band.

4.2 Thunderhide Warplate

Slot: Chest (Heavy)

Level: 39

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Tanks

Source:

Drop from Stormhide Mammoth (zone boss). Low chance (maybe 5–10% on kill).

Stats:

+26 Strength

+40 Stamina

+140 Armor

+3% Block Chance

+1% Dodge

Passive:

Thunderhide Resilience:

When you drop below 35% Health, gain:

+8% damage reduction and +8% movement speed for 8 sec.

Can occur only once every 90 sec.

Identity:

Feels like the natural “prize” for killing Stormhide Mammoth and a noticeable tank survivability spine for the tail end of this band.

4.3 Stormhide Warhorn

Slot: Trinket

Level: 39

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: Tanks / melee supports

Source:

Also Stormhide Mammoth, lower drop rate than the Warplate.

Stats:

+18 Stamina

+1% Block Chance

Use Effect (3 min CD):

Call of the Stormhide:

For 15 sec:

You and nearby allies gain +3% Haste and +3% damage.

Identity:

First big group buff item. Strong but not insane; cooldown keeps it special.

4.4 Eternal Aurora Staff

Slot: Two-Hand Staff

Level: 38

Rarity: Legendary (named unique)

Intended Users: Pure casters

Source:

Upgraded or rare version of the staff dropped by Frostvein Colossus.

You can treat the old one as Rare and this as a much rarer Legendary variant, or just replace the Rare with this if you prefer.

Stats:

+36 Intellect

+28 Spirit

+24 Stamina

+80 Spell Power

+3% Spell Crit Chance

+10 Mana per 5 sec

Passive:

Periodically gain a short buff granting +10% Spell Power for 8 sec.

This buff has a long-ish internal CD (e.g. 45 sec).

Identity:

End-of-band caster staff that is clearly better than Runebound / Coresong but doesn’t break late game.

4.5 Boreal Trailcloak

Slot: Back

Level: 37

Rarity: Legendary

Intended Users: AGI-oriented classes that value survivability and movement

Source:

Frostmarch world-drop table (30–39), slightly higher weight on Frostmaw Lynx / Brittleclaw Raptor.

Stats:

+18 Agility

+16 Stamina

+1% Dodge

+1% Crit Chance

+Frost Resistance (small amount)

Passive:

Hunter’s Path:

Outdoors in Frostmarch, your combat movement speed is increased by 3%, and the first slowing effect applied to you every 30 sec is reduced in potency.

Identity:

Signature “hunter cloak” for the zone, fits the Glacierstalker fantasy.
