# 64 – Lodge Social Layer: Festivals, Games, and Idle Life

## Purpose

Design the **social layer** of the Lodge:

- Festivals and periodic events
- Small games and activities
- “Idle life” (NPC behaviors, routines, ambient scenes)

Goal: make the Lodge feel like a **living home base**, not just a quest menu.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Comfort & Routine**  
   Players should feel a sense of “coming home” to the Lodge.

2. **Light Interactivity**  
   Add small games and interactions that don’t require huge systems but give texture.

3. **Time & State Awareness**  
   Lodge presence changes based on:
   - Time of day
   - Recent major events (wildfire, big hunts)
   - Player progress in key questlines (56, 60)

4. **Hooks into Systems**  
   Use festivals and social events to:
   - Boost or showcase Cooking
   - Support Hunts and Deeds
   - Advance profession reputation (59)

---

## Daily / Routine Lodge Life

### NPC Routines

- **Cooks**:
  - Stirring the Ember Pot
  - Carrying ingredients and tasting dishes
- **Hunters**:
  - Cleaning weapons
  - Telling stories around smaller fires
- **Foresters**:
  - Studying maps, sharpening tools, preparing survey runs
- **Woodworkers**:
  - Working at benches, repairing bows, carving small items

These can be simple animation loops + occasional barks.

### Ambient Conversations

- Snippets about:
  - Hunts gone wrong/right
  - Strange sightings in the forest
  - Complaints and praise of the Ember Pot

Some lines can hint at Hunts, Deeds, or upcoming content.

## Festivals & Named Events

### 1. Ember Night Feast

**Concept:**
- A Lodge-wide feast event featuring Cooking, story, and buffed food.

**Triggers:**
- Periodic (e.g. in-world weekly cycle)
- Or triggered after big story beats (e.g. a major Deed or world boss kill)

**Activities:**

- Long tables set, Ember Pot visually upgraded with special FX.
- Special event recipes:
  - Group buff dishes
  - Limited-time feast foods

**Rewards:**

- Unique event-only recipes (cosmetic/sidegrade)
- Strong but time-limited food buffs
- Ember Kitchen rep (59)

---

### 2. Greatwood Remembrance

**Concept:**
- A quieter, somber festival remembering hunters and foresters lost.

**Triggers:**
- Tied to certain story beats (character deaths, big threats resolved).

**Activities:**

- Candles or lanterns lit around Lodge.
- NPCs stand in small groups sharing stories; some new dialogue.
- Player can participate in:
  - Placing names on a board or memorial
  - Bringing symbolic offerings (e.g., a crafted piece, a simple dish)

**Rewards:**

- Small rep boosts (Lodge-wide)
- Cosmetic items or titles:
  - Cloaks, pendants, keepsakes

**Tone:**
- Humanizing, slower pacing between hunts.

---

### 3. Wild Hunt Preparation

**Concept:**
- Build-up to a major Hunt or Deed, with the whole Lodge preparing.

**Triggers:**
- Before certain world bosses or big Deeds (61).

**Activities:**

- NPCs:
  - Sharpening weapons
  - Discussing tactics
  - Stockpiling rations
- Player tasks:
  - Provide food (Cooking)
  - Craft arrows or supplies (Woodworking)
  - Deliver special wood or herbs (Forester)

**Rewards:**

- Temporary buff for the upcoming hunt
- Hunt Board unlocks special Deed
- Profession rep and small gear upgrades

---

## Small Games & Activities

These should be light and optional but help sell the space.

### 1. Archery Mini-Game

- Simple target range behind or inside the Lodge.
- Player can:
  - Practice, get scored on accuracy/time.
- Rewards:
  - Tiny XP / coin
  - Titles/achievements or cosmetic target props at higher scores

### 2. Dice or Token Game

- Hunters play a simple dice or token-based game in a corner.
- Player can join:
  - Low-stakes gambling or just for fun.
- Rewards:
  - Mostly flavor
  - Occasional small item or rumor

### 3. Knife-Throwing / Hatchet-Throwing

- Target logs, chalked circles.
- Skill-based mini-activity using simple inputs (timing).
- Rewards:
  - Small rep with whoever runs it
  - Tiny buff (confidence, focus) for a short time

---

## Idle Details & Micro-Events

Examples:

- **Argument over a hunt** → short ambient scene.
- **Drunk hunter singing** → audio + minor interaction.
- **Lost kid in the Lodge** → tiny one-off fetch quest or escort.

These don’t need huge systems; they’re simple, authored scenes that rotate.

---

## System Hooks

- Festivals and social events can:
  - Temporarily change Lodge vendors’ inventories
  - Unlock limited-time Hunt Board entries
  - Gate certain profession recipes and cosmetics (59)

- Time-of-day:
  - Morning: preparations, bustle
  - Midday: training and craft focus
  - Night: stories, singing, arguments, quiet reflection

---

## Next Actions

- Decide on **1–2 festivals** to implement first (likely Ember Night Feast + Wild Hunt Prep).
- Define:
  - NPC schedules and simple states
  - Festival-specific dialogues and props
  - 1–2 small mini-games (archery, knife-throwing)
- Integrate social layer references into existing quests (56, 60) and rep tracks (59).
