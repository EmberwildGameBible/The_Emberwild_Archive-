# 64 – Greatwood Lodge Social Layer & NPC Routine System

## Purpose

Define the **social layer** of Greatwood Lodge as an actual system, not just a backdrop:

- Who lives/works here
- What they do across the day
- How they react to:
  - Hunts & Deeds (61–62)
  - Broken Tools & professions (52–57, 60)
  - Ember Pot state (85)
  - Trophies & quarters (86, B100)
  - Dynamic events & region state (62–63)

This file is the **behavior + relationship Bible** for the Lodge.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Lodge feels lived-in, not static**

   - NPCs move, talk, eat, work, sleep.
   - Same faces show up in believable places at believable times.

2. **Social progress is subtle but real**

   - As the player:
     - Hunts
     - Crafts
     - Solves problems
   - Lodge reactions update:
     - Barks
     - Conversations
     - Who invites you where.

3. **Systems, not one-off scripts**

   - Schedules
   - Affinity
   - Topic pools
   - Triggered scenes
   - Reusable across other Lodges later.

4. **Low friction, high flavor**

   - No “talk to 50 NPCs daily” chores.
   - Instead:
     - Natural chatter
     - Opt-in deeper talks
     - Social rewards mostly narrative/cosmetic.

5. **Supports player identity**

   - Social layer:
     - Recognizes your Hunts & Deeds
     - Mirrors room/trophy progression
     - Makes you feel like “one of the Lodge”.

## 1. Social NPC Types & Roles

### 1.1 Core Named NPCs (Anchors)

These are the **repeat faces** the player will know.

Each has:

- A **daily routine**
- A **relationship track** with the player (even if lightweight)
- A **topic pool** for:
  - Hunts
  - Deeds
  - Professions
  - Region events

### 1.2 Generic Lodge NPC Types

- Stablehands / quartermasters
- Visitors / traders
- Apprentices / initiates

Generic NPCs share **behavior templates** and **bark pools**.

---

## 2. Time-of-Day & Routine Structure

### 2.1 Day Segments

Divide Lodge day into **4–6 segments**:

1. **Dawn**
   - Hunters prepping to leave.
   - Light kitchen activity (strong coffee, simple food).
2. **Midday**
   - Some hunters out, some resting.
   - Active crafting & paperwork.
3. **Evening**
   - Hunters returning.
   - Ember Pot high activity, big social density.
4. **Late Night**
   - Reduced staff.
   - Night-watchers, insomniacs, scribes.

Optional finer segments if needed, but socially:

- Dawn & Evening are the **peak beats**.

### 2.2 Routine Template

Each NPC has:

- `home_location` – where they rest/sleep
- `work_locations[]` – where they perform duties
- `social_locations[]` – where they linger
- `schedule` – mapping day segment → location/activity
- `fallback_state` – what they do if something interrupts (alerts, events, story lockdown)

Example (Mara Emberpot):

- Dawn:
  - At Ember Pot hearth, brewing morning broth.
- Midday:
  - Kitchen prep, occasional trips to storeroom.
- Evening:
  - Ember Pot front & center, leading meals.
- Late Night:
  - At back table doing ledger on ingredients, occasionally sleeping in a chair.

---

## 4. Social Systems

### 4.1 Affinity / Relationship Tracks (Lightweight)

Rather than full romance/dating sim, use **low-complexity affinity**:

- `npc_affinity[player]` = small scalar (e.g. -2 → +5)
- Gains / losses from:
  - Consistently helping their profession
  - Choices in Deeds that align/oppose their values
  - Direct social choices (encourage, mock, ignore)

Effects:

- Unlocks **extra dialogue topics**
- Unlocks **micro-quests** (“Hey, can you look into X for me?”)
- Slightly changes **tone** of existing lines

No hard gameplay gating, mostly flavor and extra hooks.

---

### 4.2 Social Topics & Conversation Pools

Topics should be structured like:

- `topic_id`: e.g. `TOPIC_HUNT_BOARD_OVERVIEW`, `TOPIC_BROKEN_TOOLS_REFLECTION`
- `unlock_conditions`:
  - Minimum rep
  - Quest state
  - Time-of-day
- `lines[]`:
  - Short dialogues (2–6 lines)
  - Variants based on player state

Categories:

1. **Intro Topics**
   - “Who are you?”
   - “What is your role?”
2. **System Explainers**
   - Hunts
   - Deeds
   - Ember Pot
   - Attunement
3. **State Reactors**
   - “You just finished X Deed.”
   - “The Pot has Y dish going.”
   - “The forest is weird lately.”
4. **Personal History & Opinions**
   - Only partially unlocked; leave some mystery.

---

### 4.3 Barks vs Conversations

- **Barks:**
  - One-line, non-interactive.
  - Triggered by:
    - Proximity
    - Events (finishing Hunt, entering hall, etc).
- **Conversations:**
  - Player-initiated.
  - Offer dialogue choices occasionally.
  - Logically branch but converge to keep scope manageable.

Rules:

- Barks should not fire every 2 seconds:
  - Per-NPC cooldowns
  - Global “lodge chatter budget”
- Conversations:
  - Limited new topics per time period:
    - Avoid overwhelming content; slowly unlock.

---

## 5. Social Triggers & Reactions

### 5.1 Player Hunt & Deed Completion

When the player completes:

- A **Common Hunt**:
  - Nearby NPCs might:
    - Quick bark:
      - “Back from the Greybacks, I see.”

## 7. Technical Structure

### 7.1 NPC Definition

Each social NPC has:

- `npc_id`
- `name`
- `role_tags[]` – `["cook", "forester_lead", "rival_hunter"]`
- `schedule`:
  - `segment_id` → `location_id`, `activity_state`
- `affinity[player]` (if needed)
- `topic_unlocks[]` – list of topic IDs & conditions
- `bark_sets[]` – keyed by:
  - Time-of-day
  - Location
  - World state
- `scene_triggers[]` – micro-quests & story scenes.

### 7.2 Location & Activity States

For each `location_id` (from Lodge layout):

- `activity_states`:
  - `working`, `idle`, `eating`, `resting`, `alert`, etc.

Each combination:

- Has animation sets
- Has bark pools

### 7.3 Event Hooks

System events (Hunt/Deed completion, quest state, Ember Pot change) feed into:

- `social_event_bus`:
  - Broadcasts tags like:
    - `hunt_completed:CH-GW-001`
    - `deed_completed:D-GW-004`
    - `questline_state:broken_tools_completed`
    - `ember_pot:dish_changed:ASH_STEEPED`
- NPCs subscribed on:
  - Relevant tags:
    - Update their bark list
    - Enable/disable topics
    - Trigger one-time scenes.

---

## 8. Tone & Writing Guidelines

- **Grounded, not quippy.**
  - These are tired, practical people.
- **Short, loaded lines.**
  - NPCs don’t deliver monologues unless in special scenes.
- **Repetition with variation.**
  - Core sentiments return, but with small twists as world state changes.
- **Memory of the player’s actions.**
  - Social lines should:
    - Occasionally, not constantly, mirror the player’s history.

---

## 9. Next Actions

1. **Lock Lodge social map**:
   - Where does each role logically spend time?
2. **Define schedule data** for:
   - Mara, Arlen, Fen, Elira, Rival Hunter, 2–3 apprentices.
3. **Author bark pools** for:
   - Each time segment & key world states.
4. **Author 5–10 social conversations**:
   - One per anchor NPC focusing on:
     - Hunts, Deeds, Broken Tools, Ember Pot, Hollowroot foreshadow.
5. **Prototype 2–3 micro-quests** in the Lodge:
   - “A Bowl for the Road”
   - “The Apprentice’s First Cut”
   - “A Quiet Corner”
6. **Verify integration** with:
   - 85 Ember Pot events
   - 86 Trophy Hall
   - B100 quarters
   - 61–63 Hunts/Region layout.

File 64 should be treated as the **social nervous system** of Greatwood Lodge, ensuring everything you’ve built—Hunts, Deeds, tools, trophies, rooms, and the Pot—feels like it belongs to a community of people who live and remember alongside the player.
