# 100 – Personal Quarters, Hunter Customization, and Long-Term Identity in the Lodge

## Purpose

Define a **future system** for:

- Personal hunter quarters/room in or near the Lodge
- Visual and functional customization options
- How this ties into:
  - Trophies and achievements (86)
  - Professions and crafting (52–59, 95)
  - Festivals and Lodge social layer (64, 94)
  - Narrative recognition (83, 96)

Goal: give players a **persistent, evolving personal space** that reflects their journey, style, and impact on Emberwild.

## Core Concept

As the hunter rises in status:

- They earn access to:
  - A small room or quarters in the Lodge complex.
- Over time, that space:
  - Upgrades from a bare cot and trunk
  - Into a personalized den lined with:
    - Trophies.
    - Maps.
    - Crafted decor.
    - Emblems of big decisions and achievements.

This system is:

- Primarily cosmetic and identity-driven, with:
  - Light functional hooks (storage, small buffs, convenience).

## Functional Impact (Kept Small)

- Avoid turning room into mandatory power grind.

Light benefits only:

- Resting in your quarters:
  - Grants small “well-rested” buff (slight XP or stamina regen bonus).
- Planning table:
  - Minor quality-of-life:
    - More compact view of Hunts/Deeds.
- Small stash access:
  - Convenience, not game-breaking.
