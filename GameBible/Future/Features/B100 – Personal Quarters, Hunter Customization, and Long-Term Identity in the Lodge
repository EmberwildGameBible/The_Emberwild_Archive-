# B100 – Hunter’s Quarters: Layout, Unlocks, Trophies & Decor

## Purpose

Define the **player’s personal quarters inside Greatwood Lodge** as:

- A concrete, upgradable **physical space**
- A **visual log** of Hunts, Deeds, profession arcs, and story choices
- A light **functional hub** for storage, prep, and planning
- A **template** that future regions and Lodges can reuse

This file connects directly to:

- Greatwood Hunts & Deeds (61–62)
- Professions and Broken Tools of Greatwood (52–57, 60)
- Ember Pot and Lodge Social Layer (56, 64, 85–86)
- Dynamic Events and Greatwood Region layout (62–63)

---

## Design Goals

1. **Your room = your story**

   - The quarters visually show:
     - What you’ve killed
     - What you’ve crafted
     - What you’ve decided
   - Trophies and decor should be readable as a **timeline of play**.

2. **Small, grounded, and believable**

   - It’s a hunter’s room in a working Lodge, not a palace.
   - Upgrades should feel like:
     - Getting a better bunk
     - More wall space
     - Extra hooks, shelves, and storage

3. **Low friction, low chore**

   - Placing, swapping, and previewing decor is:
     - Fast
     - Reversible
   - No punishing “housing grind” around basics.

4. **System-connected but optional**

   - Light passive bonuses and narrative unlocks for engaging.
   - Players who ignore decor are not locked out of power.

5. **Reusable pattern**

   - B100 is the **base spec** for:
     - All future Lodge quarters
     - Possible larger player housing later

---

## 1. Physical Concept: Where and What

### 1.1 Location in Greatwood Lodge

- The player’s quarters are:
  - In a **hunter’s wing** of Greatwood Lodge.
  - Initially just another bunk room.
  - Over time, more clearly **their space**.

- Visual clues:
  - Nearby doors with other hunters’ names.
  - Hallway route from:
    - Lodge common hall
    - Past trophy displays
    - To quarters corridor

### 1.2 Baseline Room Layout

Core layout (top-down mental model):

- **Door Wall (North):**
  - Entry door
  - Small hook rack near door
  - Space for wall trophies / notices

- **Bed Wall (East):**
  - Cot/bed and trunk
  - Later: upgraded bed, under-bed storage

- **Work Wall (South):**
  - Desk / worktable
  - Shelves above
  - Possible map table or simple workbench

- **Trophy Wall (West):**
  - Dedicated wall section with:
    - Plaque rails
    - Pegs and mounts
    - Later: expanded frames, display stands

- **Center:**
  - Rug or floor space
  - Freestanding decor pieces (stool, small table, weapon stand)

Windows vary with upgrade tier (see progression below).

---

## 6. Social & Narrative Integration

### 6.1 NPC Visits

Certain quests and events can occur in the quarters:

- Friendly rival hunter:
  - Drops by to comment on new trophies or challenge you again.
- Apprentices:
  - Ask to see a specific trophy, or bring a small gift.
- Council/Lodge leadership:
  - Rare visits for important narrative beats.

Visits should:

- Respect time-of-day rules.
- Be opt-out capable (polite decline option).

### 6.2 Barks and Recognition

When key trophies are placed:

- Specific NPCs unlock context-aware lines:
  - “So that really was your work on the ash-creature.”
  - “I heard you hung that token where you’ll see it every morning.”

Room state can affect:

- How The Quiet Nod event (EVT-GW-SOC-05) is phrased.
- Which apprentices/peers admire or question your choices.

### 6.3 Light Buffs and Prep

The quarters are **not** a main power progression engine, but:

- Resting with certain decor combinations might grant:
  - Small, short-lived buff (e.g. morale, focus) that stacks with other pre-hunt prep.
- Simple pre-hunt rituals:
  - Sharpening at your weapon stand
  - Checking your map
  - Tasting a sample stew from the Emberbound Lid
- These create **ritual** without turning into a chore list.

---

## 7. Technical / Data Model Sketch

### 7.1 Room State

Per player, store:

- `quarters_tier` (0–4)
- `unlocked_slots[]`:
  - List of slot IDs available at this tier.
- `placed_items`:
  - Mapping:
    - `slot_id` → `item_id` (trophy or decor)
- `unlocked_items[]`:
  - Trophies & decor the player has earned.

### 7.2 Items

Common schema for trophies and decor:

- `item_id`
- `item_type` – `trophy` or `decor`
- `name`
- `slot_types_allowed[]`
- `size_class`
- `source` – quest, vendor, profession, etc.
- `effect_tags[]` – used to trigger narrative hooks and any small buffs.

### 7.3 UI & Placement Rules

- Click/press in room → opens **Quarters UI**:
  - Slot list
  - Available items per slot
  - Preview mode before committing
- Constraints:
  - Cannot place items you do not own.
  - Some trophies are unique (only 1 copy).
- Future-friendly:
  - Easy to add new items per region or for events.

---

## 8. Future Expansion Hooks

- **Additional Wings:**
  - Other Lodges, or:
    - Larger apartments
    - Remote hunting huts
  - Reuse same B100 structure with different art sets.

- **Co-op Viewing:**
  - Allow invited friends/party to visit:
    - Mostly cosmetic/social, no extra power.

- **Extended Systems:**
  - Trophy sets:
    - Minor cosmetics if you display specific combos.
  - Story flags:
    - Certain combinations might unlock hidden dialogue or micro-quests.

---

## 9. Next Actions

1. Lock **room footprint and camera angles** for each tier.
2. Define **exact slot positions and categories** in data.
3. Implement **initial trophy list** for:
   - Greatwood Deeds
   - Broken Tools questline
   - Early profession milestones
4. Implement a small **decor catalog** purchasable or craftable in Greatwood.
5. Wire up **NPC barks and micro-scenes** that reference:
   - Room tier
   - Visible key trophies
   - Player’s major decisions and titles.

B100 should be treated as the **baseline personal space spec**. Every new arc that matters to the player’s identity should consider whether it adds a **trophy** or **decor hook** to this system.
