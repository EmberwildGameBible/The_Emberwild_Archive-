# B162 – Lodge 1–20 – Structure, Upgrades, and Integration

## 0. Purpose

Define the **Lodge** for levels 1–20 as a real progression system, not just a backdrop:

- What the Lodge is and why it matters
- Physical structure and rooms
- Upgrade tiers from level 1 through 20
- How Lodge upgrades:
  - Tie into Hunts (B153–B159, B160)
  - Use ingredients (51 / 55)
  - Unlock recipes and brews (52 / 53 / 58)
  - Enable projects and rituals (57)
  - Reflect Greatwood region state (B151, B161)

This file is the **master Lodge reference** for the Greatwood 1–20 era.

## 1. Role of the Lodge in Emberwild

The Lodge is:

- The **player’s home base** in Greatwood.
- A **social and narrative hub** where NPCs gather, argue, drink, plan.
- A **progression hub** where:
  - Hunts are prepared and celebrated.
  - Food, brews, tools, trophies, and rituals tie together.

Design goals:

1. The Lodge should **visibly change** as the player progresses:
   - Trophies fill out.
   - Ember Pot and kitchen get busier.
   - Ward room and project boards get more complex.
2. The Lodge should **mechanically matter**:
   - Better Lodge = better buffs, projects, and tools.
3. The Lodge should **remember** what the player has done:
   - Hunts cleared.
   - Rituals performed.
   - Festivals or feasts held.

---

## 2. Physical Structure – Rooms and Their Jobs

At a high level, the Lodge building has:

1. Entry Hall / Common Room
2. Trophy Hall
3. Ember Pot and Kitchen
4. Workshop / Gear Corner

## 3. Lodge Tiers – 0 to 3/4

---

## 4. Integration With Hunts (B153–B159, B160) and Region (B161)

Lodge upgrades should respond to **what the player actually did**, not just XP.

### 4.1 Trophies and Hunt-Linked Upgrades

Each major Hunt:

- Unlocks at least one **trophy** and at least one **Lodge project**.

Examples:

- Elder Hollow Stag:

  - Trophy: Howler head mount and/or war banner.

- Shadow Under the Wardstone:

### 4.2 Region State Reflected in Lodge

Lodge should visually **echo** B161’s region state:

- When:

  - Hollowroot Matron is alive and active:
    - Hollowroot warning notes and maps pinned up in Lodge.
  - After Matron is killed:
    - New Hollowroot shrine / expedition table appears.

- When:

  - Black-Sap events escalate:
    - Black-Sap stains on some maps, extra barrels in yard.
  - After Devourer is killed:
    - Black-Sap plaque, Black-Sap kit storage racks appear.

- When:

  - Ragged King is active:
    - NPCs discuss bonepiles; maybe a warning notice by the door.
  - After King falls:
    - Bone throne and fractured bone art pieces appear.

These are mostly art/writing decisions but keep them **consistent** with B160 and B161.

## 8. How to Use This File Going Forward

Any time you:

- Add a **new Lodge project**:
  - Place it into:
    - Room,
    - Tier,
    - Hunt/theme loop in this doc.
- Add a **new Hunt or region system**:
  - Decide:
    - What it does for the Lodge,
    - What the Lodge does for it.
- Work on **visual or UX**:
  - Use this doc as “what should the Lodge show the player at this stage”.

B161 + B162 together describe:

- “What Greatwood is” (B161),
- “What the Lodge is, and how it grows with you” (B162).

They should stay in sync whenever Hunts, regions, or Lodge logic change.
