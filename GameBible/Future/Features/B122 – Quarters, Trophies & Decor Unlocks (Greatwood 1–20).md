# B122 – Quarters, Trophies & Decor Unlocks (Greatwood 1–20)
1. Purpose

Define how the player’s personal quarters and select Lodge spaces visually evolve across Greatwood 1–20 by:

Wiring Signature Hunts (B117–B121), contract packs (B115–B116), circles (B105, B110), events (B104), and projects (B102) directly into:

Room items.

Trophies.

Mementos.

Functional decor.

Making the quarters:

A snapshot of what the player has actually done.

A physical record of their choices and allegiances.

This is the unlock mapping and behavior, not the exact art bible.

2. Design Pillars

The Room Is a Storyboard

Anyone who walks into the player’s quarters should be able to tell:

Which Hunts they’ve completed.

Which circles they favor.

Which events they’ve lived through.

Roughly how they treat the world (merciful vs ruthless, etc.).

No Dead Unlocks

Every major:

Signature Hunt,

Circle trial,

Core event,

Key project

Unlocks at least one decor option.

Slots Over Hoarding

The room has slots:

Wall, Shelf, Centerpiece, Bed/Corner, Ward Niche, Window, Desk, Misc.

You choose which unlocks to display per slot.

You will always have more items than you can show at once.

Cosmetic First, Light Mechanical Second

Most decor is:

Visual and narrative.

A small subset:

Provides light, non-mandatory bonuses (resting buffs, minor social flags).

Reflect Choices, Not Just Checklists

Some items:

Mutually exclusive.

Variants based on:

How a Hunt was resolved.

Which side you favored in a dispute.

What you did with a particular event.

3. Quarters Layout & Slots (Greatwood Baseline)

Within Greatwood 1–20, assume the player’s room supports these core slots:

Wall – Trophy

1–2 large slots (heads, antlers, ward fragments, large symbols).

Shelf / Mantel

1–2 shelves for:

Small curios.

Books.

Trinkets.

Centerpiece

1 floor or hanging centerpiece:

Rug, small shrine, weapon stand, or table.

Bed / Corner Area

1 slot near bed:

Bed roll upgrade, pelt, chest, or personal banner.

Ward Niche

1 niche / alcove for:

Wardstone fragment.

Ritual focus.

Corruption curios.

Window / View

1 “view” slot:

Curtains, charms, small hanging objects.

Desk / Workspace

1 slot:

Maps, notes, field gear.

Misc / Hanging

1–2 smaller hooks:

Fangs, talismans, lanterns, dice bags, etc.

Some global items (like room size, extra shelves) are unlocked via Lodge Projects (B102). This doc focuses on what fills the slots once they exist.

4. Signature Hunt Trophy Unlocks

Each Greatwood Signature Hunt (B117–B121) provides:

At least one primary quarters item.

Sometimes multiple variants based on resolution.

A related item in common Lodge spaces if relevant (gallery, halls).

4.1 Black-Sap Devourer (B117)

Slot Focus: Wall – Trophy, Ward Niche, Desk.

Optional behavioral hook:
