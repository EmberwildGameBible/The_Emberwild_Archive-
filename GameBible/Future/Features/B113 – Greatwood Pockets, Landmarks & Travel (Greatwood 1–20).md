# B113 – Greatwood Pockets, Landmarks & Travel (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define the physical shape of Greatwood in the 1–20 band:

Core pockets / subregions and their:

Biome feel

Enemy themes

ZCL (Zone Corruption Level) ranges

Hunts & Signature Hunts (61, B103) presence

Profession nodes & materials (B108)

Key landmarks that:

Anchor navigation

Hold story beats, events, and projects

Travel flow:

How the player moves between Lodge, pockets, and key locations through Phases I–IV (B111)

Goal: make Greatwood feel like a real, navigable space whose layout reinforces:

Hunts

Corruption

Lodge identity

Player progression

Design Pillars

Readable but Organic

Greatwood is:

Cohesive, easily grokked as a region.

But not a perfect grid; it has choke points, loops, and secrets.

Every Pocket Has a Job

Each subregion:

Has a primary role:

Early Hunts

Corruption intro

Professions hotspot

Signature Hunt lair

AND at least one notable landmark or hook.

Corruption Gradients, Not Binary Zones

Corruption (ZCL) flows:

From “echoes” near the Lodge → deep pockets.

Visual & mechanical ramp consistent with:

B91 (Corruption).

B109 (status effects).

Travel is Story

The path between places is:

Where Hunts happen.

Where NPCs meet you.

Where the world evolves as corruption and projects progress.

Expandable Skeleton

B113 is the Greatwood 1–20 skeleton:

Later expansions can:

Attach new paths.

Raise ZCL caps.

Add deeper dungeons under or beyond existing pockets.

Macro Layout – Greatwood 1–20

Think of Greatwood as a rough wheel with the Lodge at its hub:

The Greatwood Lodge Ridge (Hub)

Radiating out:

Ridge Approach & Old Road (early Hunts, onboarding)

Ragged Verge (edge forest, general Hunts)

Black Sap Grove (corruption-heavy pocket)

Hollowroot Fringe → Hollowroot Warren (burrow dungeon)

Wardstone Hill (wards, Shadow Under the Wardstone)

Ember Run & Riverbanks (resource & travel path)

Hunter’s Crossroads / Waystones (mid-game hub branching)

We define each as a pocket or cluster with clear function.
