# 84 – Lodge Economy, Vendors, and Currencies (Greatwood 1–20)

## Purpose

Define the **economy backbone** for Greatwood & the Lodge:

- What currencies/resources matter
- How vendors are structured
- How players **earn and spend** in ways that:
  - Feel grounded in hunter life
  - Support progression pacing
  - Avoid “vendor trash” syndrome as much as possible

Goal: create an economy that feels like **running a Lodge community**, not shopping at a theme park mall.

---

## Core Economic Concepts

1. **Primary Currency: Coin/Scrip**
   - Simple, universal **coin** or Lodge **scrip** for basic trade.

2. **Secondary Value: Resources & Ingredients**
   - Wood, meat, hides, mushrooms, herbs, etc. are:
     - Trade goods
     - Crafting resources
   - Often more valuable when processed (cooked, dried, crafted) than raw.

3. **Reputation as Economic Access (59)**
   - Higher rep:
     - Unlocks better vendor stock.
     - Improved trade terms in certain cases.

4. **No Infinite Gold Faucets**
   - Greatwood 1–20:
     - Modest coin acquisition.
     - Emphasis on using what you bring home.

## Spending Money in Greatwood 1–20

### Player “Bills” / Sinks (But Not Actual Bills)

## Economic Philosophy

- **Coin is useful but not everything:**
  - Some items are:
    - Non-purchasable.
    - Only obtainable via Hunts/Deeds/Professions (rare recipes, boss trophies).

- **Self-sufficiency is powerful:**
  - Player who invests in:
    - Cooking.
    - Woodworking.
    - Forester loops.
  - Can produce:
    - Their own food, traps, arrows, and some gear.

- **But time is a resource:**
  - Buying some items is:
    - A time/effort shortcut.

---

## Rarity & Vendor Behavior

### Stock Rotation

- Quartermaster:
  - Has stable standard inventory.
  - Occasionally rotates a few “special” items.

- Profession vendors:
  - Stable base patterns.
  - Rare patterns unlocked by:
    - High rep.
    - Event-specific conditions (festivals, story beats).

### Scarcity

- Certain items:
  - Explicitly never sold (e.g., Hollowroot boss trophies).
- Certain ingredients:
  - Only sold in small amounts, high price, to preserve their value in the world.

---

## Integration With Systems

- **Loot & Item Ecosystem (1.4):**
  - Vendors do NOT replace drops:
    - They complement them.
- **Professions (52–57, 59):**
  - Economy incentivizes:
    - Using professions for value generation, not just power.
- **Hunts & Deeds (61, 66):**
  - Structured reward flow:
    - XP + coin + rep + chance at valuable items.
- **Lodge Social Layer (64):**
  - Festivals:
    - Temporary vendor stalls.
    - Occasional discounts or unique items → good coin sink moments.
- **Talents & Growth (82):**
  - Path of the Lodge perks:
    - Slightly improve economic efficiency (gather more, waste less).

---

## Avoiding Vendor Trash Syndrome

- Items should generally have:
  - Clear use-cases:
    - Crafting, cooking, alchemy, quests, or decorative.
- When an item is **mainly sell-fodder**, make that:
  - Diegetic:
    - “This is mostly used for trade.”
  - Limited:
    - Don’t flood the game with tons of low-value clutter.

---

## Next Actions

- Define:
  - Baseline coin reward ranges for:
    - Small hunts
    - Medium hunts
    - Deeds
- Create:
  - Vendor inventory tables:
    - Quartermaster Tier 0–2.
    - Profession vendors per rep rank.
- Decide:
  - Final naming:
    - “Coin” vs “Lodge Scrip” vs something else.
  - Any special token system (if any) for rare Deed rewards.
