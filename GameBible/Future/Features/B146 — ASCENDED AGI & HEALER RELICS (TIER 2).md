# B146 — ASCENDED AGI & HEALER RELICS (TIER 2)

This chapter defines the Tier 2 Ascended forms for:

Skyshatter Huntbow (AGI Ranged)

Nightveil Prowler (AGI Melee)

Dawnsong Covenant (Healer Mace)

Heartroot Reliquary (Healer Trinket)

Each follows the Tier 2 rules from B145:

Level cap still 60.

Requires Core of Convergence + zone relic cores (Emberforge / Frostheart / Sovereign / Heartroot etc.).

Each relic splits into two specialization paths.

Ascended relics are new items that share the same Relic Mastery track.

1. Skyshatter Huntbow Ascension (AGI Ranged)
1.1 Base T1 Reminder

Skyshatter Huntbow (T1):

Stats: strong AGI, RAP, crit, hit.

Hunter’s Focus — crits build stacks, 5 stacks empower next special shot (+30% damage + slow).

Skystrider — +movespeed while at range, reduced fall damage.

T2 branches push:

Stormstrider Skyshatter — kiting god, chase-and-kite with big slows.

Skyshatter, Apex Fang — single-target boss delete / apex hunter fantasy.

1.2 Stormstrider Skyshatter (Kiting / Control)

Stormstrider Skyshatter
Tier 2 Legendary · Bow · AGI Ranged (kite/control)

Stats:

+54 Agility

+40 Stamina

+124 Ranged Attack Power

+4% Ranged Crit Chance

+2% Hit Chance

Passive — Endless Skystride:

Replaces / upgrades Skystrider:

While in combat and more than 10 studs away from your current target:

+8% movement speed (up from +5%).

+8% snare resistance (you are slowed less).

If no enemies are within 5 studs:

Gain an additional +4% ranged haste.

Passive — Tempest Mark:

When you consume 5 stacks of Hunter’s Focus:

Empowered shot:

Deals +30% base bonus damage (unchanged).

Applies Tempest Mark for 8 seconds:

Target is slowed by 50% (up from 40%).

Each subsequent ranged attack refreshes the slow (but not the duration).

If the target dies while Tempest Mark is active:

You gain Skybreaker’s Momentum:

+10% movement speed and +10% crit chance for 6 seconds.

This path is about chasing and kiting apex targets, perfect for solo play and mobile fights.

1.3 Skyshatter, Apex Fang (Single-Target Predator)

Skyshatter, Apex Fang
Tier 2 Legendary · Bow · AGI Ranged (ST burst / execution)

Stats:

Deals +40% bonus damage (up from 30%).

If the target is above 80% HP:

Applies Opening Wound:

+10% damage taken from your ranged attacks for 6 seconds.

Passive — Last Light of the Hunt:

Your ranged attacks deal +8% increased damage.

If an empowered Apex Strike kills the target:

You gain Predator’s Calm:

This path is the “delete bosses & priority targets” version.

1.4 Ascension Trial: Shattered Sky Reborn

Instance: INSTANCE_SKYSHATTER_ASCENSION_TRIAL

Framework:

You revisit elements of the Shattered Sky Hunt but tuned harder.

Three phases:

Hunt of Distance — survive chasing aerial/fast beasts without letting them reach you more than X times.

Hunt of Opening — burst down a set of targets quickly as they spawn, using empowered shots to break shields.

Hunt of Endings — long boss that tests execute damage and positioning.

At the final altar, you choose Stormstrider or Apex Fang.

2. Nightveil Prowler Ascension (AGI Melee)
2.1 Base T1 Reminder

Nightveil Prowler (T1):

Stats: strong AGI, AP, crit, hit.

Prowler’s Bleed — attacks from stealth (or 3s after) apply stacking bleed (up to 3).

Slip Through Shadows — on killing blow gain speed + dodge (ICD 20s).

T2 branches:

Nightveil, Knife in the Dark — surgical, heavy opener + bleed ramp on single target.

Nightveil, Streets of Knives — tempo assassinations, small cleave, chain-pull flows.

2.2 Nightveil, Knife in the Dark (Single-Target Assassin)

Nightveil, Knife in the Dark
Tier 2 Legendary · Dagger · AGI Melee (ST / opener)

+110 Attack Power

+4% Crit Chance

Instantly applies 2 stacks of Nightveil Bleed.

Passive — Still Heart:

For 4 seconds after leaving stealth:

This path is about deadly openers and long bleeds on single targets (bosses, key elites).

2.3 Nightveil, Streets of Knives (Cleave / Tempo)

Nightveil, Streets of Knives
Tier 2 Legendary · Dagger · AGI Melee (cleave / chain pulls)

Stats:

+52 Agility

+36 Stamina

+110 Attack Power

+3% Crit Chance

This path is for running dungeons, catacombs, and trash-heavy content like a blender.

2.4 Ascension Trial: The Silent Conspiracy

Instance: INSTANCE_NIGHTVEIL_ASCENSION_TRIAL

Framework:

Stealth-heavy scenario with branching objectives:

The First Cut — assassinate three lieutenants in different “wings” with no alarm.

The Street of Whispers — move through a packed street using stealth, opportunistic kills, and chain buffs.

The Last Witness — boss fight that has a “shadow copy” mechanic; more adds → better for Streets path, minimal detection → better for Knife path.

Choice at the end: Knife in the Dark or Streets of Knives.

3. Dawnsong Covenant Ascension (Healer Mace)
3.1 Base T1 Reminder

Dawnsong Covenant (T1):

Stats: INT/SPI/STA, SP, +2% Healing, mp5.

Dawnsong Chorus — overhealing on a target converts partially into a shield (cap, ICD).

Covenant of Respite — below 30% HP: next heal within 6s is +20% stronger (ICD 20s).

T2 branches:

Dawnsong, Beacon of the Faithful — clutch single-target saves / tank healer.

Dawnsong, Choir of Dawn — raid-wide HoT & group throughput.

3.2 Dawnsong, Beacon of the Faithful (Single-Target Guardian)

Dawnsong, Beacon of the Faithful
Tier 2 Legendary · 1H Mace · Healer (tank / single-target)

Stats:

+46 Intellect

+40 Spirit

+32 Stamina

+84 Spell Power

+3% Healing Done

+10 Mana per 5 sec

Passive — Beacon’s Aegis:

When Covenant of Respite would trigger (ally below 30% HP):

The bonus heal is now +30% (up from 20%).

The target also gains Beacon’s Aegis:

A shield equal to 10% of their max HP for 8 seconds.

This shield stacks with Dawnsong Chorus (different effect).

Internal cooldown: 20 sec (unchanged).

Passive — Steadfast Vows:

While at least one Beacon’s Aegis shield is active on any ally:

You gain +5% damage reduction.

Your cast time on single-target heals is reduced by 5%.

This path is a tank / focused target savior.

3.3 Dawnsong, Choir of Dawn (Raid Healer)

Dawnsong, Choir of Dawn
Tier 2 Legendary · 1H Mace · Healer (raid HoT/ throughput)

Stats:

+48 Intellect

+38 Spirit

+30 Stamina

+84 Spell Power

+3% Healing Done

+12 Mana per 5 sec

Passive — Dawnsong Resonance:

In addition, when Dawnsong Chorus is applied to a target:

20% of the shield value is also applied as a small shield to up to 2 nearby allies (within 8 studs).

Passive — Morning Choir:

Every time you apply a new HoT to three or more allies within 4 seconds:

Trigger Choir Echo:

All of your active HoTs tick once immediately (mini free tick).

Internal cooldown: 15 seconds.

This path scales in group content, rewarding smart HoT spreading and raid coverage.

3.4 Ascension Trial: Vigil at First Light

Instance: INSTANCE_DAWNSONG_ASCENSION_TRIAL

Framework:

Defense / escort style scenario with a mix of:

Single important NPC (good for Beacon),

Larger group of fragile NPCs (good for Choir).

Phases:

Solitary Watch — guard a lone Warden in a multi-wave fight where they frequently dip low.

Choir of the Lost — multiple NPCs channel a ritual, all taking periodic damage.

The Last Bell — final boss with raid-style AoE pulses and tank busters.

Choice at end: Beacon of the Faithful vs Choir of Dawn.

4. Heartroot Reliquary Ascension (Healer Trinket)
4.1 Base T1 Reminder

Heartroot Reliquary (T1):

Stats: modest INT/SPI/STA, +1% Healing Done.

Roots of Recovery — HoTs have a chance to “bloom” and instantly heal a chunk of remaining HoT value (ICD per target).

Use — Heartroot Bloom (2 min CD) — 12s of HoTs ticking 30% faster (shorter duration, same total healing but faster delivery).

T2 branches:

Heartroot, Bloom Eternal — pushes HoT blooms and reactive healing windows.

Heartroot, Seed of Sanctuary — adds DR/regen aura vibe.

4.2 Heartroot, Bloom Eternal (HoT Burst)

Heartroot, Bloom Eternal
Tier 2 Legendary · Trinket · Healer (HoT-focused burst)

Stats:

+28 Intellect

+24 Spirit

+22 Stamina

+2% Healing Done

Passive — Eternal Bloom:

Roots of Recovery upgraded:

Bloom chance increased.

Bloom now heals for a flat amount + 40% of remaining HoT value (up from “chunk” baseline).

When a Bloom triggers on a target below 50% HP:

That target gains Bloomguard:

+5% damage reduction for 6 seconds.

Use — Verdant Surge (2 min CD):

Replaces Heartroot Bloom active:

For 10 seconds:

Your HoTs tick 40% faster (more front-loaded).

Their total healing is increased by 10% (not just reshaped).

This path reinforces the “HoT god / spike stabilizer” role.

4.3 Heartroot, Seed of Sanctuary (Aura / DR Healer)

Heartroot, Seed of Sanctuary
Tier 2 Legendary · Trinket · Healer (DR aura / regen)

Stats:

+24 Intellect

+26 Spirit

+24 Stamina

+1% Healing Done

+6 Mana per 5 sec

Passive — Sanctuary Root:

While in combat and Heartroot is equipped:

You project a Sanctuary aura (radius ~15 studs):

Allies inside take 3% reduced damage.

This stacks multiplicatively with other DR, but modest.

Use — Heartroot Sanctuary (2.5 min CD):

Plant a spectral Heartroot at your location (10 seconds):

Allies standing within 10 studs of the Heartroot:

Take an additional 5% reduced damage.

Receive a small HoT (scales with Spirit).

You can move out, the Seed stays at the planted spot.

This path makes you a zone-based anchor healer, great for raids and fixed-position fights.

4.4 Ascension Trial: Echoes of the First Grove

Instance: INSTANCE_HEARTROOT_ASCENSION_TRIAL
(can be an upgraded / extended version of the original Reliquary questline)

Framework:

Overworld + instance hybrid:

Cleanse Three Groves — each with different damage pattern (DoT heavy, burst spikes, constant AoE).

Guard the Sapling — single location defense with waves and environmental hazards.

The Root of Rot — boss that specifically punishes bad positioning; players safer in your Sanctuary zone.

Choice at the end: Bloom Eternal vs Seed of Sanctuary.
