# B107 – Greatwood Gear & Loot Themes (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define the gear & loot identity of Greatwood 1–20:

What kinds of weapons, armor, trinkets, and charms exist in this band.

How loot is themed around:

Hunts & Signature Hunts (61, B103)

Lodge circles & rep (59)

Corruption & Warding (91, B101)

Events & projects (B102, B104)

What tiers of gear are expected by level 20, and how players get them:

Drops, crafting, Lodge vendors, contracts.

This is not a full numeric itemization spreadsheet, but a thematic & structural spec for early-game loot.

Design Pillars

Every Piece Tells You Where It Came From

Greatwood gear should look and feel:

Forest-born.

Hunt-earned.

Lodge-stamped.

You should be able to guess:

“That’s a Warden piece.”

“That came from Hollowroot.”

“That’s from a Feast or Vigil.”

Fewer, Better Items

Early game avoids:

Loot spray.

Dozens of junk variants.

Instead:

Small, curated set of named items & families.

Clear upgrades through tiers.

Loot as a Mirror of Your Path

What you wear reflects:

Circle alignment.

Willingness to embrace or reject corruption tools.

Preference for stealth, brutality, support, etc.

Combat + Identity, Light on Raw Power Creep

Stat upgrades matter.

But identity tags (perks, traits, flavor) matter more:

“Warden-etched, corruption-resist gear.”

“Huntmaster’s predator gear.”

“Scholar’s tinkered tools.”

Expandable Without Restarting the Pyramid

B107 defines:

Base archetypes and families.

Future regions:

Add new families and tiers.

Build on these tags and structures.

Gear Types in Greatwood Slice

We assume the game has a broader gear taxonomy; Greatwood 1–20 focuses on:

Weapons

Armor Sets

Charms & Trinkets

Tools & Offhand Items

Each item can carry:

Base stats: damage, armor, etc.

Tag(s) for:

Region (Greatwood).

Source (Hunt, corruption, Lodge circle).

Family (Hollowroot, Black Sap, Ward, etc).

1–2 simple traits (if rare/unique):

Minor on-hit effect.

Small conditional bonus.

Thematic perk (tracking, warding, etc).

1. Early Weapon Themes

We define families of weapons rather than an explosion of uniques:

Weapon Families (Greatwood 1–20)

Ridgewood Hunter Gear

Hollowroot Burrow Gear

Black Sap Corrupted Gear

Ward-etched Arms

Scholar’s Tinkered Implements

Festival & Story Curios

Each family has multiple weapon types (e.g., blade, bow, hammer, etc.) sharing:

Visual motifs.

Flavor text themes.

Simple family-level trait.

1.1 Ridgewood Hunter Gear

Theme: Traditional Greatwood hunter craft. Reliable, balanced gear built from local beasts and timber.

Source:

Early Hunts (wolves, boars, basic beasts).

Lodge general vendors.

Basic crafting recipes.

Visual:

Sturdy, practical.

Wood handles, leather wraps, simple metal heads.

Occasional beast-claw inlays or tooth fetishes.

Family Trait (soft concept):

“Clean Kill”:

Slight bonus vs un-corrupted beasts.

Encourages their use in early, non-corruption Hunts.

Example Weapons

Ridgewood Longknife

Type: light melee / sidearm.

Tag: FAMILY_RIDGEWOOD, GREATWOOD_CORE.

Flavor:

“Half knife, half tool, all backbone of the Lodge.”

Use:

Starter or early upgraded blade.

Ridgewood Shortbow

Type: bow.

Flavor:

“From the same trees that roof the Lodge.”

Trait:

Slight bonus to tracking shots or opening attacks.

Ridgewood Handaxe

Type: 1H axe.

Flavor:

“Splits wood as well as skulls.”

Trait:

Minor extra resource gain from logging / salvage (if professions hooked).

These make up the baseline of your arsenal in early Greatwood.

1.2 Hollowroot Burrow Gear

Theme: Gear crafted from Hollowroot creatures — chitin, hardened resin, fungal leather.

Source:

Drops & crafting from Hollowroot Warren (65/77).

Signature Hunt: Hollowroot Matron (B103).

Some Lodge Projects (B102) after the Warren is “managed”.

Visual:

Organic, segmented shapes.

Slightly unsettling, bug-like silhouettes.

Earthy, mushroomy color palette.

Family Trait:

“Burrowborn”:

Slight improvements to:

Tunnel / underground combat (e.g., stamina cost reduction on dodges, or mild resistance to certain burrower attacks).

Example Weapons

Hollowroot Carapace Blade

Type: medium melee blade.

Flavor:

“Gentler than the Matron who wore it first.”

Trait:

Small bonus damage vs Hollowroot-type enemies.

Warren-Stinger Spear

Type: spear / polearm.

Flavor:

“Balanced for lunging down narrow warrens.”

Trait:

Slightly extended reach in cramped spaces.

Chitin-Weighted Club

Type: blunt weapon.

Flavor:

“Heavy enough to crack shell and bone alike.”

Trait:

Minor stagger bonus vs armored enemies.

These weapons are mid-tier and clearly identify you as someone who has braved the Warren.

1.3 Black Sap Corrupted Gear

Theme: Risky gear touched by Black Sap corruption — powerful but unsettling.

Source:

Drops & crafting from Black Sap Grove.

Signature Hunt: Black-Sap Devourer.

Restricted Lab experiments (B101).

Visual:

Dark resinous surfaces.

Pulsing veins of black / purple.

Subtle glow or sheen in the right light.

Family Trait:

“Sap-Drunk”:

Mild offensive boost (e.g., damage vs corrupted enemies) at the cost of:

Slightly higher HCL gain, or

Occasional minor self-afflictions (brief visual distortions).

Example Weapons

Devourer’s Fang Blade

Type: curved blade.

Flavor:

“The sap never quite washed off.”

Trait:

Slight bonus vs corrupted enemies; small chance to inflict a minor corruption DoT.

Slight increase in HCL gain while wielded.

Black-Sap Hunting Bow

Type: bow.

Trait:

Corruption-tinged arrows:

Slight chance to slow corrupted targets with sticky sap.

Resin-Heart Maul

Type: heavy blunt weapon.

Trait:

On heavy hit vs corrupted foes:

Small chance to “splinter” corruption, momentarily weakening nearby corrupted enemies.

Mild extra HCL gain on repeated use.

Black Sap gear is opt-in risk: players choosing more aggressive anti-corruption tools at some personal mental cost.

1.4 Ward-Etched Arms

Theme: Weapons etched and blessed by Wardens — safe, steady, anti-corruption focused.

Source:

Wardens’ Circle rep vendors (59).

Warding projects rewards (B101/B102).

Gloaming Vigil participation (B104).

Visual:

Less organic, more refined.

Simple metal and wood with etched glyphs or stones.

Sometimes faintly glowing under corruption stress.

Family Trait:

“Ward-Etched”:

Mild resistance to corruption debuffs.

No extra HCL gain, sometimes slight reduction in ambient HCL buildup.

Example Weapons

Warden’s Sigilblade

Type: straight sword or longsword.

Flavor:

“Meant to be carried where the air grows thin and wrong.”

Trait:

Slight reduction in duration of certain corruption DoTs on the wielder.

Ward-String Longbow

Type: bow.

Trait:

Arrows fired have a small chance to briefly “pin” corrupted minions to ground.

Stonebound Hammer

Type: hammer.

Trait:

Extra damage to corruption nodes and ward-tampering structures.

Ward-etched gear is the safe counterpoint to Black Sap — less raw risk, but also less raw aggression.

1.5 Scholar’s Tinkered Implements

Theme: Odd, experimental weapons and tools tuned by Scholars & the Fringe Alchemist.

Source:

Scholar rep.

Research projects (B101).

Restricted Lab experiments (risky).

Visual:

Joints, bolts, extra moving bits.

Occasional flasks or runestones attached.

Clearly “prototype” energy.

Family Trait:

“Prototype”:

Minor random elements:

e.g., on-hit side effects that can be slightly unpredictable but mostly beneficial.

Example Weapons / Tools

Adjustable Beast-Hunter

Type: modular crossbow / hybrid tool.

Trait:

Occasional bonus effect based on current target type:

Slight bonus vs beasts OR corrupted OR “humanoid” depending on loadout & research state.

Lab-Tuned Rod

Type: staff / rod.

Trait:

Mild synergy with certain brews:

If certain Alchemy buffs active, rod attacks gain extra small elemental/utility flavor.

These are niche, fun options for players leaning into Scholars & experimentation.

1.6 Festival & Story Curios (Weapons)

Theme: Odd weapons associated with festivals and story arcs.

Source:

Ember Feast rewards.

Story beats (e.g., Shadow Under the Wardstone).

Examples:

Feast-Day Butcher’s Cleaver

Type: short chopping blade.

Source:

Ember Feast contracts.

Trait:

Slight bonus vs beasts specifically when a Feast buff is active.

Wardstone-Shadow Dagger

Type: dagger.

Source:

Shadow Under the Wardstone arc, depending on choices.

Trait:

Dip into either:

Warden-aligned anti-corruption dagger, or

Slightly “off” dagger with stealth / corruption concealed synergy.

These should be rare & memorable, not standard issue.

2. Armor & Outfit Sets

Armor visually defines “who you roll with.” We define a few light/medium armor sets for 1–20:

Armor Families

Basic Lodge Leathers

Hunter’s Ridge Set

Hollowroot Surcoat & Shell

Wardens’ Guard

Scholar’s Field Garb

Festival Attire & Tokens

Each family can have:

Light/medium variants.

Partial set bonuses (if wearing multiple pieces).

Thematic perks.

2.1 Basic Lodge Leathers

Theme: Starter set, issued to new hunters.

Visual:

Plain leather, simple plates.

Lodge crest patch.

Traits:

None or tiny baseline buff.

Very subtle HP / stamina baseline.

Used mostly at the very start.

2.2 Hunter’s Ridge Set

Theme: The “real hunter” look. Built from early beasts + Lodge craft.

Source:

Ridgewood beasts.

Regular Hunts.

Huntmasters rep.

Visual:

Leather with layered fur shoulders.

Reinforced bracers and boots with claws/teeth decorations.

Set Concept:

3–4 pieces (chest, legs, gloves, boots).

Wearing 2+ pieces:

Slight stamina efficiency bonus during Hunts.

Wearing full set:

Minor bonus to beast tracking interaction (e.g., easier to see tracks in tracking mode).

This is the first “you look like a hunter” set.

2.3 Hollowroot Surcoat & Shell

Theme: Armor shaped from Hollowroot chitin and fungal leather.

Source:

Hollowroot Warren materials.

Matron Hunt (B103).

Some research projects.

Visual:

Organic plates, layered chitin segments.

Certain pieces have small fungal growths or spore patches (purely visual).

Set Concept:

Some pieces are more protective vs piercing/poison.

Wearing multiple pieces:

Slight reduction in burrower/spore damage.

Wearing full set:

Improve resistance to certain Warren hazards (tunnels, spore traps).

Represents deep entanglement with the Warren.

2.4 Wardens’ Guard

Theme: Wardens’ official anti-corruption armor.

Source:

Wardens rep.

Warding projects outcomes.

Vigil participation.

Visual:

Simple, disciplined design.

Plate or hardened leather with ward glyph plating.

Cloak or tabard with Warden symbol.

Set Concept:

Partial set:

Mild corruption resistance.

Full set:

Small reduction in HCL gain in ZCL ≥ 1 areas.

Slightly better survival in corruption surges/Vigil events.

For players who lean heavily into “Warden of Wards” identity.

2.5 Scholar’s Field Garb

Theme: Armor for those who poke things they shouldn’t, but try not to die doing it.

Source:

Scholar rep.

Research / lab projects.

Scholar’s Exhibition event (B104).

Visual:

Layered tunics, pouches, strapped-on journals.

Some strange bracers or lenses mounted on shoulders/hoods.

Set Concept:

Partial set:

Slight bonus to loot drops of research-relevant items (samples, notes).

Full set:

Slight speed or visibility bonus for tracking mode.

Maybe tiny buff to Alchemy effect durations.

A strong identity set for Scholar-aligned players.

2.6 Festival Attire & Tokens (Armor Adjacent)

Rather than full combat armor, these are overlay pieces or small visuals:

Feast sash.

Vigil cloak.

Event pins.

These may:

Occupy cosmetic/overlay slots.

Have no combat effect, or at most:

Slight festival-specific buffs (Feast XP, Vigil HCL, etc).

3. Charms & Trinkets

Charms are small wearable items focused on traits, not raw stats:

Sources

Hunts & trophies.

Labs & research.

Warding projects.

Events & festivals.

Social arcs (B105).

Examples

Howler Fang Charm

Source:

Greatwood Howler.

Effect:

Minor bonus vs beast-type enemies.

Flavor:

“Worn by those who remember the echoes on the ridges.”

Sap-Bound Bead Strand

Source:

Sap purification experiment.

Effect:

Slight bonus damage vs corrupted enemies.

Slightly higher HCL gain while equipped.

Warden’s Knot Charm

Source:

Warden rep milestone.

Effect:

Tiny reduction in corruption debuff durations.

Scholar’s Lens Pendant

Effect:

Slightly longer “highlight” duration on clues while tracking.

Feast Day Token

Source:

Ember Feast.

Effect:

Tiny rep bonus with Lodge Proper while active.

Players can equip only a few (1–2) trinkets early on, forcing a choice:

Anti-corruption vs anti-beast vs social vs research.

4. Tools & Offhand Items

These are non-primary items that support Hunts, tracking, and field survival:

Examples

Hunter’s Spyglass

Use:

Better long-range spotting.

Source:

Lodge vendor / project reward.

Minor mechanical:

Slightly increases reveal radius of points of interest.

Field Ward Stone

Use:

Short-lived micro-ward in small radius.

Source:

Warden projects and contracts.

Mechanical:

Temporarily slow HCL gain / very small ZCL dampening in a tiny bubble.

Sample Satchel

Use:

Hold more research samples.

Source:

Lab projects / Scholar rep.

Mechanical:

Expand capacity for special loot category (specimens).

Festival Drum / Flute

Use:

Purely cosmetic emote item.

Source:

Ember Feast or Lodge social projects.

These tools are highly situational and lean into identity rather than raw DPS.

5. Loot Acquisition Structure (Greatwood 1–20)

We want early-game loot to feel earned and readable, not RNG soup.

Major Acquisition Channels

Hunt Drops (61, B103)

Signature Hunts:

Always drop:

A trophy path.

At least a chance at a family-defining weapon or charm.

Standard Hunts:

Drop base materials for crafting families (Ridgewood, Hollowroot, etc).

Crafting & Professions (forward ref to 95)

Professions turn:

Beast parts + herbs + wood → gear pieces in each family.

Lodge vendors unlock:

New recipes based on rep & projects.

Lodge Vendors & Circle Shops (59)

Lodge Proper:

Baseline supplies, early Ridgewood gear.

Huntmasters:

Hunt-focused upgrades & trophies.

Wardens:

Ward-etched arms & guard armor.

Scholars:

Prototypes, odd field tools, research gear.

Events, Festivals, & Projects (B102, B104)

Ember Feast:

Feast weapons and cosmetic gear.

Gloaming Vigil:

Warden-aligned anti-corruption pieces.

Lodge Projects:

New stock and upgrades in vendors when certain projects complete.

Corruption & Lab Experiments (91, B101)

Corruption experiments produce:

Black Sap gear.

Corruption-themed charms.

Risky choice:

More powerful specialized gear with potential downsides.

6. Tiering Expectations by Level 20

Without hard numbers, we can define qualitative tiers:

Tier 0 – Starter / Basic Lodge Leathers, starter Ridgewood weapon.

Tier 1 – Ridgewood Hunter gear, basic charms, first real Lodge pieces.

Tier 2 – Hollowroot family weapons/armor, Ward-etched baseline arms, Scholar field pieces.

Tier 3 (within Greatwood) – Signature Hunt and corruption-themed gear (Devourer, Matron, Howler, Ragged King paths), Gloaming Vigil & advanced ward gear.

By level 20, a typical player might be:

Wearing:

Mix of Tier 2/3 armor sets reflecting their alignment.

Using:

1–2 signature weapons from:

Ridgewood, Hollowroot, Black Sap, Warden, Scholar, or story families.

Equipped:

1–2 trinkets that lean into their chosen identity:

Beast-slayer.

Corruption hunter.

Scholar.

Social hero, etc.

7. Integration With Other Features
With 1.4 Item Ecosystem (Global)

B107 refines the Greatwood slice of the global item ecosystem.

Families like:

Ridgewood, Hollowroot, Black Sap, Ward-etched, Scholar prototypes
plug directly into:

Global item tier/affix logic defined in 1.4.

With 58 – Alchemy

Many items require:

Alchemical components to craft/upgrade.

Some gear traits:

Interact with Alchemy buffs (e.g., Scholar’s rod, some trinkets).

With 59 – Lodge Rep & Circles

Circle-specific gear & visuals:

Huntmaster, Warden, Scholar sets.

Rep lock:

Certain items only appear at specific circle rank thresholds.

With 61 & B103 – Hunts

Signature Hunts:

Primary drivers for family-defining weapons/charms.

Hunt tiers:

Influence drop rarity and family type.

With 91 & B101 – Corruption & Warding

Ward-etched vs Black Sap gear:

Direct expression of approach to corruption.

Warding Wing:

Uses gear as rewards for projects.

With B100 / B106 – Quarters

Trophies & gear families:

Reflected in room decor (B106).

Signature Hunt gear:

Iconic enough to appear visually in your space.

With B104 – Events & Festivals

Ember Feast & Gloaming Vigil:

Provide festival gear and ward/festival-themed items.

With B105 – Social Systems

NPC rumors:

Reference what you’re wearing, especially:

Signature trophies.

Black Sap or Ward-etched gear.

Epithets:

May be partially derived from gear choices over time (e.g., always wearing Black Sap stuff → more “reckless” or “Fringe-aligned” gossip).
