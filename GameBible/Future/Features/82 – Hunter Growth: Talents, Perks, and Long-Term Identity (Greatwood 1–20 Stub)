# 82 – Hunter Growth: Talents, Perks, and Long-Term Identity (Greatwood 1–20 Stub)

## Purpose

Define the **early talent/perk framework** for Emberwild:

- How players grow beyond raw level and gear
- How talents express **hunter identity**:
  - Melee vs Ranged
  - Fieldcraft / Tracking
  - Profession-aligned perks (Cook, Forester, Woodworker, Alchemy)
- What is available in Greatwood 1–20 as a **stub** that can expand later

Goal: give players **meaningful choices** that reinforce playstyle without overwhelming them or locking them into MMO-style talent trees yet.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Few choices, big flavor**  
   Early talents should be:
   - Obvious in theme.
   - Noticeable in feel.

2. **Complement, not replace stats & gear**  
   Talents modify:
   - How you use weapons and skills.
   - How your tracking, camp, and profession loops feel.

3. **No hard-lock dead ends**  
   Decisions matter but:
   - Can be lightly respec’d at Lodge if needed.
   - Are not permanent build traps at 1–20.

4. **Diegetic framing**  
   Talents are framed as:
   - Hunter techniques.
   - Lessons learned from Lodge mentors and field experience.

## Structure Overview

### Talent Tracks (Greatwood 1–20 Stub)

Four broad tracks:

1. **Path of the Bow** (Ranged focus)
2. **Path of the Blade & Axe** (Melee focus)
3. **Path of the Trail** (Tracking & Fieldcraft)
4. **Path of the Lodge** (Professions & Support)

Each track:

- Has:
  - 3–5 early perks.
- Unlocks:
  - Start around level 3–5.
  - Gain 1 talent point every few levels (e.g., at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18).

Players can:

- Mix and match between tracks, but:
  - Bonuses synergize more if you lean into one or two paths.

## Talent Point Flow

- Example distribution:

  - Level 3: 1 talent point  
  - Level 6: +1  
  - Level 9: +1  
  - Level 12: +1  
  - Level 15: +1  
  - Level 18: +1  

- Total by 20:
  - ~6 points (tunable).
- Expectation:
  - Players specialize in 1–2 paths but can dabble in others.

---

## Respec Rules (Early)

- At the Lodge:
  - Player can speak to a mentor/trainer NPC.
  - Pay a modest cost (coin or rare ingredient) to reset talent points.
- Philosophy:
  - Try builds, don’t stress.
  - Still feel meaningful (not free respec every 5 seconds).

---

## Integration With Other Systems

- **Combat Stats & Feel (71):**
  - Talents mostly tweak:
    - Stamina economy.
    - Crit/weak-point behavior.
    - Quality-of-life aspects of combat.

- **Weapons & Gear (72, 73, 74, 75):**
  - Talents enhance but don’t invalidate:
    - Bow vs melee vs mixed loadouts.
    - Light vs medium armor choices.
    - Shield vs no-shield choices.

- **Tracking, Camps, Weather (67, 77, 81):**
  - Path of the Trail and Lodge:
    - Make fieldcraft loops richer without needing totally separate skill trees.

- **Professions & Rep (54, 59):**
  - Path of the Lodge:
    - Slightly reinforces profession-focused play without making non-crafters feel gimped.

- **Game Bible / Codex (69):**
  - Talents can be framed in lore as:
    - Named techniques.
    - Lodge “schools” of hunting thought.

---

## Next Actions

- Define a **first-pass talent list**:
  - 3–5 perks per path actually implementable for 1–20.
- Cross-check:
  - With recipes, gear, and hunts so talents actually hit gameplay loops.
- Design:
  - 2–3 short Lodge mentor quests that:
    - Introduce the idea of paths.
    - Let players “earn” their first talent choice in an in-world way.
