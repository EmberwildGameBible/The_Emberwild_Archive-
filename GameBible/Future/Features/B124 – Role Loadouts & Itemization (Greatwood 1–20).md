# B124 – Role Loadouts & Itemization (Greatwood 1–20)
1. Purpose

Define practical gear and itemization paths for the five core roles (B110) through the Greatwood 1–20 arc, so that:

Each role has a clear, flavorful progression:

Starter → Early → Mid → Capstone-in-Greatwood.

Signature Hunts (B117–B121), contract packs (B115–B116), and professions (B108, 58) feed directly into:

Weapons.

Armor pieces.

Trinkets.

Brews and consumables.

This doc is a crosswalk between:

Roles/archetypes (B110)

Status & damage tags (B109)

Loot & gear families (B107)

Hunts / contracts (B115–B123)

It does not fully restate item stats (that’s B107), but specifies who uses what, when, and how it’s acquired.

3. Level Bands & Gear “Tiers”

For Greatwood, we chunk itemization into four tiers:

Tier 1 (Levels 1–5) – Scraps & Lodge Issue

Tier 2 (Levels 6–10) – Greatwood-Break-In

Tier 3 (Levels 11–15) – Specialist Gear

Tier 4 (Levels 16–20) – Signature Linked Sets

Each tier:

Has generic drops and crafts.

And role-flavored lines tied to contracts & Hunts.

4. Tier 1 (Levels 1–5) – Scraps & Lodge Issue
4.1 Weapons

All roles start with simple Lodge-issued gear; early upgrades come from:

Tutorial Hunts (T1–T3).

Basic profession crafts.

Early contracts (H1, S1–S3).

Examples:

Ridgewood Longknife (generic starter melee):

Slightly better damage than absolute basic.

Unlocked via T1 (“First Blood on the Ridge”).

Old Lodge Bow:

Reward from early Huntmaster-friendly contracts (H1, H2).

Works for Striker / Woodsman.

Warden’s Training Shield:

Early Warden reward via escort/protect contracts (E1).

High block, low damage, no special tags.

Scribe’s Strapcase:

Scholar-flavored offhand with:

Small resource regen.

Minor bonus to observation/Field Scribe actions.

Reward from T3 (“Quiet Eyes, Quiet Hands”).

4.2 Armor

Simple armor lines:

Lodge Leathers:

Default set for most.

Balanced resistances, no strong identity.

Warden Drillplate:

Slightly heavier chest piece for Wardens.

Small bonus to guard/block.

Scribe’s Wrap:

Light robe-like top.

4.3 Consumables

Early brews:

Simple:

Healing draught.

Stamina tonic.

One or two entry-level anti-POISON or anti-BLEED tonics from Isha if you help Infirmary (S1).

Roles differentiate mostly on how they use this shared pool rather than unique items at this tier.

5. Tier 2 (Levels 6–10) – Greatwood-Break-In

Tier 2 is where roles first diverge visibly and pockets start to matter (Ragged Verge, Hollowroot Fringe, Black Sap Grove edges, Ember Run).

Rewarded via early Grove research & support.

Warren Antitoxins:

Coming from Hollowroot Fringe contracts.

All roles still share basic heals, but “signature” brews start showing up in loot tables for their preferred content.

7. Tier 4 (Levels 16–20) – Signature-Linked Sets

Tier 4 gear is explicitly tied to big Hunts and decisions (B117–B121, B120 branches, B121 branches).

7.1 Black-Sap Devourer Line (B117)

Core Idea: High power with corruption interplay.

Devourer Fang Weapon Family:

Path:

Early Sap-Touched weapons → Devourer components added.

Roles:

Striker:

“Devourer Fangblade” – big crits vs corrupted enemies.

Corruption-Edge:

“Devourer Channelblade/Bow” – heavy TAG_CORRUPTION scaling, strong risk.

Devourer Husk Armor Line:

Heavy variant:

Warden: strong vs Corruption, huge physical durability, but heavier HCL consequences if badly hurt.

Medium variant:

Woodsman: small corruption resist, better mobility.

Light variant:

Scholar: improved resistance to Corruption status & better casting in corrupted zones.

Set effect examples:

2-piece:

Minor Corruption resistance.

4-piece:

Unique interaction in Devourer arena (if re-fought) or similar pockets.

7.2 Hollowroot Matron Line (B118)

Core Idea: Brood, TOXIC, swarm management.

Matron Pierce / Broodcutter (weapons):

Striker:

High damage vs clustered enemies.

Warden:

Polearm variant with reach, good for crowd control.

Scholar:

Staff/implement improving AoE slows/roots vs lesser enemies.

Broodwarden Armor:

Strong TOXIC resistance.

Bonuses vs brood-type enemies.

Optional:

If eggs spared:

Slightly different visual and minor Mercy-associated flavor.

Woodsman:

Hybrid weapons that support ranged/melee interplay.

Howler Hide Armor:

Medium sets:

Fear/SUPPRESSED resistance.

Kill Path – Crown in Hand

King’s Crown Weapons:

Striker:

High-crit, high reward.

7.5 Shadow Under the Wardstone Line (B121)

Again, branch-dependent.

Rebind Path – Shadow-Binder Gear

Shadow-Bound Warden Implements:

Shields / foci that:

Interact with wards more dynamically.

Effects:

Occasional “Echo Pulse” damage/mitigation.

Binder’s Robes / Armor:

Hybrid Warden/Scholar sets:
