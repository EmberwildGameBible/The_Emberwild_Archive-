# 94 – Greatwood Festivals & Lodge Rituals

## Purpose

Define the **festivals, holy days, and repeating rituals** that shape life around Greatwood Lodge:

- What the **Lodge calendar** looks like (in Greatwood 1–20).
- The **major festivals**: what changes in the world, what you can do, what you can earn.
- The **small rituals** that happen regularly:
  - Ember Pot evenings
  - Memorials
  - First Hunts
- How all of this ties into:
  - Hunts & Deeds (61)
  - Dynamic events & secrets (62, 90)
  - Region layout & POIs (63)
  - Social & rep (59, 64)
  - Ember Pot & professions (52–57, 60, 85)
  - Trophy Hall & Quarters (86, B100)
  - Wounds & fallen hunters (B101)

This is the “**when**” layer of Greatwood: not just where and what, but what the forest and Lodge are doing **today**.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Festivals punctuate arcs**

   - They mark:
     - Ends of Deeds
     - Seasonal transitions
     - Story milestones.
   - They’re not random parties; they’re the way the Lodge **remembers**.

2. **Rituals bind systems together**

   - Every festival/ritual is an excuse to:
     - Use the Ember Pot
     - Visit the Trophy Hall
     - Change speech, Hunts, and camp behavior.

3. **Cozy + uneasy**

   - Greatwood should feel:
     - Warm and communal at the fire.
     - Slightly haunted in the dark.
   - Festivals and rituals play both:
     - Comfort (stew, songs, stories)
     - Tension (Ash-Edge, Hollowroot whispers).

4. **Low friction to participate**

   - You should be able to:
     - Drop into a festival, do a few things, and leave.
   - Festival content:
     - Adds flavor and side rewards.
     - Doesn’t hold the entire mainline hostage.

5. **Reusable calendar**

   - 94 should be:
     - A template for how Lodges structure time in other regions.
     - Only the names/themes change.

---

## 1. The Greatwood Lodge Year (Abstracted)

For design, we treat the Lodge year as four broad “seasons”:

1. **Thawturn** – snow/ice retreat, paths open.
2. **Greenglow** – forest in full leaf; hunts abundant.
3. **Emberfall** – leaves turn, nights lengthen, ash winds pick up.
4. **Deepember** – cold, quiet, fires central.

Greatwood 1–20 doesn’t need a real calendar system; **festival triggers** can be driven by:

- Story milestones
- A minimum in-world time since last festival
- Region state (e.g. Ash-Edge stabilized)

But the fiction is that these events repeat annually.

---

## 2. Major Festivals (Greatwood 1–20)

We define three main festivals for the Greatwood early game:

1. **Emberwake** – founding + fire festival (Ember Pot & Lodge identity).
2. **First Cut** – tools, wood, and the Broken Tools arc.
3. **Ash-Edge Vigil** – mourning the fires, watching the burn-scar.

Later regions can add more, but these three give the “triangle” of food, craft, and fire-scar.

---

## 3. Emberwake – Festival of the First Fire

### 3.1 Theme & Mood

- **When:** Late Thawturn / early Greenglow; or after a major Lodge milestone (e.g. first Deed completed).
- **Mood:**
  - Warm, loud, crowded.
  - “This is why we have a Lodge at all.”

## 9. Technical / Data Model

### 9.1 Festival States

Per festival:

- `festival_id` – `FST-GW-EMBERWAKE`, `FST-GW-FIRSTCUT`, `FST-GW-ASHVIGIL`
- `name`
- `theme_tags[]` – `fire`, `tools`, `ash`, `memory`
- `activation_conditions[]`:
  - Story flags
  - Time passed
  - Deed completion
- `duration`:
  - In-world hours/days (abstract).
- `phases[]`:
  - `setup`, `active`, `late`, `cleanup`
- `world_changes[]`:
  - Decor toggles
  - Hunt & event weighting changes
  - Ember Pot recipes active

### 9.2 Hooks

Festival system exposes:

- `OnFestivalPhaseChanged(festival_id, phase)`
  - UI: show notifications.
  - Systems:
    - Rebake boards, events, Ember Pot state, Hall lights.

Festival-aware content registers:

- “I care about Emberwake active-phase” etc.

---

## 10. Next Actions

1. **Lock fiction beats** for:
   - Emberwake
   - First Cut
   - Ash-Edge Vigil
2. **Define activation timing**:
   - Story flags + soft time windows.
3. **Author core scenes & barks**:
   - Ember Pot speeches
   - Hall quiet hour lines
   - Forester/Carpenter demonstrations.
4. **Wire festival flags to systems**:
   - Hunt Board weighting
   - Dynamic events
   - Ember Pot recipes
   - Trophy Hall lighting.
5. **Decide re-run behavior**:
   - Can these festivals recur in Greatwood “endgame” loop?
   - Or are they one-time per character for 1–20, with future regions handling later cycles?

94 should be treated as the **heartbeat layer**: the predictable but meaningful beats that make Greatwood feel like a place that has a past, a calendar, and people trying to celebrate and remember things even while the forest keeps changing around them.
