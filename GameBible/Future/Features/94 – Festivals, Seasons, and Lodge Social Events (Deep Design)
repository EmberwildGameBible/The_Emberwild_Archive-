# 94 – Festivals, Seasons, and Lodge Social Events (Deep Design)

## Purpose

Deepen the design of **Lodge social life**:

- Festivals, feasts, and ritual days (64, 85, 86)
- Smaller recurring social events and competitions
- How “seasons” (narrative/structural, not necessarily full dynamic seasons) affect:
  - Hunts & Deeds (61, 66)
  - Ember Pot & economy (85, 84)
  - Player progression, cosmetics, and trophies (82, 86)

Goal: make Emberwild feel like a **living community** with traditions and rhythms, not just a static quest hub.

---

## Festivals & Seasonal Rhythm

### Seasonal Structure (Narrative-Level)

For Greatwood 1–20, treat “seasons” as:

- **Narrative/structural beats**, not literal real-time seasons:
  - Early Season:
    - Opening of the Hunt.
  - Mid Season:
    - Peak activity, bigger threats, major Deeds.
  - Late Season:
    - Reflection, heavy corruption hints, Ember Night.

Story arcs and festival events align with these phases, giving a sense of **time passing** within the campaign.

---

## Core Festivals

### 1. Ember Night Feast

**Theme:**

- Celebration of survival, community, and the Ember Pot itself (85).

**Trigger Conditions:**

- Ember Pot meter hits Feast threshold (85).
- Certain story/deed milestones achieved.
- Possibly tied to “Late Season” narrative beat.

**Activities:**

- Massive communal meal.
- NPC scenes:
  - Songs, stories of past hunts.
  - Council members giving short speeches (83).
- Mini-games:
  - Eating contests.
  - Storytelling choices with light gameplay outcomes.

**Mechanical Effects:**

- Strong temporary buff:
  - e.g., for X hours or next Y Hunts:
    - Increased stamina regen.
    - Slight bonus to Lodge rep or coin from Hunts (84).
- Unique vendors:
  - Festival-specific recipes or cosmetic items (cloaks, trophies).
- Trophy Wall update (86):
  - Festival plaques recording key achievements.

---

### 2. Hunt Opening Rite

**Theme:**

- Kickoff of a major hunting period in Greatwood.

---

## Smaller Recurring Social Events

### Lodge Contests

Examples:

- **Archery Trials**:
  - Informal competition at Lodge range.
  - Rewards:
    - Minor tokens.
    - Cosmetics (quiver skins, target knickknacks).

- **Camp Cook-Off**:
  - Cooking minigame:
    - Time/ingredient puzzle.
  - Rewards:
    - Recipe unlocks.

### Informal Gatherings

- Nights where:
  - NPCs gather at fire.
  - Short random interactions can be triggered:
    - Jokes.
    - Ghost stories.
    - Lore hints.

These events:

- Don’t always have big mechanical rewards.
- Serve as “breathing room” and immersion.

## Season-Driven System Changes

Even with a relatively static global climate, we can use “seasons” to:

- Temporarily adjust:

  - Hunt Board offerings.
  - Enemy mix in certain regions.
  - Availability of some ingredients (e.g., certain mushrooms or fish).

### Early Season

- Hunts:
  - More introductory hunts, training Deeds.
- Economy:
  - Ingredient prices stable.
- Atmosphere:
  - Lodge optimistic.
  - Ember Pot not yet a crisis.

### Mid Season

- Hunts:
  - More complex Deeds, first world boss options.
- Economy:
  - Some resources become scarcer, others more abundant.
- Atmosphere:
  - Lodge busy, minor frictions surface (83).

### Late Season

- Hunts:
  - High-stakes Deeds, major bosses.
  - Corruption-related Deeds increase (91).
- Economy:
  - Shortages possible; Ember Pot pressure rises (85).
- Atmosphere:
  - Mood more serious.
  - Festivals like Ember Night provide catharsis.

---

## Player Agency & Participation

- Player chooses:
  - How much they engage festivals and events.
- Rewards scale with participation:
  - Casual engagement:
    - Light buffs, flavor.
  - Deep engagement:
    - Unique cosmetics and recipes.
    - More Lodge rep (59).
    - Stronger sense of belonging.

No one festival is mandatory for main story progression, but:

- Ignoring Lodge life entirely:
  - Means missing:
    - Some talents, recipes, and narrative context.
