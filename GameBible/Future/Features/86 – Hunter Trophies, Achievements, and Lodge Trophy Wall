# 86 – Hunter Trophies, Achievements, and Lodge Trophy Wall

## Purpose

Define the **trophy and achievement layer** for Emberwild:

- How player accomplishments are represented **in-world** (trophies, mounts, plaques)
- How a light achievement system ties into:
  - Hunts & Deeds (61, 66)
  - Dungeons & bosses (65)
  - Professions & Lodge contributions (52–59, 85)
- How the **Lodge Trophy Wall / Hall of Deeds** evolves over time.

Goal: make progression feel visible and tangible, especially **inside the Lodge**.

---

## Core Concepts

1. **Physical trophies in the Lodge**
   - Antlers, tusks, plaques, beast heads, carved reliefs.

2. **Personal achievement log**
   - A UI/log showing:
     - Major hunts completed.
     - Notable firsts.
     - Milestone counters.

3. **Shared vs personal recognition**
   - Some trophies:
     - Represent the Lodge’s collective achievements.
   - Some small items:
     - Belong to the player’s personal space (future rooms/housing).
