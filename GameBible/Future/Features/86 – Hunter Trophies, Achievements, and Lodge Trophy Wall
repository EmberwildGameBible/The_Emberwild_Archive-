# 86 – Lodge Trophy Hall & Shared Trophy Display System

## Purpose

Define the **Greatwood Lodge Trophy Hall** as:

- The **public face** of Hunts, Deeds, and major feats  
- A **shared display system** for player trophies and Lodge narrative milestones  
- A **social prestige layer** that connects:
  - Greatwood Hunts & Deeds (61–62)
  - Broken Tools & Professions (52–57, 60)
  - Dynamic Events & Region Moments (62–63)
  - Personal Quarters (B100)

This file answers:

- What is the Trophy Hall physically?
- How do **player trophies** relate to **Lodge trophies**?
- How is prestige displayed without turning the Hall into chaos?
- How can the system scale to future Lodges and regions?

---

## Design Goals

1. **Lodge Wall = World Canon**

   - The Trophy Hall shows:
     - “What the Lodge recognizes as fact.”
   - It feels like:
     - A living museum.
     - An evolving record of who did what.

2. **Your room is yours, the Hall is the story of all**

   - B100: Purely personal curation.
   - 86: Public, curated representation of:
     - Player
     - Other hunters
     - The Lodge itself.

3. **Readable, not cluttered**

   - At a glance:
     - Key legendary beasts
     - Major crises
     - Famous Hunts/Deeds
   - No wall of spammy micro-achievements.

4. **Social prestige without hard gating content**

   - The Hall is about:
     - Recognition
     - Flavor
   - Not about:
     - Locking power behind “Hall slots”.

5. **Template for other regions**

   - Same structure reused for:
     - Other Lodges
     - City halls
     - Faction galleries

## 1. Physical Concept: Trophy Hall Layout

### 1.1 Location in Greatwood Lodge

- The Trophy Hall is:

  - A **long, high-ceilinged room** branching off the main Lodge hall.
  - Accessible:
    - From the central hearth area
    - Via short corridor lined with older, faded trophies.

- Atmosphere:

  - Warm lantern light.
  - Wood, stone, banners.
  - Occasional dust motes, smell of oils and old hides.

### 1.2 Room Zones

The hall is divided into **zones**:

1. **Founders’ Wall**
   - Oldest, fixed trophies.
   - NPC-only / Lodge history.
   - Player cannot alter these.

2. **Great Hunts Gallery**
   - Large, high-impact trophies from big Deeds / world bosses.
   - Limited, curated slots.

3. **Campaign Corners**
   - Smaller clusters for:
     - Specific arcs:
       - Broken Tools
       - Ash-Edge fires
       - Hollowroot border incidents.

4. **Recognition Row**
   - Rotating plaques / small trophies referencing:
     - Player achievements
     - Other hunters
     - Seasonal/festival feats.

5. **Central Plinth / Feature Display**
   - 1–2 prominent pedestals in the center for:
     - Current featured trophy
     - Current seasonal or campaign highlight.

6. **Visitor Panel / Ledger**
   - Data display:
     - Names
     - Dates
     - Short descriptions tied to trophies.

---

## 2. Trophy Types for the Hall

Not every trophy that can go in B100 belongs here. Hall trophies are a **curated subset**.

### 2.1 Hall Trophy Categories

1. **Legendary Hunts**
   - Deeds, world bosses, region-defining beasts.
   - Examples:
     - The Boar That Wouldn’t Die
     - Ash-Burrowed Alpha
     - Hollowroot whisper entities.

2. **Major Crises & Campaigns**
   - Fire events, siege defenses, corruption thresholds.
   - Examples:
     - First Break of Ash-Edge fires
     - Broken Tools resolution (symbolic tool displays).

3. **Historic Tools & Artifacts**
   - Attuned tools that changed Lodge practice.
   - Example:
     - Original “Firstgrain” axe prototype.

4. **Seasonal & Festival Trophies**
   - Festival champions.
   - Seasonal hunts and contests.

5. **Personal Recognition Items**
   - Small plaques or markers representing:
     - Individual player contributions
     - Named hunters (PCs/NPCs).

### 2.2 Hall vs Personal Trophy Rules

- **Hall Trophies:**
  - Limited number per category.
  - Represent “canonical” Lodge milestones.
  - Often come in **shared form** (many players can claim the same underlying feat but see “their angle” in UI).

- **Personal Trophies (B100):**
  - Larger inventory.
  - More granular achievements.
  - Full control per player.

---

## 3. Progression & Unlock Logic

### 3.1 Hall State Phases

The Trophy Hall evolves in **phases**:

1. **Phase 0 – Bare Bones**
   - At game start / player Lodge membership:
     - Founders’ Wall populated.
     - A few old great-hunt trophies.
   - Great Hunts Gallery mostly empty.

2. **Phase 1 – Greatwood Stabilization**
   - As collective progress is made in Greatwood:
     - Specific Greatwood Deeds resolved.
     - Broken Tools questline completed (by world-narrative standard).
   - Campaign Corners begin to fill.

3. **Phase 2 – Corruption Tensions**
   - Hollowroot border content engaged.
   - Ash-Edge events escalate and resolved.
   - New trophies added, some old trophies gain new plaques or commentary.

4. **Phase 3 – Mature Lodge**
   - All core Greatwood arcs finished.
   - Trophy Hall filled with:
     - Visual story of forest stabilization / continuing watch.

### 3.2 Player-Specific Recognition

Within the shared Hall:

- Player sees:

  - **Global / Lodge-wide pieces** (same for everyone).
  - **Player-specific overlays**:
    - Plaques with their name.
    - Small badges indicating:
      - Which trophies they personally helped unlock.

Examples:

- Under the Boar Skull:

  - Base plaque: “The Boar That Wouldn’t Die – Finally Felled in the Year of Ember X.”
  - Player overlay (if they completed D-GW-001):
    - “You took part in this Hunt.”

- A wall of small tokens:

  - Each representing players who completed all Greatwood Deeds.
  - Player can find “their” token glowing or highlighted.

- During Hollowroot arc:
  - Root charm or corruption sample encased.

Player can:

- Inspect to get a **summary of current chapter** of Lodge story.

---

## 5. Player Interaction & UI

### 5.1 Basic Interactions

Player can:

- Walk up to a trophy → **Inspect**:
  - See:
    - Trophies’ name
    - Short description (2–3 lines)
    - Source content (Hunt/Deed/Quest)
    - Personal involvement (“You did this.” / “You have not faced this yet.”)

- Use a **Hall Ledger / Panel**:
  - Filter trophies by:
    - Category (Hunts, Deeds, Professions, Festivals)
    - Campaign (Broken Tools, Hollowroot, etc.)

### 5.2 Player Overlay Logic

The world needs to feel consistent **and** reflect player accomplishments.

Approach:

- Physical trophy **always present** once canonical event is “done” in world.
- Player-specific overlay:

  - Shows one of:
    - “You personally were involved.”
    - “Hunters of your Lodge handled this before your arrival.”
    - “This threat remains unresolved in your history.”

- For multi-path choices (e.g. D-GW-005 – A Debt in Blood):

  - A shared base plaque:
    - Neutral description of event.
  - Player overlay:
    - Records which outcome they chose.

### 5.3 Linking to Personal Quarters (B100)

In the Hall:

- When inspecting a trophy that has a **personal variant**:

  - UI button: “View your copy in quarters.” (if owned)
    - Teleports to B100 or opens a mini preview.
  - If not owned:
    - “Earn a personal copy by completing [Quest/Deed].”

Example:

- Inspect Boar Skull in Hall:
  - “You can display a personal crest in your quarters.”

## 6. System Hooks & Integration

### 6.1 With Hunts & Deeds (61–62)

- Completion of specific Deeds:

  - Unlocks corresponding Hall trophy if not already present.
  - Triggers Lodge social barks:
    - Hunters pointing you toward the Hall.

- Some Hunts:

  - Update plaques or add **small marks** (e.g. tally marks under a beast head).

### 6.2 With Broken Tools & Attunement (60)

- Broken Tools questline:

  - Initially: Hall shows messy “Broken Tools Shelf”.
  - After completion:
    - Shelf cleaned, Attuned Tools Display installed.
    - Plaques updated to reflect new standards.

- Profession ranks:

  - Determine whether Fen, Arlen, Mara mention “go look at the display”.

### 6.3 With Dynamic Events (62)

- Certain dynamic events can:

  - Add scribbled notes or minor tokens to the Hall.
  - Example:
    - Repeated involvement in “Lost Gatherer” events adds a small tally mark or text line on a recognition board.

### 6.4 With Region Layout (63)

- Some Hall plaques reference:

  - Specific POIs:
    - Ash-Edge Stand
    - Whispershade Glade
  - Player can:
    - Click “View on map” from the Hall UI, setting a map pin.

### 6.5 With Personal Quarters (B100)

- Completing key Hall milestones:

  - Automatically grant **corresponding personal trophies**:
    - Boar Skull Crest → B100 trophy
    - Attunement Notes → B100 desk item

- Room tier upgrades:

  - Might be mentioned in Hall barks:
    - “They even gave you real quarters after that one.”

## 8. Scaling to Other Regions

The design of 86 is a **template**:

- Other Lodges:

  - Copy structure:
    - Founders’ Wall
    - Great Hunts Gallery
    - Campaign Corners
    - Recognition Row
  - Replace trophy content with:
    - Region-specific Deeds
    - Region campaigns.

- City Halls / Faction Galleries:

  - Similar modeling:
    - Replace Hunts with political decisions, wars, etc.
  - Keep same data model for easy reuse.

---

## 9. Next Actions

1. **Lock physical layout** of Greatestwood Trophy Hall:
   - Number of walls
   - Zone positions
   - Sightlines from entrance.

2. **Implement initial Hall trophy list**:
   - 5 Deed trophies (Boar, Fire-Beast, Ash-Burrow, Whisper, Debt).
   - 3 Broken-Tools-related displays.
   - 3–5 Founders trophies.

3. **Hook up world-state triggers**:
   - Deed completion → Hall trophy appears if not already present.
   - Broken Tools completion → campaign corner updates.

4. **Add player overlay logic**:
   - Start with:
     - Simple “You did this / You haven’t” messages.
   - Later, expand to:
     - Choice-specific overlays for moral Deeds.

5. **Wire Hall to B100**:
   - Ensure every Hall trophy with a player variant:
     - Points to its personal version.
     - Rewards that version when appropriate.

The Trophy Hall should feel like **walking through the spine of the game’s history**, with your own story threaded into it—but never required to min-max to keep playing.
```
