---

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Recommended Placement

Matron should feel like:

- The **capstone** for early Hollowroot content.
- Unlocked after the player has:
  - Encountered **Hollowroot tendrils / husks** in the wild.
  - Completed at least one early **Hollowroot incursion** event.
  - Spoken with Ward/Scholar NPCs about Hollowroot.

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **“Roots in the Wrong Places”**
   - Contract on Hunt Board:
     - Reports of roots erupting where they shouldn’t:
       - Roadside, under stables, along riverbanks.
   - Player:
     - Clears several **minor Hollowroot nodes**.
     - Collects early `hollowroot_core_chunk` and `hollowroot_resin`.

2. **Hollow Pockets**
   - Second contract:
     - “Find and seal a Hollowroot pocket before it breaches to the surface.”
   - Player:
     - Descends into a small Hollowroot chamber.
     - Fights tendrils and husks.
     - Is forced to retreat when a “larger presence” stirs.

3. **Scholar/Alchemist Interlude**
   - Back at Lodge / Wardstone Hill:
     - NPCs analyze the corruption.
     - Introduce:
       - `hollowroot_tonic_base`
       - Basic Hollowroot brews and stews.
   - They conclude:
     - “These pockets will keep returning unless the Matron is cut out.”

4. **Hunt Posting – “The Matron”**
   - Named Hunt appears on board:
     - “The Hollowroot Matron has rooted itself in a deep pocket. Wardlines will buckle if it isn’t excised.”
   - Objective:
     - Enter a larger Hollowroot den.
     - Push to the deepest chamber.
     - Destroy the Matron heart.

5. **Aftermath**
   - Post-Hunt:
     - Hollowroot incursions reduce in frequency (for a while).
     - Ward NPCs and Cook/Alchemist NPCs unlock:
       - Stronger Hollowroot-based dishes/brews.
       - Expedition projects for further Hollowroot dives.

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Layout

The Matron’s lair is a **multi-room Hollowroot pocket** that culminates in the heart chamber.

- **Entry Tunnel**
  - Narrow, root-lined corridors.
  - Low-level tendrils / husks.
  - Occasional “root spikes” hazards.

- **Outer Chamber**
  - Wide area with:
    - Root columns.
    - Fungus clusters (`glowcap`, other mushrooms).
    - Patches of shallow corruption mire.
  - Mini-events:
    - Tendril waves.
    - “Root choke” constrictor roots.

- **Heart Chamber (Boss Arena)**
  - Large, circular room:
    - Floor of tangled roots and dark mud.
    - Central **Hollowroot Heart** structure:
      - A pulsing root-heart, tethered to walls/ceiling.
    - Pools of **Hollowroot mire**.
    - Hanging sacs of spores and root-buds.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **Clean Root Platforms**
  - Slightly raised root platforms.
  - Lower corruption damage, good for regrouping.

- **Mire Pools**
  - Slow, apply **Hollowroot Mire** stacks:
    - Reduces movement speed.
    - Reduces healing received.
    - Increases corruption tick damage.

- **Fungus Clusters**
  - Interactable for Forager:
    - Can be cleared mid-fight for:
      - Small healing/mana puffs.
      - Or risk releasing spore clouds.

---

## 4. Boss: Hollowroot Matron – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Corrupted Root Monster  
**Fight Length Target:** ~4–7 minutes for a prepared group.

### 4.1 Structure

The “boss” is effectively:

- A central **Matron Heart**.
- Multiple **Hollowroot Tendrils** (limbs).
- Repeatedly summoned **Husks / adds**.

The fight is about:

- Managing adds.
- Keeping the mire from overwhelming the arena.
- Exposing the heart for burst phases.

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 – Root Grasp

**Trigger:** Fight start, Matron at 100% “heart integrity”

Focus: establishing basics.

- **Attacks / Mechanics:**
  - **Root Grasp**
    - Roots erupt in a line or in circles.
    - Minor damage, brief snare.
  - **Spore Vomit**
    - The heart spasms, releasing a slow drifting spore cloud.
    - Standing in it:
      - Reduces vision / screen clarity.
      - Applies light poison/corruption.
  - **Husk Summon**
    - Periodically spawns 2–3 Hollowroot Husks at edge of arena.

- **Mire Growth**
  - Each Root Grasp or Husk death can:
    - Expand nearby mire pools slightly.

- **Goal of Phase 1**
  - Teach players:
    - Avoid eruptions.
    - Kill husks quickly.
    - Stay out of mire whenever possible.

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 – Tangle & Mire

**Trigger:** Matron heart integrity around ~70%.

- The heart **withdraws** behind a root-thicket “shield”.
- Fight switches focus to:
  - Clearing **shield tendrils**.
  - Managing expanding mire.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Tangle Shield**
  - Several large “shield tendrils” around the heart:
    - Must be destroyed to re-expose it.
  - Tendrils use:
    - Heavy slam attacks.
    - Constrictor grabs:
      - Grab a player.
      - Slowly drag them toward mire pools.

- **Mire Surge**
  - Corruption pools:
    - Expand periodically.
    - Threaten to cover entire floor if not managed.

- **Seed Pods**
  - Bulbous pods on the walls/ceiling:
    - Can be targeted and destroyed.
    - If destroyed safely:
      - Stop a mire surge.
    - If ignored:
      - Burst and greatly accelerate pool growth.

- **Goal of Phase 2**
  - Force players to:
    - Make choices: clear pods or focus tendrils?
    - Keep some safe space before phase 3.

---

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Heart Exposed

**Trigger:** All shield tendrils down, heart re-exposed.

- The Matron heart:
  - Drops to lower HP, damage and ability intensity increase.
  - Visual: veins glow bright, pulses stronger.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Heart Pulse**
  - Regular pulsing AoE from heart:
    - Damage scales with how much mire is on the floor.
    - If arena is mostly clean:
      - Manageable.
    - If arena is mostly mire:
      - Very dangerous.

- **Hollowroot Vines**
  - Vines reach out:
    - Try to pull players into mire pools.
  - Can be cut (targetable segments) or resisted via movement.

- **“Last Clutch” Spawn**
  - On hitting threshold HP (~20–25%):
    - Spawns a wave of elite Husks / tendril mini-bosses.
    - Short, intense add phase before final burst on heart.

- **Enrage / Rot Collapse**
  - If fight drags too long:
    - Matron collapses the chamber:
      - Multiple pulses,
      - Maximum mire saturation,
      - “Soft enrage” that ends the fight quickly if not finished.

- **Goal of Phase 3**
  - Provide a satisfying burst-phase:
    - Players use prepared food, brews, and space.

## 5. Specialty Mechanics & Drops

### 5.1 Specialty: Hollowroot Heart Fiber

**Item:** `spec_ingr_hollowroot_heart_fiber` (55)

**Mechanic:**

- Drops from:
  - The heart itself, **but only** if:
    - Players keep at least one **heart-tether tendril** alive until the final burst phase.
    - During the last heart phase, that tether is severed **while** the heart is exposed and pulsing.

Flow:

1. In phase 2 or early phase 3, one tether is marked (visually distinct).
2. If players destroy that tether at the correct timing:
   - Extra chance / guaranteed drop of Heart Fiber.
3. If they destroy all tethers too early:
   - Heart Fiber chance is reduced or lost for that kill.

Design intent:

- Encourage **intentional tether management**, not just mindless AoE.

### 5.2 Specialty: Matron Root Eye

**Item:** `spec_ingr_matron_root_eye` (55)

**Mechanic:**

- Rare drop, tied to:
  - Destroying **all** seed pods before the final heart phase.
  - Or performing a Ward ritual interaction in the arena (e.g. pre-fight or mid-fight action at a small wardstone fragment).

Design:

- Very low chance (8–10%) + conditions.
- Feels like an **“expert clear”** reward.

Used for:

- High-end Hollowroot brews.
- Potent Lodge or ward ritual projects.

### 5.3 Specialty: Hollowroot Mire Sludge

**Item:** `spec_ingr_hollowroot_mire_sludge` (55)

**Sources:**

- Often drops from:
  - Hollowroot Husks (see B151), especially elite versions.
  - Additionally:
    - At the end of Matron fight:
      - Small chance for extra sludge if the arena is **not completely cleaned** (design decision: reward or punish sloppiness).

Uses:

- Risky, potent reagents:
  - Corruption-flavored food/brews (either heavy buffs with side effects, or ward experiments).
  - Could help fuel future ward rituals.

    - Extra Mire Sludge: moderate chance.

- **World Drop Table Access:**
  - Matron uses:
    - Slightly higher `WORLD_UNCOMMON_GW` chance than regular mobs.

---

## 8. Lodge Projects & Expeditions (57)

The Matron is tightly connected to a few key Lodge projects.

### 8.1 Hollowroot Expedition Crate

**Project:** `proj_crate_hollowroot_expedition` (57)

Matron’s role:

- Provides:
  - High volumes of:
    - `hollowroot_core_chunk`
    - `hollowroot_resin`
    - `hollowroot_tonic_base`
  - Specialty reagents that can optionally upgrade crate quality.

Result:

- Expedition crates that:

  - Give powerful **corruption resist** foods and brews in the field.
  - Are basically “Matron-themed” expedition packs.

### 8.2 Hollowroot Expedition Send-Off Feast

You can optionally define/extend a feast project like:

- **Feast:** Hollowroot Expedition Send-Off (tied to 57)
  - Inputs:
    - Matron-sourced cores/resin/fiber.
  - Effects:
    - Powerful corruption-resist buff for upcoming pockets.
    - Slight reduction in Hollowroot event frequency for a duration.

### 8.3 Hollowroot Trophy / Fixture

Potential trophy project:

- **Project:** Hollowroot Heart Shrine

Inputs:

- `spec_ingr_hollowroot_heart_fiber`
- `hollowroot_core_chunk`
- `hollowroot_resin`
- `glowcap`

Outputs:

- A twisted, softly glowing root shrine in Lodge or Ward chamber.
- Passive bonuses:
  - Slight corruption resist when launching Hunts from this Lodge.
  - Minor XP bonus for alchemy or foraging actions involving Hollowroot reagents.

This would live alongside trophy projects defined in 57.

---

## 9. Food & Brew Hooks (52, 53, 58)

### 9.1 Example Food Hooks

From 52 / 53, Matron-sourced ingredients can:

- Enable:
  - `food_hollowroot_protectors_pot` – a strong corruption-resist stew.
  - `food_rootkeeper_ration_bundles` – ration items that mitigate Hollowroot effects.
- Upgrade:
  - Base stews into “infused” versions with safer Hollowroot usage.

Heart Fiber could be the **key** ingredient in:

- A top-tier lodge-only dish:
  - Very strong resist but heavy resource cost and maybe a small debuff.

### 9.2 Brew Hooks

From 58, Matron reagents feed:

- `brew_hollowroot_fortifying_draught`
  - Uses core chunk + tonic base.
  - Bread-and-butter Hollowroot resist brew.

- More advanced brews:
  - `brew_hollowroot_heart_tonic` (using Heart Fiber)
  - `brew_mire_sludge_trial` (using Mire Sludge for risky, powerful effects).

Matron Root Eye:

- Can be the core of:
  - “Insight vs Hollowroot” brews:
    - Reveal hidden pockets,
    - Allow safe interactions with certain corruption objects.

## 12. Implementation Notes (Future You)

In the Bible, B154 tells you:

- What the fight is,
- Which ingredients + specialties it owns,
- What Lodge + Expedition content it feeds.

In data/code, this ties to:

- Creature loot for:
  - `gw_hollowroot_tendril`
  - `gw_hollowroot_husk`
  - `gw_hollowroot_matron`  
  (as already outlined in B151’s loot data design / Lua module draft).
- Ingredient & specialty definitions in 51 / 55.
- Projects in 57 (Expedition Crate / Send-Off / Shrine).
- Food/brews in 52 / 53 / 58.

When you eventually implement Matron:

- Use B154 as the checklist:
  - Arena built? ✔
  - Phases & mechanics exist? ✔
  - Drops & specialties match IDs? ✔
  - Lodge projects and Hollowroot loops actually use the reagents? ✔
