  - B151 (Loot)
  - 51 / 55 (Ingredients & Specialties)
  - 52 / 53 (Cooking)
  - 54 (Tools)
  - 57 (Lodge Projects)
  - 58 (Brews)
  - B153–B159 (Hunts)
  - B160 (Hunts progression map)

This is where you start if you’re asking:
> “What happens in Greatwood 1–20, and why does it all make sense together?”

---

## 1. Region Concept – What is Greatwood?

**Greatwood** is:

- The **first major outdoor region** the player lives in, not just visits.
- A **temperate, slightly haunted forest frontier** where:
  - Villages and Lodges cling to clearings,
  - Wardstones keep a fragile peace,
  - The forest itself feels ancient and opinionated.

Core tone:

- Low fantasy, grounded, Classic-WoW-ish pacing:
  - Fewer, more meaningful drops.
  - Hunts feel like events, not routine chores.
- “Old forest” energy:
  - Everything has a prior history:
    - Hunts,
    - Wardstone rituals,
    - Old expeditions,
    - Abandoned camps.

Core fantasy pillars:

1. **Hunting & Stewardship**
   - You’re not just killing monsters:
     - You’re managing populations,
     - Respecting or ignoring “forest elders” (Stag, Bear, Howler, etc.).
2. **Wards & Corruption**
   - Wardstone Hill is the anchor.
   - Hollowroot pockets and Black Sap glades push back.
   - Weird things happen when ward maintenance fails.
3. **Food, Lodge, and Community**
   - You’re cooking what you hunt.
   - Lodge is a social hub, a progression hub, and a narrative hub.
4. **Old Scars**
   - Ash patches, barrows, and bones (Ragged King).
   - The forest remembers what was done to it.
5. **Shadows Underneath**
   - Shadow Under the Wardstone makes clear:
     - Even the *tools* used to keep the forest safe can go wrong.

## 4. Content Pillars – What the Player Actually Does

### 4.1 Hunts (B153–B159, B160)

- 7 Major Hunts define:
  - High points of combat,
  - Key narrative beats,
  - Owners of specialty reagents and Lodge projects.
- Hunts integrate:

  - Loot (B151),
  - Ingredients (51/55),
  - Food (52/53),
  - Tools (54),
  - Brews (58),
  - Lodge Projects (57).

### 4.2 Contracts & Minor Hunts

- Repeatable or smaller content vs:

  - Wolves, boars, basic Hollowroot growths, minor corruption, bandits (later).
- Feed:

  - Basic ingredient inflow (51),
  - Some coins,
  - Incremental rep and Lodge project progress.

Contracts are the **day-to-day loop**:

- Hunts are the **big moments**.

### 4.3 Dungeons, Pockets & Events

Examples:

- Hollowroot pockets:
  - Mini-dungeons tied to Matron.
- Black Sap outflow events:
  - Previews of Devourer.
- Shadow anomalies near Wardstone:
  - Previews of Shadow Under the Wardstone.
- Barrow delves:
  - Previews of Ragged King.

These give:

- Extra “chapters” between Hunts.
- Situations where:

  - Food and brews matter,
  - Group coordination matters.

### 4.4 Professions

Core professions here:

- **Hunter**:
  - Direct owner of Hunts and contracts.
- **Cook**:
  - Converts ingredients into survival and performance.
- **Alchemist**:
  - Brews tonics, salves, warbrews, ward brews.
- **Forager/Woodworker**:
  - Gathers plants, mushrooms, wood,
  - Crafts trophies, totems, Lodge fixtures.

Greatwood is the **tutorial but not baby tier** for all four:

- You get full loops, just not extreme complexity yet.

---

## 5. System Cross-Links (Hunts ↔ Lodge ↔ Region State)

This is the “why this region feels alive” section.

### 5.1 Hunts Impacting Region

Example patterns:

- Killing **Elder Hollow Stag**:
  - Slightly lowers deer population for a while.
  - Some contracts adjust:
    - More wolves (less prey),
    - Or more nervous villagers.

- Killing **Greatwood Howler**:
  - Wolf ambushes decrease.
  - Some predators redistribute into other subzones.

- Killing **Hollowroot Matron**:
  - Hollowroot pocket frequency drops.
  - Anti-corruption tasks become easier for a while.

- Killing **Black-Sap Devourer**:
  - Black Sap glades retreat a bit.
  - Some wardline pressure is relieved.

- Killing **Ragged King**:
  - Bonepiles stop “walking”.
  - Ash events quiet down.

- Killing **Shadow Under the Wardstone**:
  - Wardstone Hill anomalies normalize.
  - Warden NPCs stop freaking out (for now).

You don’t need to simulate all this in code day one, but this is what **NPC dialogue, contracts, and event weights** should roughly align to.

### 5.2 Lodge Projects & Rituals Feeding Back into Region

Examples from 57:

- **Guardian Totem (Ward-Bear)**:
  - Slightly boosts knockback resist for Hunts launched from this Lodge.

- **Hollowroot Expedition Crate & Send-Off**:
  - Makes Hollowroot pockets safer/easier to farm.

- **Black-Sap Plaques / Handling Gear**:
  - Makes Black-Sap handling less punishing.

- **Ragged King Bone Throne & Ash Pyre**:
  - Tiny boosts to Hunt rep and ash/bone drops.

- **Shadow-Ward Focus / Renewal Rites**:
  - Reduce ward anomalies and related events.

It should feel like:

> “We cleared a nightmare and brought back a piece of it to the Lodge. Now the Lodge is better equipped, and the forest reacts.”

## 6. Golden Path – Example Player Journey 1–20

This is an **example**, not a fixed script. It’s mainly for designers and writers to have a shared mental picture.

1. **1–5 – First Steps**
   - New player arrives at starting village / clearing.
   - Learns:
     - Basic combat vs small wolves, boars.
     - Crafting simple food.
   - Visits Lodge for the first time, sees empty trophy hall.

2. **5–10 – Lodge Hunter**
   - Starts doing:
     - Contracts for wolves, deer, critters.
   - Meets:
     - Hunter NPCs talking about Elder Stag, Howler.
     - Cook showing interest in better meat.
   - Visits Wardstone Hill once; sees wards but doesn’t understand yet.

3. **10–14 – First Major Hunts**
   - Unlocks:
     - **Elder Hollow Stag** and/or **Greatwood Howler**.
   - Completes one:
     - Trophy appears in the Lodge,
     - New food and brews unlock.
   - Region changes a bit:
     - Fewer stags / less howling at night.

4. **14–16 – Wards & Corruption**
   - Ward anomalies start happening:
     - Ward-Bear rumored near Wardstone Hill.
   - Hollowroot pockets appear in small ways:
     - Event chains.
   - Unlocks:
     - **Ward-Bear** Hunt,
     - **Hollowroot Matron** Hunt.
   - Lodge begins:
     - Guardian Totem project,
     - Hollowroot Expedition crates.

5. **16–18 – Corruption & Old Scars**
   - Black Sap glades start creeping into the forest:
     - Minor mobs, events.
   - Ash barrows feel more active:
     - Bonepiles moving, weird rattles.
   - Unlocks:
     - **Black-Sap Devourer**,
     - **Ragged King**.
   - Lodge:
     - Gains Black-Sap fixtures,
     - Starts building bone throne / ash pyre.

6. **18–20 – Shadow Under the Hill**
   - Wardstone Hill anomalies spike:
     - Flickering wardlight,
     - NPC panic.
   - Unlocks:
     - **Shadow Under the Wardstone** Hunt.
   - Player descends, cleans the sub-chamber.
   - After victory:
     - Ward rituals stabilize,
     - Greatwood 1–20 is considered “region complete”.

At this point, the player has:

- Seen all major Hunts.
- Unlocked most Greatwood Lodge projects.
- Acquired a set of recipes, brews, reagents.
- Emotionally “finished” Greatwood and is ready for the next region.

## 7. Implementation Checklist

When you build or review Greatwood 1–20, use this as a checklist:

1. **Subzones:**
   - Starting clearing / village,
   - Lodge & Lodge grounds,
   - Wardstone Hill & approaches,
   - Deep forest glades (Stag),
   - Ridge/pack territory (Howler),
   - Hollowroot pockets (Matron),
   - Black-Sap glades (Devourer),
   - Barrow/ash zone (Ragged King),
   - Wardstone underchamber (Shadow).

2. **Core loops in place:**
   - Contracts and minor Hunts feed basic loot (B151).
   - Hunts B153–B159 exist and are reachable.
   - Professions (Hunter/Cook/Alchemist/Forager) all have viable loops.

3. **Systems connected:**
   - Ingredients from Hunts exist in 51 and tie into 52/53/58.
   - Specialties exist in 55 and tie into 57 projects and/or advanced recipes.
   - Loot tables in B151 for all major creatures align with integration docs.

4. **Narrative continuity:**
   - NPCs mention Hunts appropriately.
   - Region state changes (even if just in dialogue & small event weight shifts) when major Hunts are cleared.
   - Wardstone Hill story starts mild and escalates to Shadow Under the Wardstone.

5. **Lodge feels like a “trophy of your run”:**
   - Major Hunts visibly change the Lodge:
     - Trophies, banners, braziers, thrones, shrines, expeditions, etc.

## 8. How to Use This File Going Forward

Whenever you’re:

- Adding **a new Hunt**:
  - Ask: does it fit Greatwood thematically?
  - If yes:
    - Add it here in the roster and loops.
    - Create a B15x integration doc for it.
    - Wire it into 51/55/57/58/B151.

- Adding **a new project, recipe, or brew**:
  - Ask: which Hunt or subzone does this belong to?
  - Map it into the loop here so it doesn’t float.

- Planning **next regions**:
  - Use Greatwood as the “baseline”:
    - Pacing,
    - Number of Hunts,
    - Depth of integration.

This file (B161) + B160 (Hunts map) + B151 (Loot spine) = the mental atlas for early Emberwild.
