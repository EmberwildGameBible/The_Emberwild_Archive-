# 60 – Profession Questline: The Broken Tools of Greatwood

## Purpose

Define a **multi-quest, profession-driven storyline** that explains why Lodge tools are failing in Greatwood, ties together early-profession gameplay (Forester, Cook, Woodworker), and introduces the idea of **material attunement** and **subtle corruption** in Emberwild’s resources.

This questline is:

- The **first major arc** for profession players in Greatwood.
- The **bridge** between:
  - Early profession leveling (Files 52–57)
  - Lodge Reputation Tracks (File 59)
  - Early Alchemy and corruption hints (File 58, Hollowroot and Deeds in 61–62)
- The narrative justification for:
  - Upgrading from **crude tools** to **attuned Lodge-grade tools**.
  - Why some materials “fight back” when used incorrectly.

---

## High-Level Structure

- **Quest Count:** 5 main quests (+ optional side tasks)
- **Recommended Level:** Character 5–15, Profession rank 3–10
- **Professions Involved:**
  - Forester
  - Cook
  - Woodworker
  - (Optional/preview) Alchemist

### Quest List

1. **Splinters and Cracks** – The problem surfaces.
2. **Bad Batch or Bad Forest** – Materials are tested and suspicion turns outward.
3. **The Grain Remembers** – Fieldwork in Greatwood reveals “resisting” resources.
4. **Hands That Listen, Tools That Answer** – Discovering attunement and fixing the pattern.
5. **The Weight of a Name** – Ceremony, consequences, and crafting attuned tools.

Each quest is designed to:

- Teach **one clear concept** about professions or resources.
- Advance a **shared mystery** about Greatwood’s wood, stone, and ore.
- Reward a mix of:
  - Profession XP and Lodge reputation (File 59)
  - Unique components for tools
  - Cosmetic or narrative unlocks in the Lodge

---

## Core Themes

1. **It is not just “bad RNG” or “cheap goods”**  
   The failures are **systemic** and tied to the forest itself.

2. **Resources have temperament**  
   Wood, ore, and other materials have patterns, memories, and “moods” that can be ignored or respected.

3. **Professions are about relationship, not just extraction**  
   The best Foresters, Cooks, and Woodworkers don’t just take – they **listen** to Greatwood.

4. **Subtle corruption and Hollowroot foreshadowing**  
   Some failures are just human error or misaligned materials.  
   Some are the first ripples of something deeper (Hollowroot, File 61–62).

---

## Key NPCs

These NPCs anchor the questline and are used across multiple quests.

### Forester Arlen Brack

- Role: Senior Forester, practical and blunt.
- Personality:
  - Assumes problems are **human error** before anything mystical.
  - Cares deeply about the woods but refuses to romanticize them.
- Location:
  - Usually in the Lodge yard or at the edge of the tree-cutting staging area.

### Cook Mara Emberpot

- Role: Hearth-cook, runs much of the Ember Pot (File 56).
- Personality:
  - Warm, sharp-tongued, notices everything.
  - Tracks patterns in **failed pots, cracked lids, and ruined batches**.
- Location:
  - Near the Ember Pot and Lodge kitchen.

### Woodworker Fen Tallow

- Role: Master Carpenter, responsible for Lodge repairs and bows/staves.
- Personality:
  - Quiet and meticulous.
  - Talks about wood as if it were people: stubborn, honest, patient, “lying” wood.
- Location:
  - Workshop area, surrounded by warped planks and broken tools.

### Clerk Elira

- Role: Lodge record-keeper and quest giver.
- Personality:
  - Organized, detail-focused, slightly overwhelmed.
- Location:
  - Inside Lodge by the Hunt Board and record shelves.
- Function:
  - Ties the questline into the **Lodge Reputation system** (File 59).
  - Tracks complaints, failures, and “Filed Incidents: Profession, Tools”.

---

## Quest 1 – Splinters and Cracks

### Summary

Tools are failing in ways that make **no sense**: fresh axes snap, pots crack under low heat, finished beams twist overnight. The Lodge cannot keep pretending this is just bad luck.

This quest introduces:

- The problem space.
- The three profession NPCs (Arlen, Mara, Fen).
- The basic loop of:
  - Taking profession-flavored tasks.
  - Returning samples and reports.
  - Earning small amounts of rep with each profession wing.

### Starting Conditions

- Player has completed basic profession onboarding (early steps of Files 52–57).
- Player has at least **one** of the three professions, but the questline is available to all.

### Hook

- Clerk Elira flags the player as “reliable hands” after early profession tasks.
- She asks the player to help investigate a spike in **Filed Breakage Reports**.

### Quest Beats

1. **Report Review**
   - Talk to Clerk Elira.
   - She shows a box of broken tools and incident forms.
   - Simple dialogue choice: which profession’s complaints to look at first.
     - Choice only affects **flavor** of subsequent lines, not eligibility.

2. **Three Voices, One Problem**
   - Visit:
     - Forester Arlen: shows snapped axe-hafts and wedges that won’t hold.
     - Cook Mara: cracked stew-pots, lids splitting, spoons shedding splinters.
     - Fen Tallow: warped beams, bent chisels, glues that refuse to set.
   - Each NPC gives:
     - 1–2 short tasks using basic profession gameplay.
       - Forester: cut a small batch of standard logs.
       - Cook: prepare a simple stew or roast.
       - Woodworker: plane or cut planks from standard stock.
   - **Critical detail:** Tools fail even while the player is performing **simple, well-known recipes** or cuts.

3. **First Round of Samples**
   - Each NPC asks the player to gather **samples**:
     - Wood shavings from snapped hafts.
     - Clay/fragments from cracked pots.
     - Splintered plank fragments.
   - Turn-in to Elira for cataloguing.

### Mechanics & Requirements

- Simple gather/craft/turn-in steps:
  - No high-level profession gating yet.
- Early introduction of:
  - **“Broken Tool Sample”** items used in later quests.
- Environmental storytelling:
  - Broken tools leaning in corners, muttered curses from NPC workers.

### Rewards

- Small amounts of:
  - Forester’s Circle rep
  - Ember Kitchen rep
  - Carpenter’s Hall rep
- Profession XP proportional to tasks done.
- Unlocks **Quest 2 – Bad Batch or Bad Forest**.

---

## Quest 2 – Bad Batch or Bad Forest

### Summary

The Lodge first assumes the problem is **supply-based**: bad ore, rotten wood, poor clay. This quest pushes the player to help test that theory and starts revealing patterns that don’t match a simple “bad batch” explanation.

### Starting NPC

- Clerk Elira, now surrounded by neat stacks of labeled samples.

### Quest Beats

1. **Elira’s Hypothesis: Bad Batch**
   - Elira’s initial conclusion: one or more suppliers sent compromised materials.
   - The player is sent to:
     - Compare Lodge reserves against older, **known-good** stock.
   - Objectives:
     - Fetch bundles of:
       - “Old Lot” wood from storage racks.
       - “Old Lot” clay from sealed jars.
       - “Old Lot” ore from marked crates.
   - Arlen, Mara, Fen each assist with comparisons.

2. **Controlled Trials**
   - The player helps run **controlled tests**:
     - Forester: use old vs new logs with the same axe pattern.
     - Cook: heat old vs new clay pots with equivalent fuel and recipes.
     - Woodworker: shape old vs new planks into identical components.
   - Scripting design:
     - Old lots behave normally.
     - New lots occasionally produce:
       - Splinters at strange angles.
       - Micro-cracks without cause.
       - Knots and grain appearing **where they were not visible before**.

3. **The Forest is “Answering Back”**
   - Fen or Arlen notes that this isn’t consistent with simple rot or poor firing.
   - Dialogue seed:
     - “Wood can be stubborn, but it usually tells you so. This feels…sly.”
   - Mara mentions similar oddities in **food and ingredients** (ties to File 51–56):
     - A stew that separates no matter how it’s stirred.
     - Bread dough that refuses to bind.

4. **Follow the Paper Trail**
   - Player returns to Elira with:
     - Failure rates per batch (simple UI dialogue choices).
   - Elira notices:
     - All problematic lots come from **Greatwood-adjacent sites**, not distant imports.
     - Failures cluster near areas later important to Hunts/Deeds (Files 61–62).

### Mechanics & Requirements

- Higher profession rank slightly improves:
  - Speed of running tests (fewer items required).
- Base difficulty is still accessible at low ranks.

### Rewards

- Moderate Lodge reputation increase, especially with Clerk/Administration.
- Unlocks:
  - **Quest 3 – The Grain Remembers**
  - New optional board-notes on the Hunt Board pointing to specific regions.

---

## Quest 3 – The Grain Remembers

### Summary

The Lodge stops blaming distant suppliers and starts looking at the **places** where resources are gathered. The player is sent into Greatwood to collect fresh samples and observe the forest directly. This is where the questline intersects strongly with Hunts and POIs.

### Starting NPC

- Forester Arlen or Fen Tallow (either can hook the player in based on prior interactions).

### Quest Beats

1. **Marking the Map**
   - Together with Elira and the profession leads, the player marks:
     - 3–5 gathering zones for wood, clay, and ore.
   - These zones should overlap with:
     - Early Hunts (Hunt Board, Files 61–62)
     - Resource-rich POIs from Files 51–55.

2. **Field Study Objectives**
   - For each marked zone:
     - **Observe:** Interact with specific trees, stone faces, or clay beds.
       - The player reads short flavor notes describing:
         - Grain twisting against the cut.
         - Bark “heavier” than it looks.
     - **Harvest:** Gather small amounts of material via profession actions.
     - **Record:** Place simple marks or totems indicating the Lodge is “watching”.
   - Optional tie-ins:
     - If the player has active Hunts in the same area, they can:
       - Turn in both Hunts and profession objectives together.
       - Hear hunters comment on “bad wood” for shafts and hafts.

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - When the player returns:
     - Arlen, Mara, Fen each draw conclusions based on their field notes.
   - Shared observation:
     - Failures are more likely near:
       - Old burn-scars (see D-GW-003 – Tracks in the Ash).
       - Subtle corruption nodes (see CH-GW-012 – Whispers in the Hollow).
   - They disagree on cause:
     - Arlen: “Forest’s pushing back because we’ve forgotten patience.”
     - Fen: “Something in the grain is misaligned, the way a lie misaligns a face.”
     - Mara: “If the ingredients don’t want to be in the pot, the stew always knows.”

4. **First Mention of Attunement**
   - Fen introduces the idea (gently) that:
     - Tools and materials might need to be **deliberately “matched”**.
   - No mechanic yet – just narrative foreshadowing.

### Mechanics & Requirements

- Requires the player to:
  - Travel across multiple Greatwood POIs.
  - Use profession gathering skills in specified locations.
- Integration with 61–62:
  - Some Hunts temporarily improve resource yield or tool stability in those zones.

### Rewards

- Noticeable bump in:
  - Forester’s Circle rep
  - Carpenter’s Hall rep
- Unlocks:
  - Early “Attunement Notes” item in the Archive (small lore entry).
  - **Quest 4 – Hands That Listen, Tools That Answer**.

---

## Quest 4 – Hands That Listen, Tools That Answer

### Summary

The Lodge commits to a new way of working: instead of forcing Greatwood into old patterns, they will learn how to **work with** the forest’s grain, not against it. The player helps prototype new tool designs and techniques, establishing the concept of **attunement** in both story and systems.

### Starting NPC

- Woodworker Fen Tallow, in the workshop surrounded by half-finished prototypes.

### Quest Beats

1. **Prototype Tools**
   - Fen gives the player:
     - Crude prototype versions of:
       - A forester’s axe
       - A cook’s ladle/pot-lid
       - A carpenter’s chisel or plane
   - These prototypes are intentionally unstable in code:
     - Slightly worse stats than current tools.
     - But with **hidden hooks** for attunement behavior.

2. **Listening Exercises**
   - Player is asked to **use these prototypes** on:
     - Different types of wood in Greatwood.
     - Different fuels and pots in the Ember Pot.
     - Different carpentry tasks (beams, bow-staves, supports).
   - Design intent:
     - Certain combinations produce:
       - Little to no failure.
       - Slight bonuses (faster gather, less fatigue).
     - Other combinations still feel “wrong” (visual feedback, minor penalties).

3. **Recording the “Good Matches”**
   - The player records combinations that feel better:
     - “Ash from the riverbend plays well with clay from the northern pit.”
     - “This softwood prefers to be used in curved shapes, not straight beams.”
   - Fen and Mara formalize these into:
     - **Attunement Tables** (referencing ingredient taxonomy in File 51–55).

4. **Naming the Pattern**
   - Together, Arlen, Mara, Fen, and Elira agree on terminology:
     - “Tools that listen.”
     - “Attuned cuts.”
   - For the Game Bible:
     - Attunement is defined mechanically as:
       - A hidden or explicit tag on:
         - Resource nodes
         - Tools
         - Recipes
       - Correct tag matches reduce failure, increase yield, or unlock unique outputs.

5. **Optional Alchemist Consultation**
   - If the player has access to early Alchemy (File 58):
     - An Alchemist NPC examines residue from failed tools.
     - Provides an alchemical observation:
       - Some failures show **patterns similar to minor corruption residue**.
   - This keeps the door open for Hollowroot and future arcs.

### Mechanics & Requirements

- Requires mid-range profession ranks (5–10) to feel meaningful but not punishing.
- Data design:
  - Attunement values referencing:
    - `material_family`
    - `source_region`
    - `tool_profile`
  - The quest logs which combinations the player tests, but completion only requires:
    - A minimum number of successful matches.

### Rewards

- Unlocks:
  - First tier of **Attuned Lodge Tools** as craftable items:
    - Attuned Forester’s Axe
    - Attuned Ember Pot Implements
    - Attuned Carpenter’s Chisel / Plane
- Provides:
  - Significant profession XP.
  - Strong rep with all three profession wings.
- Unlocks **Quest 5 – The Weight of a Name**.

---

## Quest 5 – The Weight of a Name

### Summary

The questline culminates in a **Lodge ceremony** where the player helps formalize the new standards: attuned tools, documented methods, and acknowledgment that Greatwood itself is a partner (and sometimes an opponent). The player’s choices affect **which NPCs are credited** and **how strict the Lodge will be** about future resource usage.

### Starting NPC

- Clerk Elira, who has turned the sample shelves into a display of “Before” and “After”.

### Quest Beats

1. **Drafting the Standard**
   - Elira asks the player to help choose language for a:
     - “Lodge Standard on Greatwood Tools and Materials.”
   - Player makes 2–3 light-choice decisions:
     - Emphasis on:
       - Safety vs experimentation.
       - Respect for the forest vs efficiency.
   - Choices slightly influence:
     - Future flavor of profession barks.
     - How certain NPCs describe Lodge policy.

2. **Ceremony of Names**
   - In the Lodge hall, Arlen, Mara, Fen, and other NPCs gather.
   - The first **Attuned Tools** are:
     - Presented.
     - Officially named (e.g. “Firstgrain Pattern Axe,” “Emberbound Lid”).
   - The player:
     - Helps present them.
     - Is publicly credited in dialogue as one of the first “listeners”.

3. **Private Conversations**
   - After the ceremony:
     - Short optional dialogues with each profession lead:
       - Arlen: acknowledges that the forest might be more than just lumber.
       - Mara: invites the player to help experiment with “listening recipes.”
       - Fen: offers a more advanced commission or blueprint.

4. **Loose Ends and Warnings**
   - An Alchemist or hunter may quietly warn:
     - “Some of these patterns look a little like the ones near Hollowroot.”
   - This gently points the player toward:
     - Future corruption content.
     - Hunts and Deeds that deal with resource-tainted enemies.

### Mechanics & Requirements

- Requires completion of all prior quests.
- No heavy mechanics beyond:
  - Dialogue choices.
  - Acceptance of final tool crafting tasks (crafting or assembling the first attuned tools).

### Rewards

- Crafting recipes / items:
  - Player unlocks personal **Attuned Tool** recipes (or receives one free tool).
- Reputation:
  - Large one-time boost to all three profession tracks.
  - Unlocks Title or descriptor:
    - e.g. “Toolbinder”, “Listener of Grain”, or similar.
- World changes:
  - Certain old “broken tool” props in the Lodge are replaced with:
    - Fixed or displayed versions.
  - Some failure-rate modifiers in Greatwood resource zones are adjusted:
    - Fewer random failures when using attuned tools.

---

## System Integration Notes

### With 51–55 – Ingredients, Cooking, Professions

- All materials referenced in the questline must map directly to:
  - Ingredient families in **51 – Greatwood Ingredient Taxonomy**.
  - Early recipes and profession tasks in **52–57**.
- Attunement uses:
  - The same classification that recipes use for:
    - Wood type
    - Clay source
    - Ore quality

### With 58 – Alchemy

- Alchemy is **not required**, but:
  - Provides optional steps in Quests 3–5.
  - Gives early glimpses of:
    - “Material resonance”
    - Overlap between mundane flaws and magical corruption.

### With 59 – Lodge Profession Reputation Tracks

- Every quest step should award:
  - Small, clearly tagged amounts of:
    - Forester’s Circle rep
    - Ember Kitchen rep
    - Carpenter’s Hall rep
- Completion of the arc:
  - Should unlock higher-tier profession quests and commissions.

### With 61–62 – Hunts, Greatwood Hunt Board & Deeds

- Certain Hunts and Deeds should mention:
  - Broken shafts, warped bows, spoiled rations.
- After completing Quest 5:
  - Some Hunt descriptions update to reflect:
    - Reduced tool failure.
    - New expectations for attuned gear.
- Deeds that involve:
  - Old burn-scars (D-GW-003 – Tracks in the Ash)
  - Whispering hollows (D-GW-004 – The Whisper in the Hollow)
  - Can reference:
    - The player as the one who first realized tools needed to “listen”.

---

## Implementation Sketch (Technical)

This section is for designers / scripters implementing the line.

### Quest Data

Each quest:

- Has:
  - `quest_id` (e.g. `Q_PROF_GW_BROKEN_TOOLS_01`)
  - `required_profession_ranks` (min per profession, can be 0)
  - `rep_rewards` per profession wing
  - `flags_set` when completed (for Hunt Board copy and world updates)

### Attunement Tags

Resources and tools gain tags such as:

- `material_family` (e.g. `oak`, `ashwood`, `riverclay`, `deepore`)
- `region_signature` (e.g. `greatwood_low_eaves`, `greatwood_burnscar`)
- `attunement_profile` (e.g. `flex_grain`, `ember_holding`, `support_load`)

Quest 4 & 5 ensure the player:

- Encounters tool behavior where:
  - Matching `attunement_profile` reduces:
    - Durability loss
    - Failure chance
  - Mismatching profiles may:
    - Increase splintering
    - Cause recipe flops

### World State Hooks

- Before the questline:
  - Decor objects:
    - Broken tools in Lodge.
    - Frustrated NPC barks.
- During the questline:
  - Temporary decorations:
    - Sample shelves
    - Markers on the Lodge map
- After completion:
  - New props:
    - Displayed “Firstgrain” tools.
  - Updated NPC bark library:
    - Less cursing about random breakage.
    - More talk about listening to the grain, respecting the pot, etc.

---

## Future Extensions

- **Region 2+ Questlines**
  - Similar “Broken Tools” arcs in other regions can:
    - Compare their resource temperament to Greatwood’s.
    - Introduce new attunement profiles (stone-heavy, metal-heavy, fungal, etc.).

- **Deep Corruption Variant**
  - A later, more dangerous follow-up arc could reveal:
    - Some failures weren’t just misattunement –
      they were early signs of **Hollowroot’s deeper influence**.

- **Player-Owned Workshop**
  - The player’s quarters (B100+) can:
    - Gain workbenches that visually change after this questline.
    - Let the player display prototype tools and attunement notes.
