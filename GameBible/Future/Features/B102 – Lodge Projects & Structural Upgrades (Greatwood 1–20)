B102 – Lodge Projects & Structural Upgrades (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define how the Greatwood Lodge evolves over time through:

Lodge-wide Projects (shared upgrades everyone feels).

Structural Upgrades to wings and services.

Integration with:

Personal quarters & identity (B100)

Labs & Warding Wing (B101)

Lodge Reputation & Circles (59)

Hunts & Contracts (61)

Professions & resources (95, forward ref)

This is the 1–20 slice: the Lodge is not static. As players hunt, cleanse, research, and contribute, the Lodge physically changes and gains new capabilities.

Core fantasy:

“My Lodge actually improves because of the work we do. When I walk through its halls at level 20, it’s clearly not the same place it was when I arrived.”

Design Pillars

Concrete, Visible Upgrades

Projects are not just numbers in a menu.

Each upgrade:

Changes the Lodge visually.

Unlocks or improves a specific feature.

Alters NPC behavior or ambient chatter.

Shared Progress, Personal Flavor

The Lodge upgrades are shared between all hunters.

Personal quarters (B100) add individual flavor on top.

Players feel:

“We built this place up together.”

“…and I carved out my own corner inside it.”

Projects as Sinks With Meaning

Projects consume:

Gold.

Resources from Professions.

Hunt trophies.

Corruption samples.

But in return:

Unlocks major conveniences and power.

Influence world systems (corruption creep, research efficiency).

Circle-Driven Politics

Different Lodge circles (59) sponsor different projects:

Huntmasters want training grounds and armories.

Wardens want wards and watchposts.

Scholars want upgraded Labs and libraries.

Lodge Proper wants dorms, kitchens, defenses.

Reputation affects:

Which projects you see.

Which you can sponsor or accelerate.

Expandable Blueprint

B102 is the base-building template.

Future Lodges, outposts, and expansions reuse this pattern:

Projects, categories, sponsors, visual evolution.

Core Concepts

We define four key concepts:

Lodge Project

Project Category

Project Sponsor

Project Resource Inputs

1. Lodge Project

A Lodge Project is:

A named, persistent upgrade to the Lodge or its immediate surroundings, such as:

“Expand the Infirmary Ward”

“Rebuild the East Training Yard”

“Extend Wards to Hollowroot Fringe”

“Open the Ember Gallery”

Each project has:

ID, name, flavor description.

Category & sponsor circle(s).

Requirements (inputs).

Time / condition to complete.

A set of tangible effects.

2. Project Categories (Greatwood)

For 1–20, we define six categories:

Infrastructure

Structural fixes and expansions:

Roof repairs, new dorms, kitchens, storage.

Services

Vendor, training, and station upgrades:

Better Alchemy stations, trainers, Hunt Board expansion.

Defense & Warding

Warding Wing and physical defenses:

Walls, watchtowers, ward stones (ties to B101, 91).

Research & Archives

Libraries, Labs, specimen halls:

Better research capacity, codex, experiments.

Social & Culture

Halls, common rooms, festival spaces:

Ceremonies, feasts, ambient scenes, social buffs.

Personal Spaces (Hook to B100)

Hunter quarters-related upgrades:

Quarters tiering, customization slots, trophy mounting.

3. Project Sponsor

Each project is sponsored by one or more circles (59):

Lodge Proper

Huntmasters’ Circle

Wardens’ Circle

Scholars’ Circle

Sponsor determines:

Required reputation threshold.

Thematic flavor.

Which circle(s) you gain extra rep with by completing it.

4. Project Resource Inputs

Projects consume:

Gold – basic currency.

Materials – from Professions (95):

Wood, stone, metal, textiles.

Reagents – alchemical and magical:

Herbs, essences, salts, corruption samples.

Favors / Tokens – meta resource:

Time / Hunts:

Some require:

X number of Hunts completed after funding.

A specific event trigger.

Project Flow

Progression & Tiering (Greatwood 1–20)

We define rough “tier” expectations:

Tier 0:

Intro, almost free.

Teaches system: e.g., “Patch the East Roof.”

Tier 1:

Affordable mid-early game.

Unlocks significant early functionality:

Infirmary expansion, training yard, ward stone restoration, Ember Gallery.

Tier 2:

Late Greatwood (14–20), more demanding.

Unlocks “complete” Greatwood Lodge state:

Quarters upgrade.

Wards reaching Hollowroot Fringe.

Hunt Board annex.

Codex Vault expansion.

By the time a player leaves Greatwood:

The Lodge should look:

Noticeably more built-out than when they arrived.

System-wise, they should have:

At least a couple of Tier 2 projects completed, others in progress.

Integration With Other Systems
With Circles & Reputation (59)

Each project:

Has one or more sponsor circles.

Requires a minimum rep rank with that circle.

Provides a rep bonus on completion (often more for the sponsor circle).

Political flavor:

If the player leans heavily into one circle:

They’ll see more of that circle’s projects unlocked faster.

Some projects may be:

Mutually exclusive in later tiers (beyond Greatwood).

With B100 – Personal Quarters & Identity

Personal quarters level and options are gated via Personal Spaces projects here.

B100 defines:

Specific room layouts.

Customization systems.

Identity hooks.

B102 ensures:

Those systems are narratively justified as “we carved space for you” and “now we upgraded those rooms.”

With B101 – Labs & Warding Wing

Infirmary and Lab upgrades:

Are implemented as B102 projects that modify B101 spaces.

Warding projects from B101:

Some require B102 structural upgrades first, e.g.:

“Reinforce Warding Hall supports” before adding more ward stones.

Research project slot increases and ward line expansions:

Are often B102 Lodge projects triggered from B101 UI.

With Hunts & Contracts (61)

Many Lodge projects:

Require completion of certain Hunts or contract categories.

The Hunt Board:

Can advertise specific projects as goals:

“Complete X corruption contracts to fund Wards to Hollowroot Fringe.”

Inversely:

Once projects are completed, Hunts may:

Use new spaces as locations.

Reference upgraded Lodge features.

With Corruption & Cleansing (91)

Defense & Warding projects:

Directly alter ZCL or creep.

Some advanced projects (beyond Greatwood):

Might risk increasing corruption in one region to protect another.

Failure, Reversals & Limits

In Greatwood 1–20:

Projects do not fully fail once funded:

You don’t lose your investment.

Progress might be delayed if certain events/losses occur.

However:

Severe corruption story events may:

Temporarily disable certain benefits.

Damage parts of the Lodge (future content hook).

Limits:

Cap on simultaneous active projects:

Example: 2 small + 1 major.

Encourages prioritization and pacing.

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

The B102 framework supports:

Region-specific Lodge identities:

Mountain Lodge: lots of defense and hunting yard projects.

Coastal Lodge: docks, shipwright, sea wards.

Faction divergence:

Player choices in which projects to fund:

Might shift Lodge ideology.

Could lock/unlock future storylines.

Season-style Lodge meta:

Rotating Lodge project sets tied to global events:

“Reinforce against flood season.”

“Prepare for the Ember Eclipse.”

But all future expansions should still look like:

New project cards on the Lodge board → visible structural changes → concrete systemic effects.
