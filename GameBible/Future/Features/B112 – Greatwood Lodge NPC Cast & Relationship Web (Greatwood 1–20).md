# B112 – Greatwood Lodge NPC Cast & Relationship Web (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define the core NPC cast of the Greatwood Lodge and how they:

Represent the Lodge circles (59, B105)

Anchor Hunts & Signature Hunts (61, B103)

Drive Corruption & Warding stories (91, B101)

Run Labs, Alchemy, & Professions (58, B108)

Gate Projects, Events, Festivals (B102, B104)

Reflect the player’s evolving identity (B100, B106, B110, B111)

This is not a full dialogue script; it’s the casting & web layer:

Who these people are, what they believe, how they clash, and how they see the player.

Design Pillars

Every System Has a Face

No abstract system.

Hunt Board = Huntmaster.

Wards = Warden of Wards.

Lab = Scholars.

Projects = a grumpy steward, etc.

When you do system stuff, you’re dealing with someone.

Circles Are People, Not Menus

Huntmasters, Wardens, Scholars:

Each has concrete leaders/champions.

You feel their politics and biases.

Small Cast, Deep Entanglement

Better to have:

8–12 deeply entangled NPCs

Than 40 forgettable ones.

Everyone:

Disagrees with someone.

Needs something.

Has an opinion about you.

NPC Opinions Change

As you:

Take Hunts.

Choose paths (Ragged King, Shadow Under the Wardstone, etc).

Engage with corruption.

NPCs react over time:

Rumors, greetings, event scenes.
