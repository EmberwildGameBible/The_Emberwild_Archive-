    -- GREATWOOD RELICS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_VEILPIERCER_DAGGER = [[
Veilpiercer was first carried by a nameless poacher who stalked ...e way it should, as if it cuts more than the air in front of it.

Locals say the poacher slipped between branches and briars like ...he Thornspine Widow finally claimed him, his body was cocooned, 
wrapped, and drained above a camp that had never held a proper fire.

The dagger was found on the ground below, point sunk into the soi...is blade had simply slid free. Hunters who carry it now swear it
still leans toward gaps in watchlines and openings in curtains.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WISP_TOUCHED_CLOAK = [[
On certain nights, when a green-blue haze drapes the Greatwood a...oak of ordinary cloth that no longer moved like something woven.

The Wisp-Touched Cloak never quite sits still. Its hem flickers ...e what their chosen walker will do with their borrowed grace.]],


    LORE_RELIC_HEARTROOT_CROWN = [[
The first Heartroot Crown was grown, not forged. At the center o...t into a living throne, a circle of bark split and curved into a
circle that would not crack no matter how long the sitter stayed.

Later crowns took pieces from that first heartroot, trimmed and ...d what might happen if they simply gave one a forest of its own.]],


    LORE_RELIC_BLACKTHORN_HUNTS_BAND = [[
This band began life as a simple loop of leather used by a young... thorns bit deep and left the leather slick with sap and blood.

Rather than discard it, the hunter wound the band again and again...rrow jaws, until it fit like intent itself around their finger.

The Blackthorn Hunts-Band tightens in the moments before a shot ...someone will come back instead. It has not been wrong often.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SPINDLEGLASS_CHARM = [[
Spindleglass is what happens when spider silk, stormlight, and w...n they finally lit a lamp in that corner, the charm was waiting.

Worn at the throat or wrist, the charm cools noticeably when some...ever warmed again. No one in that lodge likes cobwebs anymore.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SILVERSAP_FLASK = [[
This squat little flask is made of ordinary tin, dented and scra... hollow, bone-dry, but it still smells like relief when opened.

Hunters pass the Silversap Flask around before night runs throug...hey will not be alone when they drink, no matter who is beside them.

It is always light enough to lift. It never sloshes. Those who d...do not remember lifting it at all, only finding it already in hand.]],


    LORE_RELIC_OLDLODGE_KEY = [[
The Oldlodge Key does not belong to any door still standing. It ...the day the new lodge opened its doors and the old one fell quiet.

It should have gone to a wall or a drawer, but instead it began t... keep eyes peeled for doors that do not like being watched closely.

Sometimes it leads to forgotten stores or rooms where the wood re...ose, but rarely both. Most people hang it up and let it rattle.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WARDEN_SILENT_WHISTLE = [[
This whistle looks like carved bone polished by years of handling. No one remembers who first carried it, only that it turned up in records after the first time a patrol came back from the deepwood with fewer injuries than expected and more stories about odd quiet.

When blown, the Silent Whistle does not make a sound that most hunters can hear. Instead, it pulls the forest a breath back, dampening branches and small-creature scurries just enough for trained ears to pick out the wrong footstep or the misplaced twig-snap.

Used too often, it earns the forest’s annoyance, and birds will leave entire routes empty for days. Used when it matters, it can mean the difference between an ambush and a stand. The whistle has never worked for anyone who wanted it for parade ground drills.]],


    LORE_RELIC_THORNSHADE_MANTLE = [[
Thornshade Mantle began as a simple hedge-witch’s charm: bramble...ver made it to the ground. They found the cloak still hooked high.

The Mantle hangs heavy, lined with small thorns that never quite ...enerally keep the thorns tucked in. It only bites when truly asked.]],


    LORE_RELIC_DUSKWARD_SIGIL = [[
The Duskward Sigil is not a traditional charm. It started as a scratch—someone idly dragging a knife tip in spirals across the wood near a watch post as they waited for shift change. Rain hit, then frost, and when the board was finally replaced the mark refused to sand out.

Someone pried the knot free and set it in a disc of iron. Since t... where a line between safe and dangerous ground needs drawing.

It doesn’t stop threats outright; it tells anyone who looks at i...their eyes that stepping past that mark will change something.]],


    LORE_RELIC_HOWLBOUND_WRAPPING = [[
This strip of dark cloth once bound the muzzle of a corrupted hun...ound the cloth tightened and then slowly went slack as it cooled.

The Howlbound Wrapping hums faintly when wrapped around a weapon ... better if it is never given the chance to grow used to the sound.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SAPSEER_MEDALLION = [[
The Sapseer Medallion looks simple: a disc of amber shot through with frozen lines that resembled roots or lightning, depending who they ask. It was harvested from a tree that had survived three different kinds of blight with more scars than branches.

Held up to the eye, the medallion tints the world a faint honey color and brings out stress lines in wood, bark, and bone—flaws that mean something is close to breaking. Wardens wear it when checking supports and rails. Healers borrow it when deciding which splints to remove first.

Sometimes, rarely, the lines inside shift. When that happens, the person using it usually finds a problem they had been walking around for weeks without seeing. The medallion cannot be polished back to clear; the sap inside refuses to forget what it has learned.]],


    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    -- GREATWOOD HUNT TROPHIES & TRACKER RELICS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_TRACKLANTERN_OF_THE_FIRST_CIRCLE = [[
This lantern hangs in the main hall of the First Circle lodge, its metal frame worn smooth where hands have polished it on their way in and out. The glass panes are replaced constantly, but the central fitting, the bit that actually holds the flame, has never been swapped.

Out in the field, hunters say copies of the Tracklantern never quite behave like this one. When its wick is lit at the start of a season, the flame burns with a steady blue-white core. It leans toward trails that still matter: fresh tracks, wounded beasts, missing patrols that have not yet gone too far.

On the rare nights it gutters or flares without warning, the lodge records those dates carefully. Every time so far, someone has staggered back through the doors within the week with a story that explains why the lantern refused to play at being just a lamp.]],


    LORE_RELIC_GREATWOOD_TALLYRING = [[
The Tallyring looks like a child’s counting toy—simple wooden beads on a loop of cord, some bright, some dull, some etched. In truth it is an old tracker’s log in physical form, beads added for every successful return, carved deeper for the hunts that should have killed them.

When worn on a belt or wrapped around a wrist, the Tallyring slides of its own accord when a group sets out, beads clacking quietly into place as if counting heads. If one goes missing, it leaves a bead hanging a half-step out of line until the tally is right again or accepted as lost.

Hunters argue over whether it is kinder to carve the lost bead full-dark or leave it half-marked. The ring does not care. It keeps counting.]],


    LORE_RELIC_EMBERTHREAD_SASH = [[
The Emberthread Sash is woven from lodge-dyed fibers and a single strand of something recovered from a burned-out wardline. The cloth is soft but unexpectedly heavy, the way garments become after days of rain, except it never actually feels wet.

Wrapped around the waist or shoulder, the sash heats slightly when the bearer draws near old battlegrounds, collapsed dens, or places where the Greatwood remembers violence. The warmth doesn’t judge between sides; it just acknowledges that something important happened under these branches.

Scouts use it when charting new paths, avoiding the warm patches when they want quiet routes and cutting straight through them when they want to remind recruits what the forest can do. It has never burned anyone, but a few swear their scars itch under it.]],


    LORE_RELIC_OLDTRACKER_BONEPIPE = [[
This pipe, carved from some large beast’s leg bone, belonged to a tracker who swore the forest only answered questions asked with patience. He would sit on stumps and hillcrests for hours, tapping an unlit pipe against his teeth while patrols shifted around him.

When someone finally looked closely at the pipe after he failed to come back from a solo run, they found the sides covered in tiny nicks and notches, each one neatly grouped. Taken together, they formed rough maps of game trails, burrows, and resting grounds across an entire valley.

Those who carry the Bonepipe now claim that when they sit and wait with it in hand, the forest arranges itself into patterns just a shade more obvious than chance. The pipe has never liked anyone in a hurry.]],


    LORE_RELIC_FARSCENT_VIAL = [[
Farscent began as an alchemist’s attempt to bottle “the feeling of coming home after a long track with all your limbs.” The result did not do that. Instead, the liquid in this glass vial holds the scent of distant rain on bark and turned soil, sharp and clean.

Uncorked in the Greatwood, the smell pulls the bearer’s attention toward paths that lead out rather than in. It does not point north or toward lodges, only in the direction that offers the most air, the most sky, the fewest times the branches lean over like teeth.

It is useless for hunters looking to go deeper, invaluable for search parties that want to get back before the light fails. No one has ever managed to refill it; the rain-scent returns on its own when the cork is pressed down firmly and the vial is left alone in the dark.]],


    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    -- WARDSTONE & LODGE RELICS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_WARDSTONE_ANCHOR_CHAIN = [[
This length of chain is all that remains of an early attempt to hold a Wardstone in place with purely physical means. The rest fused, shattered, or simply vanished when the stone decided it no longer liked the arrangement. The surviving links bear heat scars and hairline fractures shaped like lightning.

Carried on a belt or hung from a nail near doors, the chain rattles when a wardline is under strain. The sound is small but cuts through argument and sleep alike, bringing wardens running even if they do not know exactly where the problem lies.

The chain does not point, only protests. It remembers being asked to hold something too big to hold and now refuses to let anyone forget that wards require respect, not just hardware.]],


    LORE_RELIC_LODGE_HEARTHSTONE_FRAGMENT = [[
Once, the main hearthstone of the Old Lodge cracked clean through during a banquet, sending sparks and half-cooked food in all directions. No one was seriously hurt, but the night’s stories grew teeth in the retelling. The next day, a warden pried one of the fragments free and pocketed it.

That fragment, smoothed on one side by long use, warms when brought near genuine hospitality—pots on the boil for others, blankets laid out for cold travelers, a bunk cleared for someone who did not expect to sleep inside. It stays cool in rooms where grudges outweigh welcome.

Lodges pass the fragment between stewards, a quiet reminder that the building is only as strong as the heat it shares. It has gone missing twice and found its way back twice, always in the bag or pocket of someone who needed a place to stay that night.]],


    LORE_RELIC_MUSTER_BELL_CLAPPER = [[
The clapper was all that survived when a muster bell fell from its frame and cracked in half during a storm. The metal around it splintered; the clapper itself rang once as it hit the stone floor and then lay still.

Now, when held by the loop and swung gently, it produces no sound for anyone more than a few steps away. For those standing within arm’s reach, however, the vibration crawls up the bones like a shouted name. It cuts through hangovers, fatigue, and the heavy quiet that settles after bad news.

Used sparingly, it gathers people for real emergencies. Used too often, it trains everyone to flinch at the sight of it. The senior warden keeps it in a drawer and unlocks that drawer only when they are certain.]],


    LORE_RELIC_HUNTERS_LEDGER_CLASP = [[
The Ledger Clasp is a plain iron bracket from the spine of a long ledger that recorded contracts, bounties, and bad ideas in equal measure. The book itself burned in a lodge fire set accidentally by someone overconfident with lamp oil; the clasp landed intact on the only page that did not catch.

When affixed to new records—bound volumes, loose sheaves, even a board with chalk marks—the clasp seems to encourage clean entries. Scribbles stand out as wrong. Numbers that do not add up itch behind the eyes. People still lie, but they feel the urge to do it more carefully.

The clasp has become a quiet piece of infrastructure magic: a relic that makes bureaucracy just sharp enough to matter without turning into a cudgel. Most hunters are only aware of it when they sign for their pay and realize they have written the truth despite themselves.]],


    LORE_RELIC_STANDING_ORDER_SEAL = [[
This heavy seal once stamped the wax of orders that sent patrols out and brought them back. The original ring that carried it was cut off a commander who refused to leave their post even when the wardlines failed; now the seal sits in a block of wood, cool and stubborn.

Pressed into wax, clay, or even mud, the seal’s impression never quite fades before the order it marks is either fulfilled or truly abandoned. Scribes use it sparingly, aware that to stamp a command with it is to invite the world to take that command seriously.

In the corner of one lodge office, a drawer holds a stack of old orders whose seals still look fresh. No one wants to be the one to declare them finished.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WARDLINE_SURVEYOR_SCOPE = [[
This small brass scope started as a simple instrument for checking straight lines and distances on ward runs. Over years of adjustments and improvisations, it inherited pieces from other tools: bits of glass etched for spiritlight, rings meant to measure strain, a borrowed focusing screw from a broken rifle.

When sighted along a wardline, the scope shows flickers of weakness as tiny motes of dimmer light, points where the line has grown thin or tangled. It does not fix anything by itself, but it makes the invisible strain visible enough for ward teams to argue about the right solution.

Its last owner carved small notches into the barrel for every catastrophic failure they helped avert using it. The notches are shallow, but they wrap nearly all the way around.]],


    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    -- GREATWOOD & WARDSTONE RELICS — NEW ADDITIONS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_BLACK_SAP_DEVOURER_FANG = [[
This fang was cut from the Black-Sap Devourer after it finally stopped moving. The cut took three hunters, a warding circle, and a saw that had never failed on bone before. The sap inside tried to climb back up the steel the whole time.

Now the fang sits in a harness of iron and bark. When brought near fresh corruption it darkens and sweats a thin film of sap, as if remembering the grove it once anchored. Some hunters use that pulse as warning; others say it just means the forest has not finished the argument yet.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WARDSTONE_HEART_SHARD = [[
This shard was chipped from the core of a Wardstone during a controlled discharge, the sort of ritual usually written down three times before anyone dares to try it. The fragment should have gone dull the moment it left the circle, but it still hums if you press it against your teeth.

Worn on a chain or set into a charm, the shard beats a slow rhythm that never quite matches the bearer’s heartbeat. Wardens use it to tell when a nearby ward is being strained. Ordinary hunters only know that the world feels a step sharper when it is close.]],


    LORE_RELIC_GLOAMING_VIGIL_LANTERN = [[
The Gloaming Vigil Lantern began as a regular patrol lamp, the kind hung on hooks outside lodge doors at change of shift. One night it refused to go out, even after the oil ran dry, burning with a steady, colorless flame while the sky boiled with stormlight over Wardstone Hill.

Since then the lantern has burned only when dusk feels wrong rather than when it gets dark. The flame brightens when something is watching from the tree line and guttering when whatever it sensed decides to move. No one has managed to light it by hand.]],


    LORE_RELIC_HOLLOWROOT_COMPASS = [[
Carved from the center of a hollowroot knot and cased in simple brass, this compass was built by a surveyor who got tired of getting lost in warrens that never matched their own maps. The needle does not point north, or toward lodges, or even toward the open sky.

Instead, it turns toward whatever path leads a living thing back to ground it can stand on. In caves it likes exits. In tangled Greatwood pockets it favors deer tracks and old logging runs. No one has convinced it to point toward anything easy like a vault or a stash.]],


    LORE_RELIC_GRAVEWIND_PENNANT = [[
The Gravewind Pennant is a torn strip of regiment cloth that somehow survived a retreat no one wants to talk about in detail. The colors have bled down to dull gray, but the fabric never rots, even when left in rain and smoke for weeks.

When flown from a spear or lodge beam, the pennant hangs still in ordinary wind and only stirs when something has died nearby and not yet settled. Names whispered to it the night before a march have a way of coming back as rumors, written reports, or not at all.]],


    LORE_RELIC_ASHBOUND_TALISMAN = [[
This talisman is a ring of fused ash and bead-glass, strung on cord that should have burned long ago. It was pulled from the remains of a farmhouse fire where the stones in the hearth cracked but the family hidden in the root cellar came out breathing.

Held in a bare hand, the talisman grows warm near open flame and oddly cool near wild, unfocused burning. Hunters say it can tell the difference between a cookfire, a torch, and a blaze that has decided to stop listening to anyone. It never changes temperature for candlelight.]],


    LORE_RELIC_MOONLIT_HUNTSMANS_BAND = [[
This band is plain metal with a thin line of dull silver on the inside. It was found on a branch overhanging a ford where someone had clearly fallen in but left no body, only drag marks and a snapped rope.

Under a clear night sky, the band catches more light than it should and never fully disappears even in shadow. Those who wear it swear they see game before anyone else, not because their eyes are sharper but because the animals make one mistake instead of three. The price is a mild restlessness whenever the moon is new.]],


    LORE_RELIC_TWELVE_TRUE_PAGES_FRAGMENT = [[
This fragment is no larger than a palm, torn from one of the Twelve True Pages or a careful copy of them. Most of the ink is missing, leaving scattered words and half-lines that refuse to sit still in the reader’s memory.

When carried, the bearer finds themselves finishing sentences they have never read and reaching for the right question a moment earlier than they should. The fragment does not reveal secrets so much as shove people toward the ones already in the air. No one agrees which Page it came from.]],


    LORE_RELIC_STONEBINDER_GAUNTLETS = [[
These gauntlets are heavy leather overlaid with inset stone plates, each etched with half-faded ward-lines. They were designed for the teams who physically anchor chains and braces to active Wardstones, a job that breaks more hands than tools.

When worn, the fingers never quite feel numb, even in frost, and the bearer can tell when a stone under their grip is ready to crack or just complaining. Ward teams pass them between crews like a quiet blessing. Anyone else who tries them on complains of pins and needles and an urge to brace something.]],


    LORE_RELIC_RIVERGLASS_CHARM = [[
The Riverglass Charm is a smooth piece of clear stone drilled for a cord. It was taken from the riverbed below a collapsed bridge, where carts and people both went down in the same night storm. The glass was not shaped by heat that anyone can point to.

When worn, it distorts reflections in water, showing currents and snags more clearly than the surface should allow. Fishermen like it. Smugglers like it more. No one has managed to get it to show them anything that is not already in the river.]],


    LORE_RELIC_THORNWEAVE_CINCTURE = [[
This belt looks like wound bramble frozen mid-snarle, thorns pressed flat and wrapped in a thin band of leather. It came from a grove that once tried to push hunters back out of it and failed, leaving the plants dead in a perfect circle around an old camp.

The cincture tightens itself snugly around the wearer and stays there no matter how hard they move or fall. People say it bites deeper into attackers’ hands than bare bark would and leaves their fingers aching long after the cuts close. The wearer never snags on underbrush unless they deserve it.]],


    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    -- WIDER WORLD RELICS — NEW ADDITIONS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_SECOND_DAWN_LANTERN = [[
The Second Dawn Lantern spent years hanging over a watch post that never saw a true sunrise, only gray sky and snow glare. It was finally taken down when the last garrison rotated out and no one volunteered to replace them.

Now the lantern burns with a pale, steady light that makes every scar and crack around it stand out in hard detail. It does not make things warmer, only clearer. People who work under it tend to finish what they started or walk away entirely. There is no in-between while it is lit.]],


    LORE_RELIC_VOIDSTRIDE_BOOTS = [[
Voidstride Boots are not fancy; they are built like any other weatherproof leather, save for the faint black stitching that looks wrong at the edges of vision. They came from an expedition that mapped a pocket where sound and distance never agreed.

Worn on long marches or tight corridors, the boots muffle the wearer’s footfalls exactly as much as they intend. Scouts love them until the first time they realize they have not heard their own steps in an hour. After that, they either give the boots away or never take them off.]],


    LORE_RELIC_FATESPLIT_COINS = [[
Fatesplit Coins are a matched pair, one bright, one tarnished, both stamped with a sigil no mint claims. They turn up in lodge tills, under tavern tables, and in the pockets of people who swear they never carried them.

Flipped together, the coins almost never land the same way. Hunters use them for wagers they are not sure they want to win. Contract keepers use them to decide which of two bad routes to post. Everyone agrees that the coins do not make choices fair; they just make them honest.]],


    LORE_RELIC_EMBERBLOOM_PHIAL = [[
The Emberbloom Phial holds a small drift of orange-gold dust that never quite settles. It was collected from the center of a grove fire that burned hot enough to fuse soil but left one ring of flowers untouched and brighter than before.

Opened in a choke of smoke or a panic of shouting, the phial’s scent cuts through long enough for people to see where they are standing and who is still on their feet. The dust never seems to run out. The stopper grows harder to pull each time.]],


    LORE_RELIC_CARTOGRAPHERS_SCRIMSHAW = [[
This scrap of carved bone is covered in fine lines that only resolve into rivers and ridges when you hold it next to a map. It was found in an abandoned field tent, pinned beneath a half-finished survey of three valleys that do not quite match the current ones.

Carried in a pocket, it nudges maps, sketches, and even idle doodles toward more accurate shapes. People tracing routes while holding it often realize there is a better line a ridge over. It cannot make new roads, only reveal the ones someone once tried to record.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SKYMARKED_JAVELIN = [[
The Skymarked Javelin is scarred along its length by black, jagged lines where lightning followed the grain and forgot to leave. It was thrown once from a cliff during a storm, vanished in the glare, and was later recovered embedded in stone far below.

When hurled now, the javelin seems to find the heaviest point in the air between thrower and target and drag itself along that line. It is not faster than other weapons, just more certain. People who throw it feel the impact in their shoulder long before they hear it.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WARDENS_ASHEN_PAULDRON = [[
This pauldron is made from plate salvaged off an old set of lodge guard armor that stood one watch too many during a wildfire season. The outside is blackened and pitted; the inside is lined with some lodge tailor’s careful hand-stitching.

Worn on one shoulder, it seems to pull blows and debris toward itself rather than letting them scatter. Wardens joke that it teaches people which side to turn when things go wrong. No one has managed to wear it while running away without tripping.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SILENT_BRANCH_CHARM = [[
A small twig bound in copper wire, the Silent Branch Charm comes from a tree that grew on the edge of an old execution ground where people eventually stopped screaming and started listening. The bark never quite took on the same color as the others around it.

Carried on a cord, the charm deadens the small sounds that give a person away in brush or loose stone. It does not make its owner invisible or weightless, only quiet. Many hunters lose it on purpose once they realize they have started expecting the forest to do all the work for them.]],


    LORE_RELIC_FIRST_RAVEN_FEATHER = [[
This feather is broader and heavier than any local bird’s, kept in a simple bone tube. It fell onto a lodge roof the night a storm split three trees along the ridge and left the building untouched.

When laid flat on a table, the feather tilts toward whatever carries bad news nearest to the door that day: letters, boots, an empty stretch of road. Messengers hate it. Captains love it. The feather has never once pointed toward good tidings.]],


    LORE_RELIC_RUSTBOUND_LOCKET = [[
The Rustbound Locket is ugly work by modern standards, all hard edges and poorly hidden hinges. Inside is space for a portrait, but every attempt to place one inside ends with the paper turning gray and flaking apart.

People who wear it report flashes of places that no longer exist: streets without ward-lamps, fields without stump lines, rivers crossing where they no longer can. The visions are not visions of other worlds, just older versions of this one. Most people stop opening it after the third or fourth time.]],


    LORE_RELIC_CINDERBORN_MASK = [[
The Cinderborn Mask is a soot-stained half-mask found on a hook in a tunnel where the smoke should have suffocated anyone without it. The fabric padding smells faintly of lime, charcoal, and something sharp enough to hurt.

When pulled on, it filters out ash, dust, and most of the stink from crowded bunkrooms, but it does nothing to quiet sound or fear. People wearing it tend to speak less anyway. The eyeholes always feel a touch too wide, like they expect more flame than there is.]],


    LORE_RELIC_MIREWALKERS_SPURS = [[
These spurs are plain iron, their only decoration a faint green-black stain that will not scrub out. They were pulled off the boots of a guide who walked into a swamp pocket three times and came back each time with every client alive.

Worn on any footwear, the spurs make mud and shallow water feel a little more honest underfoot. You still sink, but rarely further than you expect. Riders claim their mounts find safer footing while the spurs jingle, as if someone else is checking the ground ahead.]],


    LORE_RELIC_TIDECREST_SHELL = [[
The Tidecrest Shell is a single large shell from a coastline most Greatwood-born hunters will never see. It turned up in a crate of salted fish that had taken too long to arrive and spoiled everywhere but around the shell itself.

Held to the ear, it carries not a roar of surf but a clear, slow rhythm like distant oars. People far inland find it either comforting or unbearable. Those who keep it nearby tend to make their choices in time with that beat, as if reminded that currents exist even when you cannot see water.]],


    LORE_RELIC_NIGHTVEIL_PROWLER = [[
Nightveil Prowler is not a dagger built for show. The blade is s...ike dried blood that refuses to either flake away or stay still.

Assassins who favor the Prowler say it remembers where it has be...mply offers to be exactly as cruel as the hand that holds it.]],


    LORE_RELIC_DAWNSONG_COVENANT = [[
The Dawnsong Covenant is not a single vow but an accumulation of...e”—all of those words went somewhere. Some settled in this mace.

Its head glows softly at the edges in low light, never bright en...itself refuses to break the promises its bearers keep making.]],


    LORE_RELIC_HEARTROOT_RELIQUARY = [[
The Heartroot Reliquary is a box for things that do not fit anyw...rown, hollowed gently and lined with sap that never quite dries.

When worn, the reliquary stays warm even in deep frost, as if it... felt like to be helped and nudges its bearer to do the same.]],
