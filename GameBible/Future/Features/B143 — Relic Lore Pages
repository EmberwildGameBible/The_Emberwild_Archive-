    -- GREATWOOD & WARDSTONE RELICS — NEW ADDITIONS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_BLACK_SAP_DEVOURER_FANG = [[
This fang was cut from the Black-Sap Devourer after it finally stopped moving. The cut took three hunters, a warding circle, and a saw that had never failed on bone before. The sap inside tried to climb back up the steel the whole time.

Now the fang sits in a harness of iron and bark. When brought near fresh corruption it darkens and sweats a thin film of sap, as if remembering the grove it once anchored. Some hunters use that pulse as warning; others say it just means the forest has not finished the argument yet.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WARDSTONE_HEART_SHARD = [[
This shard was chipped from the core of a Wardstone during a controlled discharge, the sort of ritual usually written down three times before anyone dares to try it. The fragment should have gone dull the moment it left the circle, but it still hums if you press it against your teeth.

Worn on a chain or set into a charm, the shard beats a slow rhythm that never quite matches the bearer’s heartbeat. Wardens use it to tell when a nearby ward is being strained. Ordinary hunters only know that the world feels a step sharper when it is close.]],


    LORE_RELIC_GLOAMING_VIGIL_LANTERN = [[
The Gloaming Vigil Lantern began as a regular patrol lamp, the kind hung on hooks outside lodge doors at change of shift. One night it refused to go out, even after the oil ran dry, burning with a steady, colorless flame while the sky boiled with stormlight over Wardstone Hill.

Since then the lantern has burned only when dusk feels wrong rather than when it gets dark. The flame brightens when something is watching from the tree line and guttering when whatever it sensed decides to move. No one has managed to light it by hand.]],


    LORE_RELIC_HOLLOWROOT_COMPASS = [[
Carved from the center of a hollowroot knot and cased in simple brass, this compass was built by a surveyor who got tired of getting lost in warrens that never matched their own maps. The needle does not point north, or toward lodges, or even toward the open sky.

Instead, it turns toward whatever path leads a living thing back to ground it can stand on. In caves it likes exits. In tangled Greatwood pockets it favors deer tracks and old logging runs. No one has convinced it to point toward anything easy like a vault or a stash.]],


    LORE_RELIC_GRAVEWIND_PENNANT = [[
The Gravewind Pennant is a torn strip of regiment cloth that somehow survived a retreat no one wants to talk about in detail. The colors have bled down to dull gray, but the fabric never rots, even when left in rain and smoke for weeks.

When flown from a spear or lodge beam, the pennant hangs still in ordinary wind and only stirs when something has died nearby and not yet settled. Names whispered to it the night before a march have a way of coming back as rumors, written reports, or not at all.]],


    LORE_RELIC_ASHBOUND_TALISMAN = [[
This talisman is a ring of fused ash and bead-glass, strung on cord that should have burned long ago. It was pulled from the remains of a farmhouse fire where the stones in the hearth cracked but the family hidden in the root cellar came out breathing.

Held in a bare hand, the talisman grows warm near open flame and oddly cool near wild, unfocused burning. Hunters say it can tell the difference between a cookfire, a torch, and a blaze that has decided to stop listening to anyone. It never changes temperature for candlelight.]],


    LORE_RELIC_MOONLIT_HUNTSMANS_BAND = [[
This band is plain metal with a thin line of dull silver on the inside. It was found on a branch overhanging a ford where someone had clearly fallen in but left no body, only drag marks and a snapped rope.

Under a clear night sky, the band catches more light than it should and never fully disappears even in shadow. Those who wear it swear they see game before anyone else, not because their eyes are sharper but because the animals make one mistake instead of three. The price is a mild restlessness whenever the moon is new.]],


    LORE_RELIC_TWELVE_TRUE_PAGES_FRAGMENT = [[
This fragment is no larger than a palm, torn from one of the Twelve True Pages or a careful copy of them. Most of the ink is missing, leaving scattered words and half-lines that refuse to sit still in the reader’s memory.

When carried, the bearer finds themselves finishing sentences they have never read and reaching for the right question a moment earlier than they should. The fragment does not reveal secrets so much as shove people toward the ones already in the air. No one agrees which Page it came from.]],


    LORE_RELIC_STONEBINDER_GAUNTLETS = [[
These gauntlets are heavy leather overlaid with inset stone plates, each etched with half-faded ward-lines. They were designed for the teams who physically anchor chains and braces to active Wardstones, a job that breaks more hands than tools.

When worn, the fingers never quite feel numb, even in frost, and the bearer can tell when a stone under their grip is ready to crack or just complaining. Ward teams pass them between crews like a quiet blessing. Anyone else who tries them on complains of pins and needles and an urge to brace something.]],


    LORE_RELIC_RIVERGLASS_CHARM = [[
The Riverglass Charm is a smooth piece of clear stone drilled for a cord. It was taken from the riverbed below a collapsed bridge, where carts and people both went down in the same night storm. The glass was not shaped by heat that anyone can point to.

When worn, it distorts reflections in water, showing currents and snags more clearly than the surface should allow. Fishermen like it. Smugglers like it more. No one has managed to get it to show them anything that is not already in the river.]],


    LORE_RELIC_THORNWEAVE_CINCTURE = [[
This belt looks like wound bramble frozen mid-snarle, thorns pressed flat and wrapped in a thin band of leather. It came from a grove that once tried to push hunters back out of it and failed, leaving the plants dead in a perfect circle around an old camp.

The cincture tightens itself snugly around the wearer and stays there no matter how hard they move or fall. People say it bites deeper into attackers’ hands than bare bark would and leaves their fingers aching long after the cuts close. The wearer never snags on underbrush unless they deserve it.]],

    -- WIDER WORLD RELICS — NEW ADDITIONS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    LORE_RELIC_SECOND_DAWN_LANTERN = [[
The Second Dawn Lantern spent years hanging over a watch post that never saw a true sunrise, only gray sky and snow glare. It was finally taken down when the last garrison rotated out and no one volunteered to replace them.

Now the lantern burns with a pale, steady light that makes every scar and crack around it stand out in hard detail. It does not make things warmer, only clearer. People who work under it tend to finish what they started or walk away entirely. There is no in-between while it is lit.]],


    LORE_RELIC_VOIDSTRIDE_BOOTS = [[
Voidstride Boots are not fancy; they are built like any other weatherproof leather, save for the faint black stitching that looks wrong at the edges of vision. They came from an expedition that mapped a pocket where sound and distance never agreed.

Worn on long marches or tight corridors, the boots muffle the wearer’s footfalls exactly as much as they intend. Scouts love them until the first time they realize they have not heard their own steps in an hour. After that, they either give the boots away or never take them off.]],


    LORE_RELIC_FATESPLIT_COINS = [[
Fatesplit Coins are a matched pair, one bright, one tarnished, both stamped with a sigil no mint claims. They turn up in lodge tills, under tavern tables, and in the pockets of people who swear they never carried them.

Flipped together, the coins almost never land the same way. Hunters use them for wagers they are not sure they want to win. Contract keepers use them to decide which of two bad routes to post. Everyone agrees that the coins do not make choices fair; they just make them honest.]],


    LORE_RELIC_EMBERBLOOM_PHIAL = [[
The Emberbloom Phial holds a small drift of orange-gold dust that never quite settles. It was collected from the center of a grove fire that burned hot enough to fuse soil but left one ring of flowers untouched and brighter than before.

Opened in a choke of smoke or a panic of shouting, the phial’s scent cuts through long enough for people to see where they are standing and who is still on their feet. The dust never seems to run out. The stopper grows harder to pull each time.]],


    LORE_RELIC_CARTOGRAPHERS_SCRIMSHAW = [[
This scrap of carved bone is covered in fine lines that only resolve into rivers and ridges when you hold it next to a map. It was found in an abandoned field tent, pinned beneath a half-finished survey of three valleys that do not quite match the current ones.

Carried in a pocket, it nudges maps, sketches, and even idle doodles toward more accurate shapes. People tracing routes while holding it often realize there is a better line a ridge over. It cannot make new roads, only reveal the ones someone once tried to record.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SKYMARKED_JAVELIN = [[
The Skymarked Javelin is scarred along its length by black, jagged lines where lightning followed the grain and forgot to leave. It was thrown once from a cliff during a storm, vanished in the glare, and was later recovered embedded in stone far below.

When hurled now, the javelin seems to find the heaviest point in the air between thrower and target and drag itself along that line. It is not faster than other weapons, just more certain. People who throw it feel the impact in their shoulder long before they hear it.]],


    LORE_RELIC_WARDENS_ASHEN_PAULDRON = [[
This pauldron is made from plate salvaged off an old set of lodge guard armor that stood one watch too many during a wildfire season. The outside is blackened and pitted; the inside is lined with some lodge tailor’s careful hand-stitching.

Worn on one shoulder, it seems to pull blows and debris toward itself rather than letting them scatter. Wardens joke that it teaches people which side to turn when things go wrong. No one has managed to wear it while running away without tripping.]],


    LORE_RELIC_SILENT_BRANCH_CHARM = [[
A small twig bound in copper wire, the Silent Branch Charm comes from a tree that grew on the edge of an old execution ground where people eventually stopped screaming and started listening. The bark never quite took on the same color as the others around it.

Carried on a cord, the charm deadens the small sounds that give a person away in brush or loose stone. It does not make its owner invisible or weightless, only quiet. Many hunters lose it on purpose once they realize they have started expecting the forest to do all the work for them.]],


    LORE_RELIC_FIRST_RAVEN_FEATHER = [[
This feather is broader and heavier than any local bird’s, kept in a simple bone tube. It fell onto a lodge roof the night a storm split three trees along the ridge and left the building untouched.

When laid flat on a table, the feather tilts toward whatever carries bad news nearest to the door that day: letters, boots, an empty stretch of road. Messengers hate it. Captains love it. The feather has never once pointed toward good tidings.]],


    LORE_RELIC_RUSTBOUND_LOCKET = [[
The Rustbound Locket is ugly work by modern standards, all hard edges and poorly hidden hinges. Inside is space for a portrait, but every attempt to place one inside ends with the paper turning gray and flaking apart.

People who wear it report flashes of places that no longer exist: streets without ward-lamps, fields without stump lines, rivers crossing where they no longer can. The visions are not visions of other worlds, just older versions of this one. Most people stop opening it after the third or fourth time.]],


    LORE_RELIC_CINDERBORN_MASK = [[
The Cinderborn Mask is a soot-stained half-mask found on a hook in a tunnel where the smoke should have suffocated anyone without it. The fabric padding smells faintly of lime, charcoal, and something sharp enough to hurt.

When pulled on, it filters out ash, dust, and most of the stink from crowded bunkrooms, but it does nothing to quiet sound or fear. People wearing it tend to speak less anyway. The eyeholes always feel a touch too wide, like they expect more flame than there is.]],


    LORE_RELIC_MIREWALKERS_SPURS = [[
These spurs are plain iron, their only decoration a faint green-black stain that will not scrub out. They were pulled off the boots of a guide who walked into a swamp pocket three times and came back each time with every client alive.

Worn on any footwear, the spurs make mud and shallow water feel a little more honest underfoot. You still sink, but rarely further than you expect. Riders claim their mounts find safer footing while the spurs jingle, as if someone else is checking the ground ahead.]],


    LORE_RELIC_TIDECREST_SHELL = [[
The Tidecrest Shell is a single large shell from a coastline most Greatwood-born hunters will never see. It turned up in a crate of salted fish that had taken too long to arrive and spoiled everywhere but around the shell itself.

Held to the ear, it carries not a roar of surf but a clear, slow rhythm like distant oars. People far inland find it either comforting or unbearable. Those who keep it nearby tend to make their choices in time with that beat, as if reminded that currents exist even when you cannot see water.]],
