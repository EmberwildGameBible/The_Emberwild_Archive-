B121 – Signature Hunt: Shadow Under the Wardstone (Encounter & Choice Spec)
Purpose

Define the Shadow Under the Wardstone Signature Hunt – the capstone Greatwood story that sits at the crossing of:

Corruption & wards (91, B101, B109)

Wardstone Hill pocket & landmarks (B113)

Ward-linked enemies & constructs (B114)

Gloaming Vigil & ward events (B104, B116 – V-series)

Contracts & support chains (B115–B116, especially SH-S4 “Whispers on the Hill”)

Roles & archetypes (B110)

Circle & identity axes (B105):

Lodge-Faithful ↔ Fringe

Merciful ↔ Ruthless

Cautious ↔ Reckless

This is the “what are you willing to do with power” Hunt, not just a boss fight.

Narrative Identity
What It Is

“Shadow Under the Wardstone” is:

A hybrid investigation + encounter + moral decision at Wardstone Hill.

The discovery that:

The central Wardstone’s power has been tampered with:

By a combination of external corruption pressure and internal human meddling.

The climactic moment where the player:

Decides what happens to:

The Ward network.

A rogue actor (or actors).

The balance between safety and experimentation in Greatwood.

The Shadow Itself

There are three overlapping “shadows”:

The Ward-Shadow

A warped echo: a spirit/construct mutation living in the stone’s reflection.

The Human Shadow

A rogue Lodge-affiliated figure:

Ward-adept or scholar/alchemist who has been using the Wardstone for their own ends.

The Moral Shadow

The shade of:

“What the Lodge is willing to tolerate in the name of survival or knowledge.”

The Hunt forces the player to confront all three.

To fully unlock all dialogue and options.

At minimum:

Player must have:

Investigated suspicious signs near Wardstone Hill (offerings, scratched wards, hidden notes).

Hunt Posting

Appears on Hunt Board as:

Signature Hunt: “Shadow Under the Wardstone”
Posted jointly by Keeper Maera, Warden Aelric, and Senior Scribe Elgath.

Brief description (paraphrased):

“Something roots beneath the Hill that the old Ward never saw fit to bind. The Wardstone hums wrong; apprentices wake with whispers in their teeth. This is no ordinary Hunt. Come sworn to truth, or don’t come at all.”

When accepted:

Player is summoned:

To a small council at Wardstone Hill:

Maera, Aelric, Elgath, and Neris.

Act I – Investigation on the Hill
Scene: Council at Wardstone Hill

NPC positions:

Maera:

Standing near base of central Wardstone.

Aelric:

Inspecting glyphs and cracks.

Elgath:

With scrolls of previous ward designs/records.

Neris:

On edge, excited and worried.

They present:

Symptoms:

Flickering minor wards.

Ward echoes appearing in places they shouldn’t.

Strange “feedback” when wards interact with Black Sap surges.

Suspicions:

Someone has channeled unauthorized energies through the Wardstone.

Something non-human has responded.

Investigation Objectives

The player must:

Examine 3–4 Wardstone-adjacent anomalies:

A stone with scratched-over glyphs.

A small hidden focus embedded near the base.

A blood-stained offering bowl tucked in a crevice.

A faint, shimmering ward-echo that responds differently than normal.

Decide:

How much of each finding to share with:

Maera (truth vs filtered).

Aelric (blunt vs softened).

Neris (excited vs cautious).

Some of this may have been influenced by SH-S4 choices.

Human Shadow: The Likely Suspect

Through clues & dialogue, suspicion narrows to:

A Warden adept / researcher (we can name them: e.g. Seren Kael), OR

A Scholar-lean apprentice who’s been meeting Neris in secret.

Design intention:

We want:

Someone sympathetic:

Genuinely trying to solve a problem:

e.g. find new ways to buffer Corruption.

But has:

Broken Lodge protocol and risked everyone.

Player is told:

The Wardstone itself is unstable:

A deeper ward-echo anomaly must be confronted in the chamber beneath.

Maera:

Authorizes you to descend with:

Aelric & Elgath (and maybe Neris, depending on prior choices).

Act II – Descent Beneath the Wardstone
Access

A previously sealed stairwell / tunnel is opened:

At the base of Wardstone Hill.

Design:

Short, tense dungeon:

Old stone corridors.

Faint, shifting ward-glow.

Occasional Ward Echo or bound construct.

Environment & Enemies

Ward Echoes:

Ghostlike defenders that:

Attack if the corrupted pattern is disturbed.

Bound Constructs:

Imperfect stone guardians:

Misfiring due to corrupted runes.

Ward-Twisted Enemies:

Possibly:

A corrupted Sap-Wolf or Resin Husk dragged in by the experimental warding:

Their attacks occasionally produce arcane arcs.

Mechanics:

Some fights:

Can be disarmed or bypassed with Ward/Scholar interactions:

Right dialogues/skills.

Or brute-forced.

The Hidden Lab / Ritual Nook

At mid-depth:

The party finds:

A small chamber used for unauthorized experiments:

Scattered notes.

Minor ward-foci.

Records of experiments:

Attempting to channel Corruption into the Wardstone to “train” it to handle worse surges.

Player can:

Search notes:

Discover the true intent:

The rogue was trying to build a ward capable of:

Withstanding a catastrophic surge (e.g. something worse than Devourer/Matron).

Decide:

How to frame these findings later:

Reckless salvation attempt?

Criminal endangerment?

Act III – The Shadow’s Heart (Boss / Encounter)
The Core Chamber

Final chamber beneath Wardstone:

Circular space with:

The underside of the central Wardstone as a massive ceiling presence.

Ward lines etched into floor & walls, flickering.

A semi-formed entity where the lines converge: the Ward-Shadow.

The rogue adept (Seren Kael or equivalent):

Is present at start of the scene:

Tired, partially corrupted by backlash.

Either:

Actively trying to stabilize the Shadow.

Or half-delirious, still channeling.

Pre-Fight Confrontation

Dialogue exchange:

Reveals:

Their motives:

Wanted to strengthen the Wardstone.

Believed:

Traditional wards are insufficient against the next wave of Corruption.

How they did it:

Fed controlled amounts of Black Sap / Corruption through ward foci.

The Wardstone responded:

Creating a new echo / entity.

Player can:

Lean:

Sympathetic (“You were trying to save everyone.”).

Condemning (“You endangered the Hill and the Lodge.”).

Pragmatic (“What matters is if we can fix it now.”).

Regardless, the Shadow destabilizes:

A surge of energy forces everyone back.

The Ward-Shadow coalesces into a hostile state.

Ward-Shadow: Encounter Identity

The Ward-Shadow is:

Non-physical echo imbued with:

Ward glyph shapes.

Arcane light.

Corruption streaks where experiments twisted its pattern.

Light HCL if you stand in corrupted sigils.

Visual:

Humanoid/construct silhouette made of:

Floating stone shards.

Halo of ward glyph fragments.

Dark cracks with faint Black Sap glimmers.

Arena Mechanics

The arena floor is:

A pattern of ward circles and lines.

Key features:

Stable Wards:

Blue-white glow.

Standing in them:

Reduces incoming arcane damage.

But might attract Shadow focus later.

Corrupted Wards:

Darkened, flickering, with sap-hued cracks.

Standing in them:

Builds HCL.

Increases chance of debuff.

Neutral Ground:

Avoiding:

Corrupted glyphs.

Phase Breakdown
Phase 1 – Fractured Echo

Fantasy: Shadow is incomplete, glitchy; tests are small but disorienting.

Movement:

Teleports between stable ward circles.

Abilities:

Echo Lance

Shoots narrow beams:

Along ward lines.

Damage:

Arcane.

Telegraph:

Lines glow ahead of time.

Counterplay:

Step off lines before discharge.

Disrupting Pulse

Small AoE around it.

Status:

SUPPRESSED (short duration).

Purpose:

Punish stack-up.

Ward Flip

Randomly flips:

One stable circle → corrupted.

One corrupted → stable.

Keeps:

Arena shifting.

Player learns:

To read:

Ward line telegraphs.

Circle states.

At ~70–75% HP, rogue adept attempts to help (channel from side), causing a partial stabilization that also empowers the Shadow → Phase 2.

Phase 2 – Bound Pattern

Fantasy: Shadow more solid; pattern locked in; hits harder but more predictable.

Movement:

Less teleport, more glide.

Abilities:

Glyph Barrage

Raises several hovering glyphs.

After brief delay:

They streak toward player.

Damage:

Arcane.

Counterplay:

Move behind stone columns / stable wards.

Ward Anchor

Temporarily “locks” one stable circle:

Player inside gets:

Reduced damage taken.

But can’t easily leave (ROOT-like effect) unless they brute-force it.

Good:

For soaking certain bursts.

Bad:

If corrupted flip hits later.

Sigil Collapse

Targeted corrupted circle:

Implodes into a small vortex.

Damage:

High if too close.

HCL:

Spike if in vortex.

Counterplay:

Don’t stand on corrupted circles long-term.

At ~40–45% HP, fight enters crucial decision territory:

Shadow begins echoing the rogue adept’s aura and voice.

You get options to:

Cooperate with adept to re-bind Shadow into Wardstone.

Or force Shadow to fully unravel and die.

Phase 3 – Rebinding vs Destruction

This phase is split based on player’s mid-fight decision:

Option 1 – Rebinding (Preserve & Harness)

Narratively:

You and the adept:

Attempt to stabilize the Shadow into a new, stronger pattern.

Mechanically:

Player must:

Stand on indicated stable circles.

Protect adept during small channel windows.

Avoid corrupt circles as they flare.

Shadow behavior:

Tries:

To break binding:

Strikes at adept.

Generates more disruptive pulses.

Win condition:

Reduce Shadow HP to low (e.g., 10–15%) and complete 2–3 binding channel cycles.

Result:

Shadow collapses inward but is:

Contained.

Wardstone:

Gains a new internal pattern that:

Can better handle Corruption surges.

Cost:

Potential long-term side effects unknown.

Option 2 – Complete Destruction (Purge)

Narratively:

Aelric (and possibly Maera) push:

“We burn this mistake out and rebuild the wards from scratch.”

Mechanically:

Player stops any binding attempts:

Interrupt adept if necessary.

Focuses solely on HP burn.

Shadow behavior:

Goes:

Fully hostile.

New ability:

Fracture Wave:

Radial blast:

Damages both players and ward structures.

Win condition:

Reduce HP to zero:

Before too many ward structures break.

Result:

Shadow shatters:

Glyph fragments disperse.

Wardstone:

Returns to:

More “traditional,” stable, but no stronger than before.

Risk:

Some permanent damage to deeper ward channels (narrative, not immediate mechanic).

Act IV – Judgment & Consequences
Human Shadow: The Rogue Adept’s Fate

Post-fight, in the core chamber or back on Hill:

The rogue (Seren Kael) stands trial in micro:

Player input:

Recommend:

Execution.

Exile.

Strict supervision / penance.

Full pardon (very fringe).

Maera & Aelric:

Weigh your recommendation heavily.

Final decision:

May depend on:

What you did with the Shadow (rebinding vs destruction).

How you framed their motives earlier.

Alignment & Circle Effects

Lodge-Faithful vs Fringe:

Rebinding Shadow + recommending harsh punishment:

Complex; could still be seen as Fringe due to altering wards, but Lodge-Faithful in justice.

Destroying Shadow + recommending mercy:

Lodge-Faithful in ward doctrine, Merciful in justice.

Rebinding + mercy:

Strong Fringe lean (embracing experimental ward paradigm).

Destroying + execution/exile:

Hard Traditionalist Warden / Lodge-Faithful.

Merciful vs Ruthless:

Handling of adept (mercy vs execution) dominates.

How you handled Ward-Shadow:

Rebind seen as attempt at salvage:

Lean Merciful / pragmatic.

Overkill, ignoring any chance at containment:

Lean Ruthless / risk-averse.

Cautious vs Reckless:

Rebinding:

Risky but possibly visionary.

Destroying:

Safer short-term.

Your behavior in fight:

Taking lots of HCL / ignoring warnings:

Reckless.

Careful use of wards, minimizing structural damage:

Cautious.
