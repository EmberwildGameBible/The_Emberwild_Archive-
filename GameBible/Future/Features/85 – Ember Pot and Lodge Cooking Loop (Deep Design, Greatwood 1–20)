# 85 – Ember Pot & Lodge Cooking Loop (Deep Design, Greatwood 1–20)

## Purpose

Define the **core Ember Pot system** and the broader **Lodge cooking loop**:

- How daily/weekly Ember Pot contributions work
- How personal vs communal cooking is split
- How recipes, ingredients, and events tie together (52, 53, 55, 56, 64)
- How this loop supports:
  - Rest & recovery (70)
  - Social identity and Lodge politics (64, 83)
  - Long-term progression and professions (59)

Goal: make the Ember Pot feel like the **beating heart of the Lodge** – mechanically and emotionally.

---

## Core Concept

The Ember Pot is:

- A **huge communal cauldron** maintained by the Keeper of the Ember and the kitchen staff.
- Fed by:
  - Hunts
  - Foraging
  - Fishing
  - Player-crafted ingredients and dishes.
- Outputs:
  - Communal meals that:
    - Provide buffs.
    - Serve as milestones for Lodge health and mood.
  - Narrative beats and festival moments.

Player has **two parallel cooking experiences**:

1. **Personal Cooking** – small meals, travel food, experimental recipes.
2. **Ember Pot Contributions** – big communal stews and celebratory dishes.

---

## Ember Pot Daily/Session Loop

### Basic Flow

1. Player returns from the field with:
   - Meat, fish, herbs, mushrooms, etc. (51, 55, 78).
2. At the Ember Pot:
   - They can:
     - **Contribute ingredients**.
     - **Turn in specific recipe requests** for the daily/week stew.
3. Pot fills a **“Satisfaction Meter”** or “Hearty Ember” meter over time.

When the Pot reaches certain thresholds:

- The Lodge enters **“Well-Fed”** state for some duration:
  - Mild buffs to all hunters in Greatwood.
- At higher thresholds:
  - Triggers **special meal events** (Ember Night Feast variants, 64).

---

## Pot Metrics & States

### Ember Pot Meter

- Abstract measure of:
  - How well the Pot has been fed recently.
- Segments:
  - Empty → Barely Enough → Hearty → Abundant → Feast-Ready

**Empty / Barely Enough:**

- Lodge mood:
  - Idle lines about lean times.
- Buffs:
  - No global food buff.
- Keeper of the Ember:
  - Will explicitly ask for contributions.

**Hearty:**

- Lodge mood:
  - More relaxed lines.
- Buffs:
  - Small global buff, e.g.:
    - +1–2% HP/stamina regen out of combat for all players.

**Abundant:**

- Lodge mood:
  - Lively; some unique idle scenes unlocked.
- Buffs:
  - Slightly stronger global buff.
- Unlocks:
  - Potential for Feast triggers (if other conditions met).

**Feast-Ready (Threshold Reached):**

- Allows triggering:
  - Ember Night Feast or similar event (64).
- Post-feast:
  - Ember Pot meter partially resets.

---

## Player Contributions

### Ingredient Contribution

Players can:

- Toss in:
  - Raw meat, fish, mushrooms, herbs.
- System:
  - Each ingredient type has:
    - A base “Heartiness” value.
    - Possible **tags** (meaty, hearty, spicy, bitter, etc.)

Contributions:

- Increase Pot meter.
- May shift **flavor profile** of the stew (for story/UI flavor only in 1–20).

Keeper of the Ember may comment on:

- Overuse of certain ingredients:
  - “If you keep bringing only boar, we’re going to get sick of it.”

### Recipe-Based Contributions

Advanced system where player:

- Fulfills **specific Ember Pot recipes** requested by Keeper:

  - e.g., “Hollowroot Deep Stew,” “Storm-Caught Fish Chowder.”

These:

- Require:
  - Specific ingredients, sometimes from Deeds/Hunts.
- Provide:
  - Big Pot Meter jumps.
  - Special buffs & story beats.

---

## Personal Cooking vs Ember Pot

### Personal Cooking

- Done at:
  - Ember Kitchen private stations.
  - Camps (77) with simple pots/pans.
- Produces:
  - Individual dishes and travel rations.
- Buffs:
  - Direct personal buffs (HP, stamina, perception, etc.)

### Ember Pot Cooking

- Communal.
- Produces:
  - Global or Lodge-wide buffs.
  - Narrative states and events.
- Often requires:
  - Team effort / repeated contributions over time.

---

## Buff Philosophy

### Personal Food Buffs

- Shorter duration (e.g. 20–45 minutes).
- More targeted:
  - “Hunter’s Stew”: HP + stamina regen.
  - “Sharp-Eye Broth”: Perception & crit.

### Ember Pot Buffs

- Longer, mild Lodge-wide effects:
  - e.g. 60–90 mins of:
    - Slight stamina regen out of combat.
    - Slight discount on certain Lodge services (Quartermaster).
- Feast-level effects:
  - During/after a major event:
    - Stronger buffs for a shorter window (e.g., big hunt preparation).

Buff stacking rules:

- Personal food can stack with Ember Pot buff **within reason**:
  - Keep numbers moderate so stacking doesn’t break tuning.

---

## Social & Political Hooks (64, 83)

- Ember Pot status visible in:
  - UI at Lodge.
  - NPC chatter:
    - “Pot’s looking thin.” vs “Pot’s overflowing today.”
- Council:
  - Occasionally calls for:
    - “Contribute to the Pot before we attempt X hunt.”
- Quests:
  - Some story beats revolve around:
    - Pot being poisoned, corrupted, or sabotaged (future arcs).
    - Pot being used as stage for reconciliation or celebration.

---
