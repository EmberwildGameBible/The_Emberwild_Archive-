# 65 – Hollowroot Warren Dungeon: Layout, Bosses, Loot & Identity

## Purpose

Define the **primary Greatwood dungeon** – Hollowroot Warren – as:

- A corrupted root-system / burrow complex beneath the forest
- The main 1–20 dungeon for Greatwood
- A key source of:
  - Hollowroot ingredients (51, 55)
  - Advanced Cooking & Alchemy hooks (53, 58)
  - Hunts, Deeds, and quests (56, 60, 61)

This spec covers layout, enemy families, boss concepts, loot identity, and integration.

## Core Fantasy

- You are entering the **rotting nerve system** of Greatwood.
- Twisted roots, cramped tunnels, pockets of fungus, and dens of warped beasts.
- Feels like a mix between:
  - Burrow network
  - Root-cave
  - Proto-corruption nest

Tone: unsettling, dim, organic, not purely “stone dungeon”.

## Layout Overview

### Structure

- **Entrance Area** – shallow tunnels beneath the forest
- **Mid-Tier Chambers** – fungal caverns, root galleries, beast dens
- **Depths / Core** – heart of the corruption source

Suggested layout model:

1. **Entry Zone (1–3 rooms / tunnels)**
   - Tutorial for tight spaces and line-of-sight
   - Weak corrupted beasts and basic environmental hazards

2. **Mid Zone A – Fungal Galleries**
   - Larger rooms with fungal growths and Hollowroot clusters
   - More complex combat spaces (pillars, cover, choke points)

3. **Mid Zone B – Warren Tangles**
   - Maze-like root corridors with side dens
   - Optional side rooms (mini-boss, loot stashes)

4. **Core Chamber – Hollow Heart**
   - Primary boss arena
   - Visual “source” of corruption (root-heart, fungal bloom, or entity)

Option: small “post-core” chamber for story/lore reward.

## Enemy Families

### Base Foes

1. **Root-Twisted Vermin**
   - Small, fast, annoying; swarm tactics.
   - E.g., root-rat variants, burrowing insects.

2. **Fungal Thralls**
   - Corrupted small animals or humanoid remains twisted by fungus.
   - Slow, dangerous in groups, support mechanics (poison, slow).

3. **Burrow Beasts**
   - Mid-sized predators adapted to tunnel fighting.
   - Lunges, knockdowns, tight-space pressure.

### Elite / Special

4. **Hollowroot Guardians**
   - Heavier enemies that guard key chambers.
   - Abilities tied to roots (impale from ground, entangle, shield with bark).

5. **Sporecasters**
   - Ranged, fungus-based casters.
   - Create dangerous zones, clouds, or healing spores for allies.

## Boss Concepts

### Boss 1 (Optional Mini-Boss) – “The Tangled Warden”

- Location:
  - Mid-zone side chamber or midway choke point.
- Visual:
  - Heavily root-and-bark-armored beast or humanoid mutating into a root statue.
- Mechanics:
  - Phases of:
    - Root shield (reduced damage from front)
    - Ground spikes or entangling vines
    - Calls in root vermin waves
- Reward:
  - Mid-tier loot:
    - Chance at `hollowroot_sprig`, `hollowroot_resin`
    - Moderate gear upgrades aligned to forest/dungeon survival

### Final Boss – “The Hollow Heart”

Several possible forms (pick one or blend):

1. **Root-Heart Entity**
   - A giant, beating knot of roots and fungal mass.
   - Attacks:
     - Root lashes
     - Spore clouds
     - Summons thralls

2. **Corrupted Beast Lord**
   - Large beast that has become the core’s guardian.
   - Attacks:
     - Charge / slam in tight arenas
     - Corrupted roar that calls adds

3. **Hybrid**
   - Beast fused to a root-heart; kill phases:
     - Phase 1: mobile beast
     - Phase 2: beast retreats / roots up, more environmental hazards

Mechanics goals:

- Emphasis on **positioning** in cramped space
- Environmental hazards (root spikes, spores)
- Clear windows for “safe damage”
