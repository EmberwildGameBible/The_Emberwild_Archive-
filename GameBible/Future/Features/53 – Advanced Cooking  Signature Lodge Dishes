# 53 – Advanced Cooking 10–20: Signature Lodge Dishes

## Purpose

Define a set of **higher-tier Cooking recipes** (skill 10–20) that feel like true Lodge “signature dishes.” These should:

- Use **rarer ingredients** from the Greatwood taxonomy (51)
- Build on patterns taught in the early recipe grid (52)
- Provide **meaningful, themed buffs** for hunters doing serious content (elites, dungeons, night hunts)
- Feel **memorable and flavorful**, not just “+X% generic buff”

This doc is for design. Numbers can be tuned later.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Identity first, numbers second**  
   These are iconic meals. Names, lore, and sources should stick in the player’s brain.

2. **Rarer ingredients, rarer buffs**  
   Use Uncommon/Rare/Exotic items (Elder Stag meat, Whisperfern, Hollowroot, Ashcurl, Red Vein, specialty spices).

3. **Multi-step feeling**  
   Some recipes can *feel* like multi-step (marinating, smoking) even if technically you just gather the ingredients.

4. **Synergy with hunting and professions**  
   Tie recipes to:
   - Lodge hunts and bosses
   - Woodworking / Forester / future Alchemy
   - Night-only or weather-based hunts

---

## Recipe Structure

Same format as 52, but with stronger emphasis on:

- Rarity of ingredients
- Unlock/source (quest chains, reputation ranks, bosses)
- Unique “hook” per dish

Each entry:

- **ID:** `recipe_...`
- **Display Name**
- **Tier:** Advanced 1–5 (internal)
- **Required Cooking Skill:** 10–20
- **Ingredients:** IDs from taxonomy
- **Effect:** mechanical summary
- **Duration:** in-game minutes
- **Source:** quest, rep, dungeon, rare drop
- **Flavor Text**

## Integration Notes

- These recipes should not be available to a fresh player. They’re tied to:
  - Boss kills
  - Dungeon runs
  - Reputation ranks
  - Quest arcs

- They should **not** completely outclass alchemy or future professions; they live alongside them.

---

## Next Actions

- Expand each concept into full entries with exact ingredients and numbers once balance is clearer.
- Decide which recipes are:
  - Bound to the player (recipe learned permanently)
  - Craftable only at specific stations (Ember Pot, Lodge kitchen)
- Hook recipes into:
  - Lodge reputation thresholds
  - Specific quest rewards
  - Dungeon/world boss loot tables
