## 1. Role in Greatwood

**Name:** Elder Hollow Stag  
**Region:** Deep Greatwood groves, near Heartwood glades  
**Band:** Mid Greatwood (recommended 12–18)  
**Type:** Signature Hunt – iconic “forest guardian” encounter, not pure corruption

### 1.1 Narrative Identity

The Elder Hollow Stag is:

- The **ancient heart** of Greatwood’s wild herds:
  - Half-myth to villagers, half-real to Wardens.
- A massive stag suffused with **Heartwood**:
  - Antlers threaded with ambered sap and faint wardlight.
- Not inherently malicious:
  - It **rampages** when the forest is out of balance
    (too many kills, ward disruption, Hollowroot spread etc.).

It anchors:

- “Pure forest” side of Greatwood, as a counterpoint to:
  - Hollowroot Matron (corruption-plant horror),
  - Black-Sap Devourer (corrupt sap beast).

Mechanically it owns:

- Heartwood/antler specialties:
  - `spec_ingr_elder_stag_marrow`
  - `spec_ingr_heartwood_antler_core`
  - `sapstained_antler` family (55)
- High-tier venison:
  - `elder_stag_meat` (51)
- Food lines:
  - Feast and Lodge dishes centered on venison + heartwood (52/53)
- Trophies & Lodge projects:
  - Elder Stag antler mount, Heartwood decor (57)

---

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Recommended Placement

Elder Stag should feel like the **first big “oh shit” Hunt**:

- Less grotesque than Hollowroot/Black Sap,
- More about respect for the forest and balance.

It’s a great **first major Hunt** before the deeply corrupted stuff, IF the player:

- Has done:
  - Basic Hunts / contracts (wolves, boar, simple deer culls),
  - Some Lodge cooking quests (56 – Ember Pot),
  - Maybe a Wardstone visit.

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **“Too Many Bones”**
   - Contract:
     - Reports of overhunted clearings; deer vanish, wolves hungry.
   - Player:
     - Fulfills some standard culling contracts (boar/wolves).
     - Notices **signs of something much larger** (hoofprints, scraped bark).

2. **Whispered Tracks**
   - NPC Hunter/Warden:
     - Mentions “an older stag that should not be disturbed unless the forest is sick.”
   - Player:
     - Tracks huge hoof signs,
     - Finds **ward-carved trees** and places where antlers have scored bark.

3. **Sign of Imbalance**
   - Ward NPC or Cook notes:
     - Meat quality from normal deer is off.
     - Foragers report:
       - Trees bleeding sap in odd patterns near stag trails.
   - Quest:
     - Investigate three “sign sites”:
       - One overhunted clearing,
       - One Hollowroot seep,
       - One broken wardstone.

4. **Hunt Posting – “Elder Hollow Stag”**
   - Once imbalance is clear:
     - Board unlocks the named Hunt.
   - Text emphasizes:
     - This is as much **ritual and judgment** as it is a kill mission.

5. **Aftermath**
   - Depending on how the Hunt is completed:
     - Dialogue can imply:
       - The forest is quieter, more stable.
       - Or that “something else will rise to replace him.”

---

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Layout

The arena is a **Greatwood heart grove**:

- A wide forest hollow with:
  - Central **Heartwood Tree** (massive trunk, faint glow).
  - Several **standing stones** with old ward carvings.
  - Thick underbrush and low fog.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **Heartwood Tree Area (Center)**
  - Slight passive **regen / calm aura**:
    - Lowers ambient damage,
    - Might reduce the Stag’s aggression if used correctly.
  - During the fight:
    - Becomes focus for certain mechanics (Stag charges, ritual pulses).

- **Standing Stones**
  - 3–5 stones around the arena.
  - Interactable:
    - When activated in certain sequences:
      - Create temporary safe zones,
      - Influence Stag behavior (enrage vs calm).

- **Brush / Understory**
  - Tall grass / bushes:
    - Can hide **Stag telegraphs** if players aren’t careful.
  - Some clusters:
    - Can be burned / cleared (Ashen synergy) for safer sight lines.

---

## 4. Boss: Elder Hollow Stag – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Beast / Heartwood-touched Guardian  
**Fight Length Target:** ~3–6 minutes

### 4.1 Core Themes

- **Momentum and space control**:
  - Charges, sweeps, repositioning.
- **Judgment of the forest**:
  - Fight slightly changes based on the group’s previous behavior (optional later system).
- **Ward / Heartwood interplay**:
  - Standing stones can calm or enrage.

---

### 4.2 Baseline Attacks

Present across phases:

- **Gore Charge**
  - Long, telegraphed line charge.
  - Heavy damage, knocks players aside.
  - Leaves a **furrow** in the ground:
    - Slight terrain groove (slows or redirects movement).

- **Antler Sweep**
  - Short-range circular sweep.
  - Pushback around the Stag.

- **Hoof Stomp**
  - Local AoE stomp:
    - Mini shockwave,
    - May disturb nearby foliage or spawn “bramble spikes”.

- **Heartwood Snort**
  - Emits a wave of pollen / light:
    - Either minor buff to the Stag
    OR minor debuff to players (e.g., brief slow or blurry vision).

---

### 4.3 Phase 1 – The First Rush

**Trigger:** Fight start, HP 100% → ~70%

- The Stag is highly mobile, testing group positioning.

Mechanics:

- **Aggressive Charges**
  - Alternates Gore Charge with Antler Sweep.
  - Goes after:
    - Highest threat,
    - Players who stand near the Heartwood Tree too long.

- **Ground Furrows**
  - Each charge:
    - Leaves temporary grooves:
      - Slight slow,
      - Visual clutter.
  - If furrows cross:
    - Create **small bramble clusters** (extra obstacles).

- **Standing Stone Reaction**
  - If a player activates a nearby standing stone during this phase:
    - Short calming flare:
      - Reduces Stag damage for a brief window,
      - Also slightly reduces player damage to Stag.
  - Encourages learning stones as a **control** tool, not just a buff.

Goal:

- Teach:
  - Read telegraphs,
  - Manage arena space,
  - Use stones for control, not pure advantage.

---

### 4.4 Phase 2 – Heartwood Glow

**Trigger:** HP around 70% → ~35%

The Stag’s antlers and chest begin to **glow with Heartwood light**.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Heartwood Charge**
  - Charge lines now leave **glowing vein trails**:
    - Standing in them:
      - Slight damage,
      - But can be used to **activate** certain standing stones if crossed.

- **Heartwood Beam (Antler Burst)**
  - The Stag rears and fires a short sweeping beam of light between antler tips.
  - It:
    - Damages,
    - Temporarily “marks” the ground:
      - Marked zones become **calm patches**:
        - Reduced ambient damage over time,
        - But may draw focus of later attacks.

- **Forest Call (Adds)**
  - Summons 2–3:
    - Elite deer / smaller stags, or protective beasts.
  - They:
    - Charge, apply slows,
    - May attempt to **body block** players from Heartwood zones.

- **Stone Patterns**
  - If players activate **two specific stones in sequence**:
    - The Stag reacts:
      - Either:
        - Momentarily stunned (“calming pattern”), or
        - Goes into a short Enraged Rush if “wrong” pattern triggered.
  - This can be used to set up heart-burst windows.

Goal:

- Get players to:
  - Think about **patterns** on the stones,
  - Control the fight pace instead of only reacting.

---

### 4.5 Phase 3 – Judgment & Antler Shatter

**Trigger:** HP around ~35% → 0%

The Stag is wounded, fight turns more emotional and dangerous.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Judgment Roar**
  - On entering phase 3, the Stag roars:
    - Creates a **ring of pressure** expanding from the Heartwood Tree.
    - Players must:
      - Dodge gaps in the wave,
      - OR stand near specific lit stones to avoid it.

- **Fractured Antler**
  - As HP drops further:
    - One antler fractures (visually),
    - Pieces of **antler shard** embed in the ground:
      - These shards:
        - Hurt to step on,
        - But can be collected **after the fight** (trophy / reagent).

- **Rapid Charges**
  - Charges become shorter but more frequent.
  - If charges pass through too many calm Heartwood zones:
    - Stag begins to **overcharge**:
      - Gains damage and speed, but also takes extra damage temporarily.

- **“Mercy” Option (Optional Future Mechanic)**
  - If players **stop attacking** when Stag reaches very low HP and instead:
    - Activate all standing stones in a certain calm pattern:
      - The Stag might:
        - Flee instead of die,
        - Leaving behind some **non-lethal rewards** (rare reagents, different trophy).
  - For now, treat this as a possible future alt-resolution system.

Goal:

- Big, emotionally loaded finish:
  - You’re butchering a symbol of the forest.
  - Ideally, the fight feels like **a hard choice**, not a simple boss kill.

## 5. Specialty Mechanics & Drops

### 5.1 `spec_ingr_elder_stag_marrow`

**Mechanic:**

- First kill:
  - Guaranteed 1 x `spec_ingr_elder_stag_marrow` on the corpse.
- Later kills:
  - Drop chance linked to:
    - How **cleanly** the fight was executed:
      - Fewer environmental destruction,

**Mechanic (Conditional):**

- During phase 3, when **Fractured Antler** occurs:
  - Several antler shards stick into the ground.
- If players:

## 12. Implementation Notes (Future You)

This doc defines:

- The story, arena, phases, specialty mechanics,
- Who gets what and why.

In data/code, it ties to:

- B151 loot tables:
  - `gw_deer`, `gw_young_stag` families,
  - `gw_elder_stag` boss table with marrow & antler core.
- 51 / 55 ingredient and specialty definitions.
- 52 / 53 recipe grids (venison dishes, feasts).
- 57 trophy & feast projects.

When you eventually implement Elder Stag in game:

- Use B155 as checklist:
  - Arena built & matches vibe? ✔
  - Charges, stones, antler mechanics present? ✔
  - Drops align with ingredient IDs? ✔
  - Lodge trophies, food, and brews actually consume these reagents? ✔
