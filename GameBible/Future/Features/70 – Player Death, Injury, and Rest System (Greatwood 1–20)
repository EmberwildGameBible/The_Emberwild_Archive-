# 70 – Player Death, Injury, and Rest System (Greatwood 1–20)

## Purpose

Define how **dying, getting hurt, and recovering** works in Emberwild, especially in Greatwood 1–20:

- Death and respawn rules
- Injury / penalty model (if any)
- Resting at Lodge, camps, and in the field
- How food (52, 53), tonics (58), and profession loops tie into recovery

Goal: keep it **grounded and punishing enough to matter**, but not so harsh that it kills experimentation.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Consequences, not cruelty**  
   Dying should matter, but not delete hours of progress.

2. **Encourage preparedness**  
   Food, tonics, and gear matter more when death has some teeth.

3. **Lodge as safety anchor**  
   The Lodge should feel like a true home base for recovery and prep.

4. **Systems that scale later**  
   Greatwood 1–20 uses simpler versions of what can be deepened in later regions.

## Death Rules (Baseline)

### When HP Reaches 0

- Player is:
  - Knocked down / incapacitated briefly.
- If solo:
  - Timer runs, then player can:
    - Choose to “Struggle to Safety” (respawn at nearest safe point)
- If in group (future):
  - Allies have a short window to revive.

### Respawn Points

- **Primary:** The Lodge (default safe respawn).
- **Secondary:** Discovered outposts or camp locations.
- **Dungeon-Specific:** Entrance or recent checkpoint inside dungeons like Hollowroot Warren (65).

Respawn involves:

- Time cost (short load / fade)
- Travel cost (you’re physically somewhere else now)

---

## Penalties

Penalties should be meaningful but recoverable.

### Option: Soft Wound Debuff

On death, player gains a temporary “wound state”:

- **Mild version (Greatwood 1–20):**
  - Small debuff:
    - Slight reduction in max HP OR stamina regen
  - Duration:
    - Until player:
      - Rests at Lodge
      - Uses specific food or balm
- **Harder versions (later content):**
  - More complex injuries (broken arm, concussion-like penalties)

For Greatwood 1–20:

- Recommended: a **single unified debuff** such as:
  - “Shaken” or “Rattled”
  - -5% max HP, -5% stamina regen
  - Applied on death, stack limit 1–2

Removed by:

- Sleeping at Lodge beds
- Using a specific wound balm (58)
- Possibly certain high-tier foods or Ember Pot celebration event (56, 64)

---

## Rest and Recovery

### Lodge Rest

- **Full rest** at the Lodge:
  - Remove death debuff(s)
  - Restore HP/stamina pools fully
  - Maybe refresh some limited-use resources (where applicable later)

- Visual/audio:
  - Sleep, time passes
  - Lodge ambient sounds shift (e.g., wake up at a different time)

### Camp Rest

- Camps in the field:

- Provide:
  - HP/stamina restoration
  - Limited removal of minor penalties
- Do not fully clear:
  - Serious death debuffs (encourages returning to Lodge periodically)

Ties into:

- Combo structures (57), like Hanging Meat Rack or Scent-Masking Bundle.
- Forester/Woodworker structures that improve camp quality.

---

## Food, Tonics, and Injuries

Food (52, 53):

- Good food:
  - Mitigates attrition during prolonged play
  - Can provide:
    - Slight buffer against wound penalties
    - Comfort factor (small reduction of certain debuffs)

Tonics & Balms (58):

- Wound balms:
  - Clear specific minor injuries or reduce severity.
- Tonics:
  - Help recover from stamina loss or environmental strain.
- Strong brews:
  - Can mask problems in the short term (e.g. increased damage, but underlying penalties remain).

---

## Dungeon & Boss Death Integration

In dungeons (65) and world boss fights (66):

- Death loop:

  - If entire group wipes:
    - Respawn at:
      - Dungeon entrance
      - Or last activated checkpoint/camp
    - Possibly with:
      - One instance of the “Shaken” debuff

  - If solo:
    - Similar, but tuned so:
      - Attempts feel costly, not impossible to repeat.

- Optional dungeon-specific modifier:
  - “Depth Strain”:
    - Wounds acquired in Hollowroot may be harder to fix outside the Lodge.
    - Encourages returning after a few deaths.

---

## Tracking Player Risk

Not a UI meter, but design-side understanding:

- A player far from Lodge with:
  - Low food supply
  - No wound balms
  - No strong tonics

…is effectively “extended risk mode.”

Encourage this loop:

1. Prep at Lodge (food, tonics, etc.).
2. Dive into Greatwood:
   - Hunts, Deeds, dungeon, events.
3. Accrue:
   - Minor wounds
   - Spent supplies
4. Return to Lodge:
   - Cash in Hunts
   - Rest
   - Upgrade gear & professions
   - Refresh buffs and supplies

## Edge Cases & Grace

- **Falling off cliffs** or weird deaths:
  - Still apply standard death flow, but consider not stacking extra penalties for accidental terrain death repeatedly in Greatwood 1–20.

- **New players:**
  - First few deaths:
    - Might get a tutorial-like codex entry (69) explaining:
      - Lodge rest
      - Balms
      - Food utility

- **“Death loops”:**
  - Design to avoid:
    - Respawning in the middle of an unavoidable enemy pile.
    - Make sure respawn points are actually safe.

---

## Integration

- **Cooking System (52, 53, 56):**
  - Food as a softer, proactive protection against rough attempts.
- **Alchemy (58):**
  - Balms and tonics as direct tools for managing injury and fatigue.
- **Professions & Rep (54, 59):**
  - Higher-rank Cooks and Alchemists can offer better recovery options.
- **Events & Deeds (61, 62, 66):**
  - Some events may explicitly play with risk of death and recovery cost.
