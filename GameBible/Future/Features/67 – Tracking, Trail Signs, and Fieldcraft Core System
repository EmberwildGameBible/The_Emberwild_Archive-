# 67 – Tracking, Trail Signs, and Fieldcraft Core System

## Purpose

Design the **core tracking / fieldcraft system** that makes Emberwild feel like a true **hunting game**:

- Track beasts via visual + systemic clues
- Use **trail signs** (natural and player-made)
- Tie tracking into:
  - Hunts & Deeds (61, 66)
  - Forester / Hunter identity
  - Professions & combo items (57)
  - Events (62) and regions (63)

This spec defines mechanics, UI, readability, and progression.

## Design Goals

1. **Readable but not trivial**  
   Players should *learn* to read the forest, not just follow a glowing line.

2. **Multiple clue types**  
   Tracking uses:
   - Footprints
   - Broken branches, disturbed foliage
   - Blood, droppings, fur
   - Sound and ambient cues

3. **Scales with skill / gear**  
   Better tracking skill and gear = clearer clues, more options.

4. **Supports solo and group**  
   One player might lead, others follow; tracking can be a role.

## Core Tracking Concepts

### Sign Types

- **Footprints / tracks**
- **Broken vegetation** (trampled grass, broken branches)
- **Material traces** (blood, fur, droppings)
- **Sound cues** (distant calls, movement sounds)
- **Environmental markers** (scratch marks, gouged trees)

### Track Quality

Each clue/sign has:

- **Freshness:** fresh / recent / old
- **Clarity:** clear / partial / faint
- **Direction:** rough arrow of movement

Clarity and freshness are affected by:

- Time since the animal passed
- Weather (rain, wind, snow later)
- Terrain type (mud vs rock vs leaves)
- Player skill & gear (better perception = easier to notice / interpret)

## Player-Facing Mechanics

### Base Tracking (No Special Gear)

What every player can do:

- See **obvious tracks** (big prints, heavy blood) at close range.
- Inspect interactable signs:
  - “These tracks are fresh, heading southeast.”
- Follow a rough chain of clues to target.

Limitations:

- Fainter tracks may not show at all.
- No UI overlays for direction beyond short, simple hints.
- Easier to lose the trail in poor conditions.

---

### Tracking Skill & Progression

Tracking can be:

- A **subset** of a broader Hunter/Forester skill
- Or a dedicated “Tracking” skill (1–10, extendable)

Higher skill grants:

- Increased range at which tracks are visible
- Better clue detail:
  - Rough estimate of group size
  - Rarity of target
  - Whether target is injured or spooked
- Additional context barks:
  - “They’re moving faster now.”
  - “They doubled back recently.”

Skill can be improved by:

- Completing hunts/Deeds (61, 66)
- Using tracking in the field (following trails, successful kills)
- Profession quests (Forester-focused, 59)

---

### Trail Signs (Player-Made)

Players can create their own **trail signs** to:

- Mark paths
- Indicate danger or interest
- Communicate with other players (multiplayer future)

Examples:

1. **Cut Bark Marker**
   - Simple marking on a tree.
   - Craftable by Forester or any player with basic kit.
   - Visible on the world and possibly on mini-map as subtle icon.

2. **Ground Stack / Rock Pile**
   - Small cairn to mark direction
