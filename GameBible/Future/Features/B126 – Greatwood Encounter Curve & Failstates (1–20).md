# B126 – Greatwood Encounter Curve & Failstates (1–20)
1. Purpose

Define a clear, controlled difficulty curve for Greatwood levels 1–20, so that:

Encounters ramp in:

Complexity

Punishment

Mechanical demand

Players have:

Room to learn.

Space to fail safely.

Multiple ways to recover and re-engage.

This doc ties together:

Status/damage matrix (B125)

Itemization & roles (B124, B110)

Signature Hunts (B117–B121)

Contracts & pockets (B115–B116, B113)

It answers: “When is it okay for the game to actually be hard?” and “What happens when the player gets wrecked?”

2. Difficulty Philosophy (Greatwood)

Friction, not punishment, up to level ~10

Early Greatwood teaches:

Controls, basic combat, pocket flavors.

Failing:

Costs mostly time and minor resources.

Hard checks are earned, not random

True “skill checks” live:

In Signature Hunts.

Deeper pocket content.

Player should always be able to:

Do something else to get stronger.

Every spike is preceded by a lesson

If a Signature fight uses POISON heavily:

You’ve seen POISON in safer contexts first.

If an encounter uses SUPPRESSED:

Howler / Ward echoes taught it earlier.

Failure is feedback, not a wall

Death/failstates:

Push player toward:

Using gear/brews they’ve ignored.

Doing supporting contracts.

Not:

“You wiped, so the content is locked forever.”

Roles should all have honest “jobs”

No role should feel:

Useless in any major fight.

Difficulty curve must:

Support Striker, Warden, Scholar, Corruption-Edge, Woodsman equally.

3. Global Level Bands & Expectations

We chunk Greatwood difficulty into 4 bands:

Band I: 1–5 – Arrival & Basic Hunts

Band II: 6–10 – Pocket Identities & Early Tests

Band III: 11–15 – Specialist Challenges & Mid Hunts

Band IV: 16–20 – Signature Hunts & Wardstone Capstone

Each band defines:

Which pockets are baseline safe.

Which status types are allowed (B125).

How harsh failstates are.

4. Band I (1–5) – Arrival & Basic Hunts
4.1 Goals

Player should:

Learn:

Core combat.

Reading enemy telegraphs.

Very basic status (BLEED/POISON) and terrain.

Feel:

That Greatwood is dangerous but manageable with caution.

4.2 Allowed Pockets & Content

Primary pockets:

Ragged Verge (shallow) – Ridge wolves, boars.

Ember Run (very shallow) – just a taste of water hazards.

Greatwood Lodge & immediate surroundings – social, story, T1/T2/T3 contracts.

Enemies:

Ridge Wolves, basic beasts.

No brood, no sap, no ward constructs yet.

Statuses & damage (B125 aligned):

Physical only:

SLASH/PIERCE/BLUNT.

Light BLEED:

Only on some wolf/bite attacks.

No sustained POISON, CORRUPTION, SUPPRESSED yet.

SLOW:

Only very light, from terrain (mud, shallow water).

4.3 Encounter Types

1v1 tutorial fights:

Single wolf, single boar.

2–3 enemy packs:

Let player practice positioning/targeting.

No true elites:

At most, a slightly stronger Ridge wolf with a name.

4.4 Failstates & Recovery

If player dies / fails:

Resource loss:

Small:

A bit of durability.

Some consumables consumed on failed attempt.

Respawn:

At Lodge or nearest safe camp.

Guidance:

NPCs hint:

Try blocking.

Try using brews & food.

Maybe get a shield/weapon upgrade.

Band I design rule:

If a player wipes repeatedly to early content:

There should always be:

An obvious “do something else”:

Gather, craft better gear, do simpler contracts.

5. Band II (6–10) – Pocket Identities & Early Tests
5.1 Goals

Player should:

Recognize:

Each pocket has its own threat flavor.

Understand:

Basic statuses:

BLEED, POISON, SLOW, early SUPPRESSED.

Start:

Using brews/gear tailored to pocket.

5.2 Pocket Access & Relative Difficulty

Baseline “safe-ish” pockets (for level 6–10):

Ragged Verge mid-depth:

Bigger packs.

Hollowroot Fringe:

Edge of brood ecosystem.

Ember Run shallow:

More water hazards, but still forgiving.

“Handle with care” pockets (for mid-late 8–10):

Black Sap Grove fringe:

Light Corruption.

Wardstone Hill outskirts:

Minor ward anomalies.

5.3 Status & Damage Ramp (B125)

Ragged Verge:

Stronger BLEED.

KNOCKDOWN on some charges.

Hollowroot Fringe:

POISON introduced:

Weak at first; telegraphed via spore visuals.

Ember Run:

SLOW from wet surfaces.

Knockdowns from bad footing.

Black Sap Grove fringe:

Small CORRUPTION pools.

HCL builds slowly if you stand in them.

Wardstone outskirts:

Minor SUPPRESSED pulses if you stand too close to unstable ward stones.

No hard multi-status combos yet; usually:

One primary, one secondary mild effect at most per encounter.

5.4 “First Tests”

Introduce:

A few named elites per pocket:

Wolf Alpha in Verge.

Sporeburst Grub in Hollowroot Fringe.

Sap-Drip Beast near Grove fringe.

These should:

Punish ignoring their pocket’s identity.

But still be beatable with:

Basic gear.

Good play.

5.5 Failstates & Soft Walls

If player over-reaches (e.g., goes deep into Grove at level 6):

Encounters:

Hit hard but not instantly kill.

Death:

Comes after:

Several bad decisions, not one surprise.

Post-wipe:

NPC commentary:

“You went too deep for your gear. Try Hollowroot Fringe or more Verge work first.”

Systems:

Contract levels clearly indicated.

UI color-coded pocket difficulty.

Band II rule:

No “gotcha, now you’re dead” status gimmicks.

Over-reach should feel like:

“Yeah, that was on me”, not unfair.

6. Band III (11–15) – Specialist Challenges & Mid Hunts
6.1 Goals

Player should:

Have:

A clear role identity (B110).

Tier 2–3 gear (B124).

Be ready to:

Engage deeper pockets.

Face more complex CC/DoT combos.

This band sets up:

Hollowroot Matron, Greatwood Howler, Ragged King early phase, and Devourer prep.

6.2 Pockets & Expected Level

Ragged Verge deep (Ragged Clearing, Howler territory):

For 11–15.

Hollowroot Warren mid-depth:

For 11–15.

Black Sap Grove mid-depth:

For 12–15.

Wardstone Hill proper (R6-level anomalies):

For 12–15.

Ember Run mid:

For 10–14 (optional path).

6.3 Status & Complexity

Now allowed:

Two strong status types per pocket:

Hollowroot:

POISON + SLOW/ROOT.

Verge / Howler:

BLEED + SUPPRESSED + KNOCKDOWN in specific telegraphed moves.

Grove:

CORRUPTION_SICKNESS + SLOW; very minor extra TOXIC.

Wardstone:

SUPPRESSED + short STUN.

Ember Run:

SLOW + occasional BLEED + KNOCKDOWN.

Encounters:

Might now combine:

One DoT status + one movement/control status.

Example:

Brood pack:

POISON (grubs) + ROOT (fungal patches).

Ridge pack:

BLEED (bites) + KNOCKDOWN (charge).

6.4 Transitional Bosses & Elites

Non-Signature but serious fights:

Deep Warren Matriarch-Guard:

Tests anti-POISON gear.

Grove Resonant Husk:

Tests Corruption & HCL mitigation.

Ward Echo Major:

Tests reading Arcane telegraphs and SUPPRESSED.

These should:

Be tough but fair.

Reward:

Good use of brews.

Proper role synergy (Warden front, Striker focus fire, Scholar control, Edge leveraging Corruption, Woodsman flex).

6.5 Failstates & Progression Hooks

At this band, players may:

Hit real walls:

First attempts at Howler, Matron, deeper experiments in Grove/Hill.

When they fail:

Game should:

Present clear suggestions:

Try:

Specific contracts:

Get better Hollowroot antitoxins.

Get Wardstone guard gear.

Circle trials:

Gain new abilities/passives.

NPCs:

Provide targeted advice:

Aelric:

Talks about ward gear & brews for Grove/Shadow.

Isha:

Suggests antitoxins for Warren.

Ruarc:

Emphasizes gear & patience for Howler.

Band III rule:

A Signature Hunt shouldn’t be beatable “fresh” without:

At least some supporting content.

But:

It should be plausibly winnable with:

A bit of preparation and good play.

7. Band IV (16–20) – Signature Hunts & Wardstone Capstone
7.1 Goals

Pay off:

Everything the player has learned.

Deliver:

Fights that are genuinely challenging, but never unreadable.

Band IV includes:

Black-Sap Devourer (B117)

Hollowroot Matron (B118)

Greatwood Howler (B119) – for those who delayed, but ideally earlier

Ragged King Final (B120)

Shadow Under the Wardstone (B121)

Gloaming Vigil (B104/B116) as capstone event.

7.2 Expected Preparedness

By the time player engages these:

Gear:

At least Tier 3 leaning into specific pocket.

Access to some Tier 4 components (B124).

Brews:

Themed sets:

For POISON, CORRUPTION, Fear/SUPPRESSED, etc.

Role:

A clear role identity with some circle progression.

If they don’t:

Fights are doable but punishing; failstates will push them back to:

Do more prep.

7.3 Signature Fight Difficulty Targets

High-level intended feel:

Devourer:

Hard on:

Players who ignore Corruption & terrain.

Easier if:

They use wards, Veil, cleanse properly.

Matron:

Hard on:

Players who ignore POISON / swarm control.

Easier for:

Scholars & those with proper antitoxins, CC.

Howler:

Hard on:

Impatient players, poor stamina management.

Easier with:

Warden shields, bleed resist, good timing.

Ragged King:

Hard on:

Greedy players.

Easier for:

Those who respect patterns and choose a path (observe vs kill).

Shadow Under the Wardstone:

Hard on:

People who ignore ward glyph telegraphs & SUPPRESSED.

Easier if:

You’ve learned from Ward Echoes and use ward circles correctly.

7.4 Signature Failstates

When a player fails a Signature Hunt:

Immediate consequence:

Standard:

Death → respawn at Lodge or nearest safe point.

Some durability cost.

Some consumables lost.

Additional:

Unique:

Lodge reaction / story beats:

Howler kills:

Hunters whisper about “the Howler’s still out there.”

Matron wins:

Isha complains about brood wounds.

Devourer wins:

Grove continues to fester, small changes in random encounters.

Ward-Shadow wins:

Ward anomalies increase in Gloaming Vigil.

Importantly:

Nothing becomes unrecoverable from failures alone.

But:

The world reacts:

More tension, more urgent NPC lines.

Optional: If player fails a Signature multiple times in quick succession:

NPCs offer:

Optional “assist” toggles:

Extra Warden at Hill.

Temporary extra ward totem in Devourer fight.

Or, conversely, a “no assist / full purity” dialogue for players who refuse.

8. Onboarding Failstate Types

Common failure modes & planned responses:

“I keep dying to status X and don’t know why.”

Response:

Explicit status tooltips.

Infirmary/Alchemist dialogue:

“You’ve got brood poison / sap sickness – here’s what to bring next time.”

Minor pop-up once:

“POISON drains HP over time. Antitoxin brews, Hollowroot gear help.”

“I feel like I do no damage.”

Response:

Ruarc or gear NPC:

Comments on outdated gear.

Points player to contracts dropping Tier 2/3 weapons.

UI:

Recommended content listing:

“Try these Hunts/contracts to improve your gear.”

“I can’t track what’s happening in big fights.”

Response:

Animation clarity & color coding (B125).

Early training encounters:

Teach reading ground telegraphs before big AoEs appear.

Option:

In settings, allow “Enhanced Telegraphs” (larger indicators).

“I get stun-locked.”

Response:

Design guardrail:

No more than 1 strong STUN from non-boss enemies in sequence.

Warden/Scholar gear:

Provide anti-control passives for players who care.

9. System Hooks for Difficulty Smoothing

These systems help smooth spikes:

Resting Buffs

If the player fails a Signature Hunt:

Next rest at Lodge may grant:

Small buff:

e.g., +resistance vs that fight’s main status for 1 attempt.

Contract Suggestions

After a failure:

Huntboard can highlight:

2–3 contracts that drop gear/brews relevant to that Hunt.

Dynamic NPC Coaching

Specific failure triggers:

Howler → Ruarc & Lyss give more targeted advice.

Matron → Isha & Elgath.

Devourer & Shadow → Aelric & Neris.

Soft Level Gating

Hunts:

Have recommended level range.

If player is significantly under:

Extra warning:

“You can try, but this Hunt expects a seasoned hunter.”
