B123 – Lodge Gallery & Hall Evolution (Greatwood 1–20)
1. Purpose

Define how the Lodge as a whole visually and functionally evolves across the Greatwood 1–20 arc, so that:

The Great Hall, Ember Gallery, Warding Hall, Commons, and Huntboard area actively reflect:

Signature Hunts (B117–B121)

Contract packs (B115–B116)

Circles & identity axes (B105, B110)

Events (B104 – Ember Feast, Gloaming Vigil)

Projects & upgrades (B102)

When the player walks through the Lodge, they should see:

Evidence of Hunts completed.

How prepared (or fraying) the Lodge is.

Which circles are ascendant.

Echoes of key decisions (Ragged King, Wardstone Shadow, etc.).

This is the Lodge-wide decor & state spec, complementary to B122 (personal quarters decor).

2. Key Spaces & High-Level Behavior

We focus on these public / semi-public Lodge spaces:

Great Hall / Commons

Ember Gallery (trophy and story space; unlocked via B102)

Huntboard Nook & Hall

Warding Hall

Infirmary

Feast Hall State (Feast-ready vs aftermath)

Each space:

Has baseline appearance at Greatwood start.

Evolves:

With Projects (B102).

With Hunts and events.

With alignment/circle weight where appropriate.

We assume projects from B102 unlock tiers (e.g., “Gallery opened”, “Hall restored”) that allow certain decor layers to appear.

3. Great Hall / Commons

The Great Hall is:

The central “vibe check” of the Lodge.

Where:

Hunters pass through.

Dice games happen.

Informal storytelling and minor cutscenes fire.

3.1 Baseline State

At Greatwood start (before major projects):

Rough benches and tables.

Scarred central support beams.

One small Hearth (functional, but not grand).

Walls mostly bare wood, a few old tools.

Lighting:

Warm but modest.

A bit drafty in corners.

3.2 Project & Progress Layers

Tie to B102 projects:

Project: Patch the East Roof

Visual:

No more visible drips in one corner.

Buckets removed.

Occasionally:

NPCs remark that the hall “no longer rains indoors.”

Project: Reinforce Main Hearth

Visual:

Larger fire, stronger stone surround.

Hearth mantle supports later trophies.

Mechanical (optional):

Slightly better rest buff when you sleep after spending evening near hearth.

Project: Ember Gallery Opened (see section 4)

Adds:

Door / stair access from Hall into Gallery space.

Hall signage:

Modest carved plaque: “Ember Gallery”.

Project: Hunter Quarters Built (F1, B102)

Visual:

More traffic in/from a new hall.

Gear racks along walls where hunters leave equipment.

3.3 Public Trophy & Story Elements

Tie in Signature Hunts and Events:

Greatwood Howler Killed (B119):

A smaller Howler jawbone or stylized carving is mounted over the Hearth, below any personal skull mounts (B122 is for quarters, here it’s a communal echo).

Hunters sometimes:

Reference the jawbone when telling new hunters “what a real Hunt looks like.”

Black-Sap Devourer Killed (B117):

A chunk of hardened resin is installed near the Hearth or on a column:

It’s more abstract in the Hall than in quarters.

Occasional faint dark veins if the re-binding path (Aelric vs Neris) tilted more experimental.

Hollowroot Matron Killed (B118):

A chitin plate hung by the entry to the Hall or near the Gallery door.

Hunters occasionally slap it for “luck” when heading out into Warren Hunts.

Ragged King – Kill Path (B120):

A simple antler tine tied to a beam over the Hall entrance:

Not the full crown; that’s personal/quarters.

Symbol that “the King’s era is over.”

Ragged King – Spare Path:

Instead of bone:

A small inked panel showing stag tracks crossing the verge.

Quiet, easily missed but evocative.

Shadow Under the Wardstone – Rebind vs Destroy (B121):

Small etched stone:

Added to a side wall, bearing either:

A new, complex ward pattern (rebind).

A more traditional, sharp ward glyph (destroy).

Hunters argue over:

Which is “proper” when they notice.

3.4 Social & Event Layer

Events (B104) and Contracts (M1, M2, F1, F2, V-series) affect Hall props:

Dice & Tales (M1, F2):

Dice table props appear and get more elaborate:

At first:

Simple wooden cups, a few dice.

After repeated use:

Better carved cups, scoring board on wall.

Story sessions:

Use the Hall as backdrop for repeated micro-scenes.

Ember Feast (B104):

Feast-ready state:

Tables pushed together.

Extra lanterns, banners.

Visible meat and drink.

Post-Feast:

Hangover of crumbs, spare candles, and maybe new small art.

Gloaming Vigil:

On Vigil nights:

Hall lighting:

Lower, more watchful.

Quieter NPC chatter.

Some benches empty as watchers are out on Hill and bridges.

4. Ember Gallery

The Ember Gallery is a Lodge project (B102) that, once unlocked, becomes:

A space where:

Hunts are commemorated.

The Lodge canonizes its own history.

4.1 Baseline & Unlock

Before the project:

The Gallery is:

A dusty, underused side hall or upper room:

Crates.

Old tools.

A few outdated carvings.

After Project: Open Ember Gallery:

The room:

Cleared.

Lanterns hung.

Wall rails for plaques and displays.

4.2 Trophy Panels & Displays

Signature Hunts get Gallery panels once completed:

Greatwood Howler:

Panel: a carving of a wolf silhouette atop ridge trees.

Plaque text references:

Who led the Hunt.

How it ended (clean kill vs messy attempt).

Black-Sap Devourer:

Panel: swirling sap design and a carved beast eye.

If re-binding wards for Devourer support (SH-S2, Aelric path):

The panel’s border has more ward glyph motifs.

If Neris experimental path:

Subtle “unstable” flourishes in carving.

Hollowroot Matron:

Panel: stylized brood silhouette, fungal columns.

A note about:

Whether the eggs were mostly destroyed or partly preserved (“the nest shattered” vs “the nest thinned”).

Ragged King:

Two possible panels:

Kill: stag falling under a hunter’s shadow.

Spare: stag standing on a ridge, with a hunter watching from afar.

Only one panel appears per playthrough.

Shadow Under the Wardstone:

Panel: the Hill and Wardstone against night sky.

Details change:

Rebind: swirling, complex glyphwork carved.

Destroy: bold, simple ward lines.

4.3 Rotating Minor Displays

Smaller pedestals or shelves:

Show:

Items from important contracts/events:

Ember Feast tokens.

Vigil Lantern.

Special items from circle trials (HM1 / WD1 / SC1).

These can rotate based on:

Recent activities:

The game can pick:

2–3 “spotlight” items the player has unlocked and show those in the Gallery.

5. Huntboard Nook & Hall

The Huntboard area visually shows the hunting state of Greatwood.

5.1 Baseline

Large wooden board with pinned parchment.

A few small benches or stools nearby.

One lamp overhead.

5.2 State Changes

Tied to contract volume & player progress:

Early (Phase I, B115):

Board only partially filled:

Main Hunts.

Simple notices.

Some corners still bare.

Mid (Phase II–III):

More parchments pinned:

Visual sense of busy Lodge.

Stack of completed marks:

Basket of torn bounties or stamped tags.

Late (Phase IV):

Parts of board:

Have “closed” or “resolved” stamps.

Edges:

Show more specialized, complex contracts (Vigil, Ember Feast prep, Circle trials).

Signature Hunts:

Each, once taken:

Gets a distinct, stylized parchment at top or center of board.

Once completed:

That parchment:

Moves to a “Legend Marks” corner, or gets a red wax seal indicating completion.

5.3 NPC Presence

Huntmaster Ruarc and Lyss proximity & posture change with:

How many high-level Hunts are currently tagged.

Whether you’ve just turned in a Signature Hunt.

E.g., new voice lines triggered in the nook.

6. Warding Hall

The Warding Hall is the Lodge’s spiritual / technical heart for ward magic (B101, B109, B114).

6.1 Baseline

Simple ring of ward foci and diagrams.

Central table with old maps.

Aelric and apprentices working quietly.

6.2 Wardstone Shadow Outcomes

When Shadow Under the Wardstone is resolved (B121):

Rebind Path:

New:

Complex ward diagram hung prominently:

Mirrors “New Pattern Schema” in quarters (B122).

Some foci:

Show faint, occasional flickers or extra lines.

Aelric’s attitude:

Determined but uneasy. Occasional ambient lines about “watching the new pattern.”

Destroy Path:

More:

Clean, sharpened lines.

Some older diagrams:

Brought back from archives and re-hung.

Warden apprentices:

Slightly more confident in old doctrine.

6.3 Devourer & Grove Influence

If the Devourer Hunt (B117) is completed:

Warding Hall gets:

A pinned map showing:

Grove before and after you cut the Devourer down.

A small diagram:

On how wards now overlay Grove seep points.

If you pursued Neris-style experiments:

A small side table:

Shows sap samples with ward glyphs carved into the glassware.

Aelric comments:

On “using tainted roots to hold the tree.”

7. Infirmary

The Infirmary is where Medic Isha and others deal with wounds, toxins, and Corruption fallout.

7.1 Baseline

Sparse beds, basic shelves of herbs and bandages.

One curtained side for privacy.

7.2 Hollowroot & Poison Influence

After Matron is killed (B118) and sufficient Hollowroot contracts completed:

New:

Fungal and brood-derived tinctures on shelves.

Notes pinned about:

Symptoms and treatments of brood poison.

Isha’s lines:

Reference:

Fewer brood maulings.

Different “flavor” of poison after eggs are destroyed vs partly spared.

7.3 Corruption Load Visual

If player’s HCL has frequently been high:

Infirmary:

Shows more Corruption-treatment paraphernalia:

Blackened purging basins.

Extra ward-foci near beds.

After Devourer & Wardstone Shadow:

Infirmary gets:

A dedicated “corruption corner”:

Tools for dealing with residues from Grove and the wards.

Visual sign:

Greatwood has become a place where corruption is treated as routine, not exceptional.

8. Feast Hall State

The Feast Hall is either:

A separate space next to Great Hall, or

The Great Hall shifted into Feast mode.

Key states:

Preparation (driven by F1, M2, and Feast readiness meter).

Feast Live (B104).

Aftermath (post-Feast).

8.1 Preparation

As the Ember Feast meter fills:

Hall gradually shows:

Extra kegs.

Bundled herbs hanging from rafters.

Reserved tables with small markers.

NPC chatter:

Stove and Bran talk:

About “counting casks” and “lean winters vs fat ones.”

8.2 Feast Live

During Feast event:

Tables:

Packed.

Extra:

Lanterns, banners, musicians if budget allows.

Known Hunts:

Get called out:

Some trophies symbolically placed.

If great Hunts were done:

Extra decoration around their associated items.

8.3 Aftermath

After Feast:

For a time:

The Hall carries:

Spare banners.

Empty jugs.

Maybe a new carving commissioned after the stories told.

9. Dynamic Elements & Identity Reflection

The Lodge should not just be a static progression; it should display identity:

9.1 Circle Dominance Hints

Depending on which circle the player heavily favors:

Small shifts:

Huntmasters-weighted:

More weapon racks, target dummies visible.

Gallery panels emphasize big kills.

Wardens-weighted:

More ward diagrams in common spaces.

Posters about watch rotations, Vigil rosters.

Scholars-weighted:

More books and notes appear in Commons corners.

Gallery adds more written plaques and fewer just-images.

These are subtle overlays, not full reskins.

9.2 Merciful vs Ruthless Visual Hints

Some decor reacts to your choices:

Ragged King panel:

Immediately strong signal.

Infirmary and Warding Hall:

If you often choose extreme punishments (e.g. Wardstone rogue executed):

More severe mottos and warning inscriptions.

If you lean merciful:

Occasional “remembrance candle” corners, lists of names.

9.3 Cautious vs Reckless Tone

After repeated reckless play (lots of near-disasters, high casualties in Vigil, etc.):

Hall:

Shows more patched walls, scorched rafters, hastily nailed repairs.

NPCs:

Have more worried ambient chatter.

After careful, well-prepared play:

Lodge:

Looks tidier, fewer fresh patches, more orderly stacks of supplies.

10. Implementation Notes

Each space:

Uses layered states:

Baseline art + incremental overlays.

We avoid:

Full rebuilds per choice; we blend states.

Major Hooks:

Signature Hunts (B117–B121) → Gallery panels, subtle Hall/Gallery props.

Events (B104) → Feast/Vigil states.

Projects (B102) → Unlock spaces, structural upgrades.

Circles & Axes (B105, B110) → Flavor overlays and small prop swaps.

Player should never:

Have to dig through menus to notice this.

The Lodge passively “reads” like a memory palace of what happened in Greatwood.
