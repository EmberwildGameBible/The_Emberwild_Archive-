58 – Alchemy: Hunter Tonics, Balms, and Brews (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define a first-wave Alchemy system for Emberwild that:

Focuses on hunter-facing outputs: tonics, balms, and brews.

Uses the same ingredient taxonomy as Cooking and professions (51, 55, 95).

Lives next to food buffs, not on top of them.

Scales cleanly from Greatwood 1–20 with forward hooks into:

Corruption & cleansing (91)

Professions synergy & Lodge infrastructure (95)

Narrative & personal arcs (96)

This is a playable, shippable first pass, not just a vague stub. It should feel like a mini-profession that slots naturally into the early game loop:

Hunt → Gather ingredients → Brew → Rest / prepare → Return to the wild.

Design Pillars

Targeted, Tactical Power

Alchemy doesn’t give broad “+all stats forever” power.

It gives sharp, situational tools:

“I need to track this beast at night.”

“We’re going into a poison-heavy hollowroot burrow.”

“We’re pushing deeper into corruption; we need cleanses.”

Stacks With, Not Over, Cooking

Food = slow rhythm, long duration, broad buffs.

Alchemy = shorter bursts, emergency responses, specific counters.

Player should feel rewarded for having both:

Eat before you leave → cook buffs set your baseline.

Brew before (and during) the hunt → alchemy covers spikes and weird edge cases.

Low UI Surface, High World Texture

Small, grounded list of early recipes; no Diablo-style potion spam.

Most alchemy flavor comes from:

Ingredient names & sources.

Visuals and sounds of brewing.

Where you learn recipes in the world.

Expandable Framework

Core concepts should later support:

Weapon oils, poisons, and ammo coatings.

Bombs, flasks, and thrown tools.

Endgame Lodge infrastructure upgrades (95).

Scope & Boundaries (Greatwood 1–20)

In scope now:

One core profession track: Hunter Alchemy (can be merged into global “Alchemy” later).

3 major output categories:

Tonics – personal, drinkable buffs.

Balms – applied to body/armor, mostly mitigation and regeneration.

Brews – weird, utility-focused concoctions (vision, tracking, cleansing, etc.).

~12–18 early recipes, 6–8 of which are realistically usable in normal play loops.

Lodge + field brewing access:

Lodge alchemy table.

Portable field “still” / kit unlock later in the 1–20 track.

Explicitly out of scope for this block:

Full bomb/grenade system.

Dedicated poison / oil coating system for weapons.

Cross-region reagent economy beyond Greatwood 1–20.

Endgame professions “raiding consumable” meta.

All of that gets handled under advanced Alchemy & Professions synergy (95) and future B-series blocks.

System Positioning vs Cooking
Buff Categories

Food Buffs (Cooking, 52–57)

Duration: ~30–60 minutes.

Strength: moderate, multi-stat.

Identity: “I ate well before hunting; I’m prepared.”

Alchemy Buffs (this chapter)

Duration: ~5–20 minutes (or single-use / instant).

Strength: sharp, focused, reactive.

Identity: “I brewed tools to adapt mid-hunt.”

Stacking Rules

A hunter may have:

1 food buff active at a time.

1 tonic active (personal drink).

1 balm active (applied effect).

Any number of instant brews used (cleanses, short-lived effects), but with shared cooldowns.

So in the UI, you see three persistent buff slots:

Plate icon (Food) • Flask icon (Tonic) • Bandage icon (Balm)

Brews mostly sit as instant-use items with cooldowns.

Core Loop

Gather

Harvest herbs, fungi, monster fluids, and mineral salts from Greatwood.

Gather nodes hook into:

Profession nodes (Forester, Herbalist) (6, 51, 95).

Monster-specific drops (55, 79, 80).

Corrupted nodes in late Greatwood (91).

Brew

Use an Alchemy Station:

Lodge infirmary alcove.

Field camp portable kit (mid-1–20).

Select recipe → confirm ingredients → brew with a short animation.

Output is 1–3 charges depending on recipe and Alchemy skill.

Use

Assign tonics/balms/brews to quick slots.

Drink / apply / throw in combat or camp.

Gain buff(s), sometimes with side effects.

Refine & Progress

Level Alchemy by:

Brewing new recipes.

Successfully using them in hunts / quests.

Higher skill:

Improves yield.

Reduces side effects.

Unlocks advanced variations of familiar recipes.

Ingredients & Reagents

Alchemy leans on existing taxonomy (51, 55), with a thin extra layer of reagents.

Base Categories

Herbs & Fungi

herb_paleleaf, herb_sparkbloom, fungus_hollowcap, etc.

Rivers, glades, corruption edges.

Crafting Flow & UI

Interact with Alchemy Station (Lodge or field kit).

UI opens with the following tabs:

Tonics

Balms

Brews

(Later: “Advanced” tab for bombs/oils).

Name & tier.

Short fantasy description.

Ingredients.

Effect + Duration.

Side effect (if any).

Minimum Alchemy skill required.

Brew action:

Choose batch size (if you have ingredients).

Quick brew bar (~3–5 seconds).

Chance for “Overbrew” (extra charge) at high skill.

Progression & Skill
Skill Ranks (Greatwood Slice)

Rank 1–25: Apprentice

Lodge training, basic tonics and balms.

Failure chance on more complex recipes.

Rank 26–50: Adept

Access to corruption-related brews and specialized hunts tonics.

Recipes tied to Hollowroot Warren and late-Greatwood quests.

Gaining Skill

Brew any recipe (small exp).

Brew a recipe for the first time (bonus exp).

Complete Alchemy-related Lodge tasks:

Supply small batches of tonics for hunts.

Support NPC expeditions (mini-quests).

Buff Logic & Scaling
Baseline Tuning (Greatwood 1–20)

Tier 1 tonic:

~10–20% improvement in a focused stat or regen.

10–15 minutes duration.

Tier 2 tonic:

~20–30% improvement, 15–20 minutes duration.

Often includes mild side effects or conditional downsides.

Simple Scaling Model

Each recipe has:

Base Potency P_base

Alchemy Skill Modifier P_skill

Player Level Modifier P_level (light)

Example formula:

Effective Potency = P_base × (1 + AlchemySkill / 200) × (0.8 + PlayerLevel / 50)

This keeps early recipes relevant a bit longer without letting them scale infinitely.

World Integration
NPCs & Stations

Lodge Infirmary

Primary Alchemy station in early Greatwood.

Staffed by:

One stern medic (teaches safety).

One slightly unhinged experimental alchemist (unlocks corruption recipes).

Field Kits

Later in 1–20, players unlock a Portable Still:

Limited set of recipes.

Reduced batch size.

Requires fuel (e.g. camp_fuel).

Quest Hooks

“Bitter Medicine”

Deliver tonics to a wounded hunting party.

Teaches Emberheart / Cleansebrew basics.

“Smoke in the Roots”

Track and cure a corrupted beast using Purge of the Glade.

Teases deeper corruption mechanics.

“Three Sips for the Road”

Learn three simple brews that each help a different type of hunt:

Tracking.

Mobility.

Defense.

Lodge Economy & Professions Synergy (95)

Alchemy provides:

Supply contracts: Lodge posts small orders for tonics before big hunts.

Profession bundles:

Forester brings special barks & resins.

Hunter brings essences.

Alchemist combines them into hunt-ready kits.

This ties into:

Lodge reputation tracks (59, 95).

Future infrastructure upgrades:

Expanded infirmary.

Additional Alchemy stations near training grounds.

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

These are not implemented in the 1–20 slice but the framework prepares for them:

Weapon Oils & Poisons

Temporary coatings that add special on-hit effects.

Thrown Flasks / Bombs

Area denial, soft CC, and elemental zones.

Advanced Corruption Alchemy

Dangerous brews that trade sanity / health for huge power spikes.

Regional Flavors

Shattercoast, highlands, and other zones get unique reagents and signature brews.

All future Alchemy work should extend this foundation, not replace it: tonics, balms, and brews remain the core hunter toolkit, with advanced stuff layered on top.
