# 58 – Alchemy Stub: Hunter Tonics, Balms, and Brews

## Purpose

Lay out a **first-wave Alchemy concept** focused on hunters in Greatwood:

- Simple **tonics**, **balms**, and **brews** that complement Cooking
- Use the same ingredient taxonomy (51) where possible
- Live comfortably next to food buffs (not replace them)

This is a **stub/spec** to guide future Alchemy work, not a full system implementation.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Differentiate from Cooking**  
   - Cooking = more about **sustained buffs** and identity (meals, feasts)
   - Alchemy = more about **targeted, sharper effects** (shorter duration, more specific)

2. **Keep it hunter-themed**  
   Tonics and balms should help with:
   - Wounds
   - Stamina/fatigue
   - Tracking and perception
   - Resistances (corruption, poison, cold, fire)

3. **Low complexity at start**  
   Start with a handful (10–15) of recipes that are easy to understand and use.

4. **Room to scale**  
   Leave space for higher-tier, weirder stuff later (venoms, heavy poisons, transformation brews, etc.).

## Alchemy Item Types

### 1. Tonics

Drinkable liquids with **short-to-medium duration buffs**.

Examples:

- Stamina tonics
- Focus / perception tonics
- Resistance tonics (cold, fire, corruption)

### 2. Balms

Applied to skin or gear; usually **defensive or restorative**.

Examples:

- Wound balms
- Anti-venom salves
- Frostbite protection ointments

### 3. Brews

“Experimental” concoctions; can be stronger with **side effects**.

Examples:

- Berserker brew
- Night sight brew
- “Heartsteel” brew (defensive, heavy drawback)

- **Required Alchemy Skill:** (rough early range: 1–10)
- **Ingredients:** using IDs from 51 where possible
- **Effect:** mechanical summary

## System Hooks

- Alchemy should use:
  - **Stations:** small alchemy tables in Lodge, outposts, and eventually player camps
  - **Skill track:** Alchemy 1–10 stub, extensible later
- Recipes learned via:
  - Trainers
  - Quest rewards
  - Recipe drops in relevant dungeons/events

---

## Relationship to Cooking

- Cooking:
  - Longer duration buffs
  - Fits “meal before the hunt” and social identity
- Alchemy:
  - Shorter-term, punchy effects
  - “Emergency tools” and targeted boosts

A player should feel rewarded for **having both**, not forced to choose one.

---

## Next Actions

- Finalize the early recipe list and map them to specific ingredients (51, 55).
- Decide where Alchemy stations exist in Greatwood.
- Integrate early Alchemy training into:
  - Lodge medic / specialist NPCs
  - Dungeon/world questlines
