# B156 – Ward-Bear – Full Hunt Integration (Greatwood 1–20)

## 0. Purpose

Define the **Ward-Bear** Hunt as a fully integrated system node:

- Fantasy, story role, and unlock flow
- Arena layout and encounter phases
- Profession roles (Hunter, Cook, Alchemist, Forager/Woodworker)
- Core + specialty drops (51 / 55)
- Loot behavior aligned with B151
- Lodge projects, trophies, and ward rituals (57)
- Food and brew hooks (52, 53, 58)

This file is the authoritative reference for Ward-Bear so you do not have to flip between multiple docs to remember why it matters.

## 1. Role in Greatwood

**Name:** Ward-Bear  
**Region:** Greatwood outskirts of Wardstone Hill and nearby ravines  
**Band:** Mid–late Greatwood (recommended 14–20)  
**Type:** Signature Hunt – defensive / ward-aligned guardian

### 1.1 Narrative Identity

The Ward-Bear is:

- A massive, scarred bear that has lived near **Wardstone Hill** for decades.
- Its hide is thick with **ward glyph scars** and faintly glowing claw-marks.
- It acts as a semi-wild **guardian of the wardlines**:
  - Drawn to failing wards and corrupted intrusions,
  - Crushing anything that feels like a threat.

It is not purely “good” or “evil”:

- When wards are stable:
  - It keeps predators and stray corruption at bay.
- When wards weaken:
  - It becomes frantic, over-aggressive, sometimes attacking caravans and outposts.

Mechanically and thematically it owns:

- Heavy defensive meat:
  - `ward_bear_haunch` (51)
- Specialty reagents:
  - `spec_ingr_ward_bear_gelatin`
  - `spec_ingr_ward_bear_spine_shard`
  - `spec_ingr_old_warden_clot` (55)
- Defensive food and brews:
  - Physical damage reduction, knockback resistance, stability (52, 53, 58)
- Lodge/ward content:
  - Guardian totem, ward rituals (57)

It is the “defensive sibling” to Elder Stag (vitality/balance) and a stabilizing presence against Hollowroot/Black-Sap threats.

---

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Recommended Placement

Ward-Bear should feel like:

- The Hunt you do when **Wardstone trouble** starts becoming obvious.
- A key step in understanding how:
  - Physical threats,
  - Wardstone failures,
  - And ritual defense all intersect.

Suggested rough order:

- Player has:
  - Visited Wardstone Hill (basic ward tutorial).
  - Encountered some corruption events (Hollowroot pockets, minor Black-Sap).
  - Completed at least one earlier Hunt (Elder Stag or Howler).

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **“The Hill Roars”**
   - Contract:
     - Merchants and scouts report a huge bear near Wardstone Hill.
     - It smashed a caravan that “smelled wrong”.
   - Player:
     - Investigates wreckage,
     - Finds claw-marks that glow faintly where they struck ward-attuned materials.

2. **Warden Consultation**
   - Ward NPC:
     - Identifies tracks as belonging to an old guardian-bear that:
       - Has lived near the Hill longer than any current Warden.
     - Worries that something has driven it into a frenzy.

3. **Patrols and Proof**
   - Player:
     - Patrols three zones around Wardstone Hill.
     - Fights:
       - Corrupted beasts,
       - Possibly a minor Hollowroot intrusion.
     - Finds signs that the Bear is:
       - Attacking corruption,
       - But also slamming into ward pillars and supply caches.

4. **Hunt Posting – “Ward-Bear”**
   - Board unlocks named Hunt:
     - “The old guardian has turned. Either calm it, or end it, before Hill and Lodge both fall.”

5. **Aftermath**
   - Depending on success:
     - Ward NPCs acknowledge:
       - Wards are safer for now.
     - New ward rituals and defensive projects become available.

---

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Layout

Arena is a **rocky ravine / hillside** near Wardstone Hill:

- Stepped terrain:
  - Sloped approach,
  - Flat-ish central fighting space,
  - Some high ledges and low pits.
- Ward elements:
  - Half-buried wardstone shards,
  - Old Warden camp remains,
  - A cracked ward pillar at the far end.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **Central Fighting Ground**
  - Main area where Ward-Bear engages.
  - Moderate room for kiting, but not wide open.

- **Wardstone Shards**
  - Small standing fragments around edges.
  - Interactable:
    - Can be **triggered** to:
      - Emit short ward pulses,
      - Slightly weaken or stagger the Bear,
      - Create momentary “ward fields” (reduced damage zones).

- **Falling Debris Zones**
  - Overhangs and loose rocks.
  - Bear’s slams and roars can:
    - Dislodge rocks,
    - Create dangerous patches if fight drags on.

---

## 4. Boss: Ward-Bear – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Beast / Ward-attuned Guardian  
**Fight Length Target:** ~4–7 minutes

Core themes:

- Heavy physical damage,
- Ground control and knockback,
- Interaction with ward pulses and terrain.

---

### 4.1 Baseline Attacks

Used across phases, tuned per phase:

- **Maul**
  - Close-range, heavy swipe combo.
  - High damage, can knock a single target down if repeated.

- **Shoulder Rush**
  - Short, brutal charge.
  - Sends target sliding across ground.
  - If target collides with terrain:
    - Bonus damage / short stun.

- **Ground Slam**
  - Front or 360-degree slam.
  - Creates fissures or shockwaves in a radial pattern.

- **Ward-Bellow**
  - Roar that:
    - Applies a “rattle” debuff (minor stagger / aim shake).
    - Interacts with ward shards (could charge or destabilize them).

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 – The Guardian Tests

**Trigger:** Fight start, HP 100% → ~70%

- Bear tests the group’s ability to:
  - Handle basic knockbacks and positioning.
  - Use or ignore ward shards intelligently.

Mechanics:

- **Simple Rushes and Mauls**
  - Focus on the highest threat or nearest target.
  - Push players around central ground.

- **Controlled Ground Slams**
  - Creates cracks in ground:
    - Minor slow zones.
  - Too many cracks stacked:
    - Start to cause small periodic damage.

- **Ward Pulse Interaction (Intro)**
  - If players activate a nearby ward shard:
    - Short protective field:
      - Reduced damage taken inside.
    - Bear responds:
      - Either avoids it briefly,
      - Or tries to smash the shard if fight drags.

Goal:

- Establish the “feel”:
  - Heavy but readable,
  - Arena is not static.

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 – Wards and Wrath

**Trigger:** HP around ~70% → ~35%

The Bear becomes more aggressive, and ward interactions deepen.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Enraged Shoulder Rush**
  - Longer rush,
  - Can hit multiple players in a line,
  - Potentially knocks them into debris zones or off ledges.

- **Fracture Slam**
  - Variant of Ground Slam:
    - Targets a ward shard directly.
    - If it hits:
      - Shard shatters,
      - Sends ward-energy shockwave:
        - Damages players,
        - Leaves behind a small field of static energy.

- **Ward Resonance**
  - If players chain-activate shards in a specific pattern:
    - Temporary:
      - Stronger ward field,
      - Bear is briefly weakened defensively (less armor).
  - If shards are activated randomly:
    - Less benefit; risk of destabilizing them.

- **Rubble Hazards**
  - Each slam near cliffs:
    - Chance to drop rocks.
    - Creates:
      - Line-of-sight blockers,
      - Small danger zones.

Goal:

- Push players to coordinate:
  - How and when shards are used,
  - Where they want the Bear to slam.

---

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Last Stand

**Trigger:** HP around ~35% → 0%

The Bear’s fur bristles, old ward scars glow, and it goes into a desperate last stand.

New/amped mechanics:

- **Guardian’s Rage**
  - Short window buff:
    - Increased damage and speed.
  - Triggered:
    - Periodically,
    - Or when shards are destroyed.

- **Spinequake**
  - A more powerful slam:
    - Bear rears and slams both forepaws down.
    - Sends a pulse through the ground:
      - Knock-up or heavy stagger in a wide radius.
    - Stronger if:
      - Many shards are shattered,
      - Or wardlines are unstable.

- **Defensive Crouch**
  - At very low HP:
    - Bear temporarily adopts a defensive posture:
      - High damage reduction.
    - Each active ward shard:
      - Can be used by players to channel a ward pulse:
        - Stripping stacks of defensive buff if timed correctly.

Goal:

- Make the last 30% feel like a serious defensive check:
  - Greedy players ignoring shards will die.
  - Parties that use wards smartly will outlast it.

## 12. Implementation Notes (Future You)

In the Game Bible:

- B156 is the integration map for Ward-Bear.

In data / code:

- Ties directly to:
  - B151 creature loot for `gw_ward_bear` (if defined as a specific ID).
  - 51 / 55 ingredients and specialties.
  - 57 projects:
    - Guardian Totem,
    - Ward rituals,
    - Optional Lodge decor.
  - 52 / 53 / 58 for:
    - Defensive dishes and brews.

When you eventually build Ward-Bear:

- Use B156 as your checklist:

  - Arena matches ravine/wardstone vibe.
  - Phases and slam/ward mechanics exist.
  - Drops actually give haunch/gelatin/spine/clot.
  - Lodge projects and ward rituals consume those reagents meaningfully.
