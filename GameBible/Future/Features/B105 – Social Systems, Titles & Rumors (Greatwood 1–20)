B105 – Social Systems, Titles & Rumors (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define how social perception of the hunter works in the Greatwood 1–20 slice:

What the Lodge and wider Emberwild call you (titles, nicknames).

How your reputation and actions turn into:

Spoken lines.

Reactions.

Rumors.

How this ties into:

Lodge circles & rep (59)

Hunts & Signature Hunts (61, B103)

Corruption & Warding (91, B101)

Lodge Projects & Events (B102, B104)

Personal quarters & identity (B100)

This is not just a cosmetic layer; it is the social feedback loop for everything you are doing.

Design Pillars

Names Mean Something

Titles and nicknames are earned, not just toggled.

NPCs use them in:

Greeting lines.

Gossip.

Contracts and ceremonies.

Social Systems Are Lightly Mechanical, Heavily Thematic

You gain:

Small perks (shop discounts, contract options, event variants).

But the main payoff is:

Feeling recognized.

Seeing the world talk about you differently.

Reputation Has a Shape, Not a Score Only

Reputation is not only numbers.

It has flavors:

“By-the-book Warden ally.”

“Reckless experimenter.”

“Quiet tracker who observes more than kills.”

Rumors Travel

Events, Hunts, and choices cause:

Rumors to appear in Lodge and field.

Sometimes rumors are:

Right.

Wrong.

Half-right in interesting ways.

Expandable Without Rework

B105 is the core social fabric.

Later regions, Lodges, and factions plug into this:

Add their own titles, rumor pools, social axes.

Keep the same underlying logic.

Core Concepts

We define five primary components:

Lodge Rank Titles – formal status, tied to 59.

Circle Epithets – flavored tags per Lodge circle.

Deeds & Social Axes – hidden traits from actions.

Rumor Network – how NPC gossip reflects your deeds.

Presentation & Feedback – what the player actually sees/hears.

1. Lodge Rank Titles (Formal Status)

These are the formal titles the Lodge uses for you, mostly controlled by:

Lodge Proper rank (59).

Major story milestones in Greatwood.

They reflect your overall place in the Lodge hierarchy, not your personal style.

Greatwood Lodge Rank Titles

For 1–20, we define a simple progression:

“Guest of the Lodge” – Rank 0

“Pledged Hunter” – Rank 1

“Bound Hunter” – Rank 2

“Sworn Ember” – Rank 3

Rank 4+ titles exist but are beyond Greatwood.

Rank 0 – Guest of the Lodge

When:

You first arrive.

How NPCs reference you:

“The newcomer.”

“Guest.”

Rarely by anything more specific.

Mechanics:

Limited access:

Some rooms locked.

Some contracts not shown.

No formal privileges.

Rank 1 – Pledged Hunter

When:

You complete the Lodge’s initial trial/intro Hunts.

How NPCs reference you:

“Pledged.”

“One of ours now.”

Mechanics:

Basic access:

Standard Hunt Board unlocked.

Entry-level projects and events visible (B102, B104).

UI:

Lodge UI can show title “Pledged Hunter” in character panel.

Rank 2 – Bound Hunter

When:

Sufficient Lodge Proper rep + key story beat (e.g., first Signature Hunt success).

How NPCs reference you:

“Bound Hunter.”

“Bound to the Lodge.”

Some older hunters:

“The young Bound,” etc.

Mechanics:

Unlocks:

Additional contract slot via B102 (“Hunt Board Annex”).

Some mid-tier Lodge Projects (B102).

Access to partially opened Restricted Lab (B101).

Events:

You are formally included in things like Hunt Reckoning and Ember Feast ceremonies (B104).

Rank 3 – Sworn Ember

When:

High Lodge Proper rep + major story arc completion (e.g., two or more Signature Hunts, at least one corruption storyline resolved).

How NPCs reference you:

“Sworn Ember.”

“One of the Sworn.”

Mechanics:

You are treated as:

A key hunter in Greatwood.

Unlocks:

Late Greatwood projects (B102).

Highest “trusted” level access in Warding Wing for this slice (B101).

Events:

During Ember Feast or Vigil, you may be asked:

To give a short ceremonial line.

Or to stand at the front of the hall.

These titles are global for the Lodge: most NPCs, boards, and official documents use them.

2. Circle Epithets (Reputation Flavors)

Circle Epithets are additional labels that reflect your standing within a specific Lodge circle:

Huntmasters’ Circle

Wardens’ Circle

Scholars’ Circle

They are informal but respectful; they appear in:

Voice lines.

Notes on contracts.

Occasional UI ribbons.

Think of them as “how these people talk about you internally.”

Huntmasters’ Epithets (Examples)

Unlocked based on:

Number and type of Hunts completed.

Ratio of clean kills vs brutal, collateral-heavy Hunts.

Willingness to take high-risk contracts.

Possible early epithets:

“Surehand”

Clean, efficient kills.

Rarely fails or abandons Hunts.

“Storm-Blood”

Takes risky, high-difficulty Hunts.

High down/death count but keeps coming back.

“Pack-Keeper”

Often hunts in groups.

High success on group Hunts.

These don’t replace formal title:

An NPC might say:

“Sworn Ember, Surehand of the Huntmasters.”

Wardens’ Epithets (Examples)

Tied to:

Participation in Warding projects.

Success/failure in corruption Hunts.

Behavior during Vigil.

Possible early epithets:

“Stonebound”

Consistent helper in ward maintenance.

Rarely ignores corruption contracts.

“Edge-Walker”

Spends long time in high-ZCL zones.

Maintains high HCL but manages not to break.

“Reluctant Warden”

Minimally engages Wardens tasks.

Helps only when story or obligation pushes.

Scholars’ Epithets (Examples)

Tied to:

Research contributions.

Attitude toward experimentation and knowledge.

Behavior in Scholar events.

Possible early epithets:

“Field-Quill”

Diligent about lore/Bestiary tasks.

Brings back good samples and notes.

“Specimen-Breaker”

Frequently kills creatures before study is complete.

Might ignore “observe only” contracts like Ragged King.

“Curious Flame”

Engages with experimental projects.

Supports more dangerous lab work.

These epithets can change over time:

If behavior shifts significantly, a different epithet can override the old one.

Mechanically, epithets are mostly flavor, but can:

Lightly modify:

Contract options offered.

Dialogue branches.

Prices for certain circle services.

3. Deeds & Social Axes (Hidden Traits)

Beyond rep numbers, we track qualitative axes based on what the player actually does.

These are not shown directly in UI (at least in 1–20), but drive:

Rumors.

NPC tone.

Specific triggers.

Example Axes for Greatwood

Merciful vs Ruthless

Merciful:

Spares creatures or humanoids when given the option.

Chooses observation over killing (e.g., Ragged King).

Ruthless:

Takes kill options even when non-lethal solutions exist.

Causes collateral damage (e.g., kills non-hostile deer during that Hunt).

Cautious vs Reckless

Cautious:

Takes time to prepare (food, alchemy).

Low death count.

Often cleanses before ZCL spikes.

Reckless:

Frequently pushes into high ZCL long past safe HCL.

Multiple downed states in Hunts.

Might trigger more “Infirmary Rush” events.

Lodge-Faithful vs Fringe-Aligned

Lodge-Faithful:

Sides with Warden of Wards and Lodge leadership on controversial choices (e.g., Shadow Under the Wardstone).

Rejects risky experiments.

Fringe-Aligned:

Frequently sides with Fringe Alchemist ideas.

Protects or covers experimental knowledge, even against orders.

Solitary vs Pack-Led

Solitary:

Usually goes out alone (if game supports multi-hunter context, even fictionally).

Accepts solo Hunts often.

Pack-Led:

Frequently forms or is described with group Hunts.

Socially active in Lodge.

Each axis is soft, not min/max:

You don’t get hard-locked into a label.

But NPCs and rumors lean toward reflecting your track record.

4. Rumor Network

The Rumor Network is the system that turns:

Titles.

Epithets.

Deeds/axes.

Notable events (Signature Hunts, Festivals, Projects)

into gossip and reactive ambient lines.

Rumor Sources

Lodge Interior

Common room.

Hallways.

Infirmary.

Labs & Warding Wing.

Greatwood Field NPCs

Hunters at camps.

Villagers.

Foresters / gatherers.

Boards & Notes

Marginalia on:

Hunt Board.

Lodge Project Board.

Research Ledger notes.

Rumors often exist as:

Short, reusable lines, with substitutable bits:

“[Title] really did [deed]?”

“They say the Sworn Ember fought the Devourer knee-deep in sap.”

Rumor Categories

Hunt Rumors

Triggered by:

Completing Signature Hunts (B103).

Failing them repeatedly.

Examples:

“They say the Howler finally fell to a Bound Hunter who refused to retreat.”

“The Matron’s brood still scratches at the walls in their sleep.”

Corruption Rumors

Triggered by:

Corruption events and Vigil.

Warding projects completed/failed.

Examples:

“The wards flickered last night. I heard someone say the Shadow was back.”

“Black Sap Grove is quieter today. Must be some big kill.”

Personality Rumors (Axes)

Triggered by:

Repeated behavior on axes (merciful/ruthless, etc).

Examples:

Merciful:

“They say you watched the stag and never nocked an arrow. Spirits will remember that.”

Ruthless:

“Careful. That one doesn’t leave much breathing if there’s a bounty posted.”

Festival & Event Rumors

Triggered by:

Ember Feast participation.

Gloaming Vigil choices.

Examples:

“You should have heard them at the Feast, telling the tale of the Devourer.”

“Did you see who stood the whole Vigil without sitting once? Stonebound indeed.”

Project Rumors

Triggered by:

B102 projects.

Examples:

“The roof finally got fixed. They say [Title] paid half the timber themselves.”

“With the wards extended to Hollowroot, maybe we’ll actually sleep.”

Truthiness and Misinformation

Rumors are not always perfectly accurate:

A rumor might:

Get the monster right but the details wrong.

Attribute your deeds to “one of the Bound” before you’re formally named.

Occasionally:

You hear a rumor about yourself that is wrong:

This can seed future quest hooks (e.g., you are thought to have killed something you did not, or spared something you didn’t).

5. Presentation & Player Feedback

The social systems must be visible enough that:

Players understand they’re being recognized.

But not so UI-heavy that it feels like spreadsheets.

Where Titles/Epithets Show

Dialogue UI

NPC name subtitle could include:

“Warden of Wards”

When they address you:

“Sworn Ember” / “Bound Hunter” / “Pledged” etc.

Character Sheet

Simple section:

Formal Lodge Title: “Bound Hunter”

Optional “Known Epithets” list:

“Surehand” – Huntmasters

“Field-Quill” – Scholars

Hunt Board / Project Board UIs

Some contracts may:

Call you out by title.

Show circle icons that line up with epithets.

Quarters (B100)

Room might:

Display title on a plaque.

Eventually show epithets on trinkets, notes, or gifts left by NPCs.

Where Rumors Show

Ambient Dialogue

Overheard lines when walking by groups.
２. Interactable Chatter

Press interact near a gossiping pair:

They share a short rumor and use your name/title.

Written Notes

Occasionally:

Scribbled comments on boards.

Letters that mention “that Sworn Ember who…” etc.

Small Mechanical Perks (Greatwood Slice)

These social systems should lightly reward certain paths without forcing them.

Examples:

Certain epithets may:

Reduce prices at circle-linked vendors (e.g., “Surehand” gets small discount on Huntmasters gear).

Increase chance of being offered specific contract types (e.g., “Field-Quill” gets more exploration/research contracts).

Certain rumor-driven flags:

Might open up optional dialogue:

Someone hearing you spared the Ragged King might send you to a spirit-related side quest later.

Being known as ruthless may open up darker-leaning contract pitches.

Certain titles and event participation:

May slightly alter base rep gain bands:

“Sworn Ember” after a strong Vigil might get +X% Wardens rep for a short while.

The idea is subtle but persistent: playing a certain way feels supported and seen.

Example Player Social Journeys (Greatwood)

To show how this all ties together, a few “archetype paths”:

A. The Lodge-Faithful Warden

Behavior:

Always prioritizes corruption contracts.

Strong participation in Vigil.

Sides with Warden of Wards in “Shadow Under the Wardstone”.

Result:

Formal title: Sworn Ember.

Epithets:

Wardens: Stonebound.

Scholars: Maybe Specimen-Breaker (too willing to kill corrupted samples).

Axes:

Lodge-Faithful, Cautious.

Rumors:

“Stonebound stood all Vigil.”

“If the wards hold, it’s because of them.”

B. The Reckless Experimentalist

Behavior:

Often pushes high ZCL.

Deals with Fringe Alchemist often.

Supports experimental corruption projects.

Result:

Formal: Bound Hunter (maybe slower to become Sworn).

Epithets:

Huntmasters: Storm-Blood.

Scholars: Curious Flame.

Axes:

Reckless, Fringe-Aligned.

Rumors:

“Curious Flame nearly blew up the Lab again.”

“That one drinks their own brews to see what happens.”

C. The Quiet Observer

Behavior:

Spares Ragged King.

Focuses on lore/exploration contracts.

Moderate hunts, few flashy kills.

Result:

Formal: Bound Hunter / Sworn Ember.

Epithets:

Huntmasters: Surehand (if effective).

Scholars: Field-Quill.

Axes:

Merciful, Cautious, Lodge-Faithful (depending on choices).

Rumors:

“They watched the great stag and let it walk.”

“Field-Quill’s notes on beasts are in the Gallery now.”

Integration Summary

58 – Alchemy:

Epithets and rumors often reference your brew usage.

Events like Infirmary Rush and Vigil ask for your brews, then spread stories about that.

59 – Lodge Rep:

Formal titles and circle epithets derive from circle rep levels.

Social axes modulate how rep is perceived (same rank, different style).

61 / B103 – Hunts:

Signature Hunts and outcomes are main drivers of:

Big rumors.

New trophies.

Epithets.

91 / B101 – Corruption & Wards:

Vigil, warding, sample experiments all feed into:

Warden epithets.

Corruption rumors.

B100 – Quarters:

Quarters visually reflect:

Title.

Trophies tied to Hunts and festivals.

Social artifacts (letters, gifts).

B102 – Lodge Projects:

Completion credited in gossip:

“They paid for that roof.”

Some projects unlock social content:

Feast.

Better common room scenes.

B104 – Events & Festivals:

Feasts and Vigils are prime social lenses:

Where your titles and epithets are used most explicitly.

Where your social axes are showcased.

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

Once this framework exists, later content can:

Add new epithets for new circles and factions.

Expand axes:

Political alignments.

Attitudes toward specific species, gods, or regions.

Build long arcs:

Your overall legend in Emberwild.

How multiple Lodges speak of you differently.

But the base remains:

Actions → Rep + Axes → Titles & Epithets → Rumors & Reactions.
