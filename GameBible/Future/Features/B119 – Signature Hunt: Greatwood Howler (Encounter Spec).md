This is a boss encounter spec for one of the earliest “true Hunts” that tests whether the player actually learned Greatwood fundamentals before diving deep into corruption.

Narrative Identity

What it is

An enormous, battle-scarred alpha Ridge Wolf that has ruled a large swath of Ragged Verge for years.

Not corrupted by Black Sap (or only lightly, in some variants); instead, it’s a symbol of raw, natural danger.

What it represents

The moment the player stops being “just another hunter” and becomes someone other hunters swap stories about.

A test of:

Pack behavior comprehension.

Positioning and focus fire.

Managing fear/suppression and momentum in a clean, readable fight.

Perception

Visual:

Larger than any normal Ridge Wolf.

Greyed muzzle, thick mane of scars and bristling fur.

One ear torn, one eye possibly clouded.

Audio:

A signature howl that:

Echoes off trees.

Sends normal wolves into a frenzy.

Briefly shakes the UI/camera during key moments.

Prerequisites & Entry
Level & Player State

Intended level band: 10–14.

Soft expectations:

Player is comfortable with:

Standard Hunts (H1–H4 from B115).

Basic mitigation (blocking, dodging).

Has:

Basic food buffs.

A small repertoire of brews (healing, stamina, maybe one defensive).

Structural / Contract Prereqs

Strongly recommended:

Completion of some Ragged Verge Hunts:

H1 “Thinning the Ridge”

H4 “Echo on the Verge”

Completion of SH-S1 – “Silence in the Ridge” (B116) before taking this Hunt:

Reduces pack density in the actual fight.

Adds a bit of Huntmaster flavor and prep.

Hunt Setup

Posted on Hunt Board as Signature Hunt: “The Greatwood Howler”.

Briefing NPCs:

Huntmaster Ruarc and Scout-Captain Lyss Fen.

Narrative framing:

Ruarc:

“Every Lodge that lasts has a Howler story. This one will be ours.”

Lyss:

Gives practical advice:

“Don’t let the pack surround you. When it howls, keep your head.”

Player is advised to:

Bring:

At least one bleed-resist or healing brew.

A stamina support brew.

Consider:

Having a Warden-ish friend or some control tools, but this is not mandatory.

Arena & Environment
Location: The Ragged Clearing

A wide, mossy clearing deep in Ragged Verge (B113).

Key visuals:

Ancient, massive stump at or near center.

A few large stones and fallen logs around perimeter.

Tree line at edges is dense and dark; eyes occasionally glint in shadows.

Time & Weather

Default variant:

Night or late dusk Hunt.

Slight mist close to ground for mood, but not heavy enough to obscure readability.

Some conditions:

Wind occasionally gusts during howls, carrying sound.

Arena Layout

Rough circle of open space:

Central stump / rock outcrop.

Several pieces of cover:

Fallen logs.

Rock slabs.

Perimeter:

Tree line where wolves enter/exit.

Environmental Elements

Cover Objects

Stump and rocks:

Block line of sight for some attacks.

Give safe spots during certain Howler abilities.

Small Terrain Hazards

A few shallow ravines and roots:

Slight obstacle to movement.

Encourage repositioning rather than just kiting in a circle.

Pack Spawn Points

Edge-of-clearing entry points:

Where Ridge Wolves (adds) appear.

Tied to pack-call abilities.

Encounter Structure

Four phases:

Phase 0 – Approach Through the Verge

Phase 1 – The Pack’s Teeth

Phase 2 – The Lone Howl

Phase 3 – The Wounded King

Post-Fight – Lodge Echoes & Trophy

Phase 0 – Approach Through the Verge
Flow

Short, atmospheric approach from Ragged Verge trail into the Ragged Clearing.

Encounters along the way:

One small pack of normal Ridge Wolves.

Possibly a stronger wolf or boar mini-elite.

Purpose:

Warm-up.

Let player get into combat rhythm.

Lyss may be present:

As a non-combat or limited-combat support in the approach path.

She peels off at clearing edge:

“This is your Hunt. I’ll keep the trails safe.”

On arrival at clearing edge:

Camera or attention drawn to:

The center as the Howler steps onto stump or rises from grass.

Short non-interactive moment:

Howler sniffs the air, locks eyes with player, and lets out a long, low howl.

Then Phase 1 begins.

Phase 1 – The Pack’s Teeth

Fantasy: The Howler lets its pack test you first, using coordinated behavior and fear pressure.

State

Howler:

Stays near center of clearing or atop central stump.

Only engages directly:

Occasionally to punish mistakes.

Adds:

Active:

3–5 Ridge Wolves at a time.

Density:

Reduced by completion of SH-S1 (Silence in the Ridge).

Howler Abilities (Phase 1)

Commanding Howl (Pack Rally)

The Howler lifts its head and howls.

Effects:

Calls in more Ridge Wolves from edges:

If any alive, they gain a brief DAMAGE UP buff.

Applies mild SUPPRESSED status to player:

Slightly reduced stamina regen / slower lock-on changes for a short window.

Counterplay:

Stay calm:

Player must not panic and over-commit rolls.

Use this telegraph:

To reposition and prepare for incoming pack.

Watchful Lunge

If player stays near pack edge too long:

Howler makes a sudden mid-range leap from central area.

Damage:

Solid Physical – Slashing.

Status:

Possible BLEED on direct hit.

Counterplay:

Recognize lunge cues:

Body crouch, focused stare, low growl.

Dodge sideways rather than backwards (flanking wolves behind you).

Pack (Ridge Wolves) Behavior

Flank & Harass

Wolves attempt to:

Circle and attack from sides/back.

Simple AI rule:

They avoid dog-piling in exact same spot; try to keep 1–2 in front, others circling.

Fear Response

When the Howler howls:

Wolves momentarily:

Scatter outward.

Then re-engage with increased aggression.

Flee & Regroup

When low HP:

Some wolves flee to treeline.

If left alive:

May return in later moments of fight.

Player Learning Goals

Learn to:

Fight groups intelligently:

Keep pack in front arc.

Use environment to avoid getting boxed in.

Read:

Howler’s howls as both threat and pattern marker.

The fight should feel:

Manageable but punishing for players who tunnel on adds in bad positions.

Phase transition:

At ~75–80% Howler HP:

Once enough wolves are slain and the player has proven competent.

Howler stops relying on pack, vaults into full engagement → Phase 2.

Phase 2 – The Lone Howl

Fantasy: The pack has been blooded or scattered; now the alpha tests you directly, using fear, lunges, and high mobility.

State

Howler:

Fully active:

Roams the whole clearing.

Pack:

Only sporadic wolves join in (1–2 at a time, if at all).

Abilities

Raking Charge

Telegraph:

Howler lowers its body, paws digging into ground.

Effect:

High-speed straight-line charge.

Damage:

Heavy Physical – Slashing + KNOCKDOWN on direct hit.

Secondary:

Shallow grooves on ground for a moment, purely visual (reinforces path).

Counterplay:

Sidestep or roll at proper timing.

Use cover objects if path is predictable.

Circle-and-Feint

Behavior:

Howler moves in a wide circle around player in mid-range.

After short time:

Either:

Quick dart-in bite.

Or faint retreat, gauging player reaction.

Purpose:

Tests player’s patience.

Punishes over-aggressive lunges.

Shattering Howl

Upgraded howl:

More intense than Commanding Howl.

Effects:

Moderate SUPPRESSED status:

Slight shake in camera.

Brief, heavier stamina regen penalty.

If any wolves remain:

They may panic and briefly retreat (flavor).

Counterplay:

Maintain orientation.

Use this as:

A reset window to heal or reposition if the Howler isn’t mid-attack.

Bleeding Bite

Close-range combo finisher.

Damage:

Solid Physical.

Status:

Strong BLEED DoT.

Counterplay:

Block with good timing (if using shield).

Avoid being in front at the end of its combos.

Player Learning Goals

Practice:

Single big enemy pattern reading.

When to take risks vs when to wait out feints/howls.

Encourages:

Understanding stamina management under SUPPRESSED debuff.

Phase transition:

At ~45–50% HP:

The Howler begins to show:

Limping.

Heavier breathing.

Fight shifts toward a more desperate, unpredictable style → Phase 3.

Phase 3 – The Wounded King

Fantasy: Mortally wounded but proud, the Howler fights viciously and unpredictably, mixing lunges and howls in increasingly frantic patterns.

State

Howler:

Shorter movements.

Occasionally staggers.

Environment:

A bit more torn up:

Dirt scoured.

Maybe a blood trail or two.

Ability Modifications & Additions

Ragged Charge

Variant of Raking Charge:

Slightly less distance.

More erratic path:

Tends to veer mid-charge.

Harder to predict:

For players who rely solely on straight-line dodges.

Broken Howl

Howl that:

Now alternates between:

Creating a stronger SUPPRESSED effect.

Or briefly stunning itself (exhaustion).

Design:

Small chance the Howler misjudges its own strength:

Stumbles after big howl.

Creates a punish window.

Counterplay:

Players who observe patterns:

Capitalize on these brief self-stagger moments.

Desperate Snap

Quick, short-range bite used:

Whenever player stays locked to its flank or rear too long.

Damage:

Moderate.

Status:

Mild BLEED.

Purpose:

Prevent trivializing fight by just sticking on the back and mashing.

Last Stand

When HP < 15%.

Howler may:

Let out one final, very long howl.

Effects:

Temporary significant SUPPRESSED effect:

Could slightly blur edges of screen.

Reduced audio clarity for a moment.

One final wave of:

1–2 wolves (if any left to call).

Counterplay:

Keep composure.

Focus:

Either on finishing Howler quickly.

Or clearing adds if low health.

Player Learning Goals

“Finish the fight” discipline:

No panic, no sloppy greed.

Accept:

That high HP bosses have “desperation” moves.

When Howler HP reaches zero:

It collapses near center of clearing:

Either falls from stump or simply crumples.

A final, weak exhale/howl fades into silence.

Remaining wolves:

If any:

Flee into the trees.
