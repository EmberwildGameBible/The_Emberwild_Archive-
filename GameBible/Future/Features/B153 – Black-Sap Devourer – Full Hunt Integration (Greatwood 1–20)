# B153 – Black-Sap Devourer – Full Hunt Integration (Greatwood 1–20)

---

## 0. PURPOSE & SCOPE

This file defines the **Black-Sap Devourer** as a fully integrated **Greatwood Hunt** for levels 10–18 (primary band: B/C) and sets it into the larger Greatwood 1–20 ecosystem.

It covers:

- Identity, story, and visual/audio fantasy.
- Unlock conditions and Lodge integration.
- Arena layout and environment hazards.
- Full fight structure:
  - Approach → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (soft enrage).
- Role expectations across **combat roles** and **professions**:
  - Hunters (melee/ranged DPS, tanks, supports).
  - Cooks (prep and mid-fight consumables).
  - Alchemists (wards, bombs, brews).
  - Foragers/Woodworkers (environmental tools).
- Rewards and loot integration:
  - Ingredients (51, 55).
  - Cooking & brewing hooks (52–53, 58).
  - Lodge trophies & projects (57, B162).
  - B151 Greatwood loot tables and specialty/pity hooks.
- Implementation-facing notes for encounter scripting.

Black-Sap Devourer should feel like:

> “You went too far into the black-sap grove. Now the grove itself has decided to eat you.”

---

## 1. HUNT IDENTITY & FANTASY

### 1.1 High-Concept Tagline

- **Tagline:** “The grove that drinks hunters.”

The Black-Sap Devourer is:

- A **massive, corrupted stag-thing** fused with Hollowroot growths and black-sap tumors.
- A predator that lures prey into an area saturated with choking, sticky sap.
- Less “a monster in a forest” and more “a forest that has decided to use a monster as its mouth.”

### 1.2 Visual Motifs

- Body
  - Stag skeleton warped and swollen with sap-filled sacs.
  - Exposed ribcage with visible black-sap flow pulsing like a heart.
  - Antlers twisted into hooks and branches dripping viscous sap.
- Environment
  - Trees with darkened bark and glistening black runnels.
  - Root-like tendrils snaking along the ground toward pools of sap.
  - Occasional **amber-like globules** hanging from branches.
- UI / FX
  - Black-sap puddles are glossy, almost mirror-like, with slow bubble pops.
  - Corruption stacks represented with **sap blotches** encroaching on the edge of the HUD.

### 1.3 Audio Motifs

- Ambience:
  - Wet, sticky sounds; slow drip, distant “cracks” of hardened sap breaking.
  - Muffled forest noise, as if sound is absorbed by the sap.
- Boss:
  - Hollow, echoing stag bellows mixed with gurgling, liquid resonance.
  - Heavy, sucking footsteps when moving through his own sap.
- Abilities:
  - **Sap spit:** sharp pressure hiss → wet smack → slow “tearing” noise as it hardens.
  - **Roots:** creaking wood, fibrous ripping, soil shifting before they emerge.

### 1.4 Emotional Beats

Player should feel:

- **Curiosity** entering the grove (“this is weird, why is everything so dark and sticky?”).
- **Dread** as the environment itself starts participating (ground hazards, roots).
- **Panic** when sap levels rise and movement becomes constrained.
- **Triumph + disgust** when they finally kill the Devourer and the grove exhales.

This is a **mid-Greatwood corruption boss**, not a purely endcap. It establishes what “corrupted Greatwood” feels like.

---

## 2. UNLOCK CONDITIONS & STORY FRAMING

### 2.1 Recommended Unlock Band

- Designed for **levels 12–16** with some flex above and below.
- Ideal entry **Phase C** (11–15) from B152:
  - After players have:
    - Completed at least one earlier Hunt (Elder Stag or Ward-Bear).
    - Seen Hollowroot corruption in lesser pockets.
    - Unlocked a few key recipes and basic alchemy.

### 2.2 Prerequisites (Design-Level)

The Devourer unlocks on the Hunt Board when:

- Player has completed:
  - **1x early Hunt** (Elder Hollow Stag or Ward-Bear).
  - **N Hollowroot activities**, e.g.:
    - 2–3 Hollowroot pockets cleared.
    - One mini-event involving black-sap pools.
- Player has delivered at least one **Lodge project** related to:
  - “Studying the sap” or “Fortifying against corruption.”

This allows NPCs to say:

> “You’ve seen the sap in the shallow pockets. That’s just leakage. Something deeper is feeding it.”

### 2.3 Narrative Setup

**Quest text tone (paraphrased):**

- The Lodge has tracked unusually aggressive black-sap growth in a specific pocket.
- Foragers have gone missing; a returning hunter speaks of:
  > “An antlered shadow wading through a pool that tried to pull me under.”
- The Hunt briefing:
  - Emphasizes **terrain**, not just the boss.
  - Warns about **sap poisoning** and recommends:
    - Certain stews (anti-corruption).
    - Certain brews (movement, cleansing).

### 2.4 NPC & Lodge Integration

- Lodge NPCs involved:
  - **Huntmaster** – posts the Hunt, explains mechanics in diegetic terms.
  - **Sap-studying Scholar/Alchemist** – gives optional prep quests to craft brews.
  - **Cook** – recommends stews that counteract corruption.

Hook into B162:

- Completing this Hunt:
  - Unlocks new Lodge décor:
    - A sap-stained antler display.
    - A blackened tree segment with hardened sap.
  - Progresses a Lodge project line:
    - “Black-Sap Containment.”

---

## 3. ARENA & ENVIRONMENT DESIGN

### 3.1 Location & Pocket

Pocket tag: `POCKET_BLACK_SAP_GROVE`

- Geography:
  - Depressed grove, slightly bowl-shaped.
  - Surrounded by thick trees and Hollowroot-infested trunks.
  - One primary entry trail from safer Greatwood.
- Verticality:
  - Slightly lower central area where sap pools gather.
  - Raised root-clumps / ridges around edges to create “safe spots” from sap.

### 3.2 Layout Zones

Divide the arena into zones:

- **Zone A – Outer Ring (Relatively Safe)**
  - Firmer ground, scattered small sap patches.
  - Root-clusters that can be used for line-of-sight and cover.
- **Zone B – Inner Ring (Hazardous)**
  - Frequent sap puddles that periodically expand/contract.
  - Sap-coating on tree roots; movement penalties if stepped on.
- **Zone C – Heart Pool**
  - Central, larger sap basin.
  - Devourer frequently paths through or stands in this.
  - Late phase: sap in this zone rises and begins to spread outward.

### 3.3 Hazard Types

- **Static Sap Puddles**
  - Always present, small radius.
  - Deals low, stacking corruption damage if stood in.
- **Growing Sap Puddles**
  - Spawn during fight mechanics.
  - Start small, then expand, then harden (hazard changes).
- **Hardened Sap Masses**
  - Once fully hardened, act as:
    - Line-of-sight blockers.
    - Terrain obstacles.
  - Can be broken with effort, leaving a temporary “safe” patch.

### 3.4 Navigation & Readability

Design goals:

- Players must **constantly reposition** to avoid sap spread.
- There is always **somewhere safe**, but never too convenient.
- Visual cues:
  - Sap grows with a clear “creeping border” effect.
  - Hardened sap develops a crusty texture and a different color/value.

---

## 4. MECHANICAL THEMES & OVERVIEW

### 4.1 Core Themes

1. **Territory Control**
   - Sap pools shrink the space.
   - Players must guide the boss and manage where sap lands.

2. **Corruption Management**
   - Standing in sap or getting hit by certain attacks builds **Black-Sap Corruption** stacks.
   - High stacks result in:
     - Periodic health drain.
     - Reduced healing taken.
     - Slowed movement.

3. **Target Priority & Environmental Use**
   - Adds and rooted “sap hearts” must be killed/destroyed.
   - Breaking hardened sap can open safe areas but costs DPS/time.

4. **Preparation Matters**
   - Food and brews specifically targeting:
     - Corruption resistance.
     - Movement speed.
     - Cleanse effects.
   - Hunts become a stress test for **Greatwood cooking/alchemy** systems.

### 4.2 Fight Structure Overview

Phases:

- **Phase 0 – Approach**
  - Minor sap hazards; Devourer not yet fully enraged.
- **Phase 1 – Sap Awakens**
  - Basic pattern: frontal swipes, sap spit cones, small pools.
- **Phase 2 – Grove Collusion**
  - Roots, adds, expanding sap; players juggle boss + environment.
- **Phase 3 – Heart Burst (Soft Enrage)**
  - Central pool rises; high sap uptime.
  - Players must kill the boss before the grove becomes unplayable.

---

## 5. PHASE BREAKDOWNS

### 5.0 Shared Mechanics & Systems

Before phases, define:

- **Black-Sap Corruption (Status)**
  - Stackable debuff.
  - Each stack:
    - Slightly reduces healing received.
    - Adds minor damage taken from sap interactions.
  - If stacks above threshold `N`, player periodically **vomits sap**:
    - Small puddle spawns at their feet.

- **Sap Density Meter (Encounter Meter)**
  - A hidden or optional visual meter representing total sap in the arena.
  - Drives:
    - Thresholds for new mechanic triggers.
    - Soft enrage conditions.

---

### 5.1 Phase 0 – Approach & First Contact

**Trigger**

- Players enter `POCKET_BLACK_SAP_GROVE` and cross a threshold (e.g. a fallen tree).
- Ambient sap density is low but rising.

**Gameplay**

- A few lesser corrupted beasts (sentries) guard the path.
- Small sap puddles required to be navigated.
- Devourer is seen feeding at the central pool, then roars and moves to engage.

**Purpose**

- Teaches:
  - “Don’t stand in the shiny black stuff.”
  - “The grove has zones; some places feel worse than others.”

---

### 5.2 Phase 1 – Sap Awakens

**HP Range**

- Devourer at 100% → ~70% HP.

**Mechanics**

1. **Basic Attacks**
   - Heavy front swipes.
   - Occasional antler gore charges (targeted at furthest or highest threat).

2. **Black-Sap Spit (Cone)**
   - Telegraph: Devourer rears back, sap glows in mouth.
   - Fires a short cone of sap:
     - On hit: moderate damage + 1 corruption stack.
     - Leaves **small sap puddles** on ground.

3. **Sap Drip Zones**
   - Random small puddles appear in the inner ring.
   - Provide early practice moving out of them.

**Player Checks**

- Tanks:
  - Learn facing/positioning.
- DPS:
  - Learn not to stand in front arcs.
- Everyone:
  - Issues of movement and puddle avoidance.

---

### 5.3 Phase 2 – The Grove Joins In

**Trigger**

- Devourer reaches ~70% HP.
- Sap Density meter passes first threshold.

**New Mechanics Added**

1. **Rootburst**
   - Roots surge in a telegraphed ring or wedge.
   - If hit:
     - Short root/snare.
     - 1–2 corruption stacks.
   - Often combos with sap spit to trap players in puddles.

2. **Sap-Heart Bulbs (Adds)**
   - Bulbous sap nodes emerge from the ground.
   - Channel sap into existing puddles, causing them to:
     - **Spread** outward.
     - Increase damage ticks.
   - Must be destroyed quickly to prevent arena from shrinking too much.

3. **Hollowroot Pack Adds**
   - Corrupted smaller beasts spawn from the outer ring.
   - Harass healers/backline; can be kited into “safe zones” or AoE’d down.

**Environmental Shift**

- Sap in the central pool slightly rises.
- Some outer ring areas gain **thin sap films** (small movement penalty only).

**Player Checks**

- Group must:
  - Coordinate target priority (sap-hearts vs boss vs adds).
  - Keep the Devourer away from already-heavy sap zones.
  - Use food/brews for corruption mitigation.

---

### 5.4 Phase 3 – Heart Burst (Soft Enrage)

**Trigger**

- Devourer reaches ~35–40% HP.
- Sap Density meter crosses second threshold.

**New Mechanics Added**

1. **Heartburst Roar**
   - Devourer slams chest; central pool surges.
   - Sap rapidly expands from center, then stabilizes at a **higher baseline level**.
   - Some previously safe ground is now either:
     - Soft sap (slow + low damage).
     - Or fully hazardous pools.

2. **Black-Sap Flood (Wave)**
   - Periodic **wave of sap** rolling outwards:
     - Similar to a shockwave, but with sap.
     - Players must jump, move behind hardened sap, or use movement abilities.

3. **Leeching Antlers**
   - Devourer’s attacks:
     - Apply increased corruption.
     - Heal the Devourer slightly when hitting highly corrupted players.
   - Encourages chained cleanses and careful stack management.

4. **Accelerated Rootburst**
   - Rootburst occurs more frequently.
   - Combos with Flood and saps the arena further.

**Soft Enrage Condition**

- If fight drags too long:
  - Sap Density meter fills.
  - Arena becomes nearly entirely sap:
    - Movement/visibility heavily impaired.
    - Damage ramps up.
  - Practical wipe.

**Player Checks**

- Do they:
  - Have enough DPS to push through last ~35%?
  - Use cleanses and anti-corruption properly?
  - Manage arena real estate via sap-heart destruction?

---

## 7. ROLE EXPECTATIONS & PROFESSION INTEGRATION

### 7.1 Combat Roles (Generic)

We keep roles **system-agnostic**; the exact names/abilities depend on Emberwild’s class design.

- **Frontliners / Tanks**
  - Control boss facing and positioning:
    - Keep Devourer out of densest sap zones when possible.
  - Soak basic swipes and gore, with mitigation.
  - Grab Hollowroot add aggro away from backline.

- **Melee DPS**
  - Dance around puddles while staying on boss/priority targets.
  - Help burst sap-hearts when they spawn nearby.
  - Provide interrupts/CC on key casts if available.

- **Ranged DPS**
  - Primary answer for:
    - Sap-heart bulbs.
    - Spread-out adds.
  - Call out safe zones and heavy sap patches over VO/text.

- **Healers / Support**
  - Manage:
    - Corruption cleanse effects.
    - Movement buffs for Flood / Rootburst combos.
  - Use food/brew bonuses to handle heavy healing windows (Phase 3).

### 7.2 Cook Role

From B151 + Cooking chapters:

- **Pre-Hunt Preparation**
  - Cook can propose a “Hunt Menu”:
    - 1 main stew focused on **corruption resistance or cleanse**.
    - 1 secondary dish for **movement speed or stamina**.
  - Optional dessert/side that:
    - Increases healing throughput or regen.

- **Mid-Hunt Options**
  - Certain higher-tier meals may:
    - Provide **emergency cleanse** on use.
    - Temporarily reduce sap damage at high corruption stacks.

Goal: Hunts **feel better** when players take cooking seriously.

### 7.3 Alchemist Role

- **Brews & Tonics**
  - Anti-corruption tonics:
    - Reduce stack gain or accelerate decay for X seconds.
  - Movement tonics:
    - Short bursts of movement speed for Flood events.
  - Resist brews:
    - Slightly lower magic damage taken from sap sources.

- **Bombs & Devices**
  - “Sap-Burst Vials”:
    - Targeted at hardened sap to **shatter** them and clear space.
  - “Root-Sever Bombs”:
    - Extra damage against sap-heart bulbs and root clusters.

### 7.4 Forager / Woodworker Role

- **Pre-Hunt Craftables**
  - Deployable **root stakes**:
    - Places breakable structures that block Rootburst lines.
  - Lightweight **bridging planks**:
    - Lay small “boards” across sap to create narrow safe paths.

- **Mid-Hunt Interaction**
  - May interact with certain environmental props:
    - Cut down a sap-infested branch to create cover.
    - Clear vine walls to open additional kiting routes.

These roles give Hunts a **cross-profession** identity, not just pure combat.

---

## 8. LOOT & REWARD INTEGRATION (WITH B151)

### 8.1 Thematic Ingredient Outputs

Black-Sap Devourer is the primary source for the following (representative IDs):

- `black_sap_nodule` – condensed pockets of corrupted sap.
- `black_sap_reduction` – a processed variant (could be made via cooking/alchemy).
- `sapstained_antler` – corrupted antler pieces (extends from non-Hunt stag antlers).
- `devourer_heart_fragment` – small pieces of the boss’s core; rare.

Drop structure:

- **Base drop bundle (on kill, for all participants)**
  - 1–3 `black_sap_nodule`.
  - 1–2 `sapstained_antler` (or variants).
- **Conditional / difficulty-based**
  - Chance for additional nodules / heart fragments on higher difficulty tiers.

### 8.2 Lodge Trophies & Projects

Completing this Hunt:

- Always drops one **trophy item** (per kill, not per player):
  - `trophy_black_sap_antler`.
- Lodge projects (57, B162) can require:
  - A number of trophy pieces and nodules for:
    - “Black-Sap Containment” line (more wards around Lodge).
    - Visual Lodge changes (sap research corner, hardened sap lamp, etc).

### 8.3 Chase Items & Rare Drops

From B151’s world drop philosophy:

- Devourer’s **Hunt reward bundle** has a small chance to include:

  - `trinket_black_sap_charm`
    - Passive small buff vs corruption.
    - Flavorful text about the sap’s whisper.
  - `recipe_scroll_black_sap_stew`
    - Advanced stew that:
      - Temporarily reduces corruption gain.
      - Adds some offensive benefit to encourage risk.

Ultra-rare tie-ins:

- A tiny chance for a **relic-touched fragment** that references B139–B150/B143:
  - E.g. `relic_splinter_sapbound_antler`.

### 8.4 B151 Integration Hooks

In `LootTables_Special_Greatwood.lua`:

- Define a `HUNT_BLACK_SAP_DEVOURER_BUNDLE` using B151 schema.
- Black-Sap specialty track in `SpecialtyPity_Greatwood.lua`:

  ```lua
  SpecialtyPity.tracks.black_sap_specialty = {
      expected_rolls = 8,      -- typical kills before one specialty hit
      hard_cap_rolls = 20,     -- absolutely guaranteed by then
      min_band = "B",
      max_band = "D",
      sources = { "HUNT_BLACK_SAP_DEVOURER", "POCKET_BLACK_SAP_GROVE" },
  }
This ensures that players targeting this content see at least some specials over multiple Hunts.

9. DIFFICULTY & TUNING
9.1 Level & Band Expectations
Recommended entry:

Level 12–13 for a group.

Level 15–16 for a very skilled, well-prepared smaller group/duo.

Aligned with B151 Bands:

Primary band: C (11–15).

Spillover into late B / early D as replay content.

9.2 Fight Duration & Failure Modes
Target baseline:

Fight duration: 7–10 minutes for a reasonably geared group of appropriate level.

Common failure modes:

Too much sap spread; arena becomes unmanageable.

Corruption stacks ignored; players heal through it until Phase 3 punishes them.

Ignoring sap-hearts → exponential sap hazard.

9.3 Adjustables (For Tuning)
Sap growth speed and maximum coverage.

Corruption stack caps and decay speed.

Add wave frequency and size.

Hunt reward quantities (nodules, trophies, chase items).

Soft enrage timing via Sap Density thresholds.

10. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (ENCOUNTER SCRIPTING)
10.1 State Machine Outline
Recommended states:

STATE_IDLE – Devourer at pool; ambient behavior.

STATE_AGGRO – Engages players; Phase 1 logic.

STATE_PHASE2 – Roots + sap-hearts integrated.

STATE_PHASE3 – Heartburst + Flood + soft enrage.

STATE_RESET – Players wiped or left arena; cleanup.

Pseudo-Lua skeleton:

lua
Copy code
local Devourer = {}
Devourer.__index = Devourer

function Devourer.new(model)
    local self = setmetatable({}, Devourer)
    self.model = model
    self.state = "IDLE"
    self.hp = self:getMaxHP()
    self.sapDensity = 0
    return self
end

function Devourer:update(dt)
    if self.state == "IDLE" then
        self:updateIdle(dt)
    elseif self.state == "AGGRO" then
        self:updatePhase1(dt)
    elseif self.state == "PHASE2" then
        self:updatePhase2(dt)
    elseif self.state == "PHASE3" then
        self:updatePhase3(dt)
    end
end

function Devourer:onHit(damage)
    self.hp -= damage
    if self.state == "AGGRO" and self.hp <= self:getMaxHP() * 0.70 then
        self:transitionTo("PHASE2")
    elseif self.state == "PHASE2" and self.hp <= self:getMaxHP() * 0.40 then
        self:transitionTo("PHASE3")
    end
end
10.2 Sap System Integration
Separate module managing all sap puddles, hardened sap, and sap density:

BlackSapSystem_Grove.lua.

Devourer script does not directly modify puddles:

Instead, triggers high-level calls:

BlackSapSystem:SpawnPuddle(position, size, type)

BlackSapSystem:SpawnSapHeart(position)

BlackSapSystem:RaisePool(amount)

This keeps environment and boss logic modular.

10.3 Loot Hook
When Devourer dies:

Construct a LootContext with:

mobId = "HUNT_BLACK_SAP_DEVOURER"

isHuntTarget = true

zoneTag = "POCKET_BLACK_SAP_GROVE"

Player list = participants.

Call:

lua
Copy code
local lootBundle = ResolveLoot_Greatwood(ctx)
-- plus explicit Hunt reward bundle injection:
local huntBundle = HuntRewards:GetDevourerBundle(ctx)
mergeLoot(lootBundle, huntBundle)
awardLootToPlayers(players, lootBundle)
11. VARIANTS & FUTURE EXPANSIONS
Later expansions or difficulty modes could introduce:

Night-Only Variant

Increased sap spread.

More spectral adds.

Wardstone Surge Variant

Ward entities attempt to contain sap during fight:

Players can cooperate with, or accidentally sabotage, wards.

Relic-Touched Variant (Endgame)

Devourer partially fused with a minor relic:

More intense mechanics.

Higher chance of relic-touched drops.

These variants reuse core arena and abilities but tweak parameters and add layers.

12. TELEMETRY & BALANCING
12.1 Metrics to Log
Per encounter instance:

Number of wipes vs kills.

Time to kill (successful attempts).

Average corruption stacks per player (over time).

Sap coverage % at kill or wipe.

Number of sap-space clearing actions:

Hardened sap destroyed.

Sap-hearts killed.

Food/brew usage:

Which recipes were consumed pre-Hunt.

Whether anti-corruption/cleanse items were used.

12.2 Success Targets
Success rate:

~30–40% for appropriately leveled, minimally prepared groups.

Should climb to 60–70% with:

Better gear.

Correct food/brews.

Learned mechanics.

13. SUMMARY
Black-Sap Devourer is the corruption keystone Hunt for Greatwood:

Teaches:

Territory control.

Corruption management.

The value of cooking, alchemy, and Lodge prep.

Integrates with:

B151 (loot).

B152 (systems index).

B153–B159 (Hunt arc).

B160–B162 (Greatwood flow, Lodge projects).

If Elder Stag and Ward-Bear are “Greatwood 101,”
Black-Sap Devourer is “Greatwood 201: The woods bite back.”
