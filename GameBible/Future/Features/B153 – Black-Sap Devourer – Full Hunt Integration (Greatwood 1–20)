# B153 – Black-Sap Devourer – Full Hunt Integration (Greatwood 1–20)

## 0. Purpose

Define the **Black-Sap Devourer** as a fully integrated Hunt:

- Clear identity and fantasy
- Unlocks and story beats
- Arena layout and fight phases
- Role expectations for each profession (Hunter, Cook, Alchemist, Forager/Woodworker)
- Rewards:
  - Base ingredients from 51
  - Specialty ingredients from 55
  - Loot rules in line with B151
  - Lodge projects, trophies, recipes, and brews from 52, 53, 57, 58

This file is the “one stop” reference so you don’t have to cross-read six other docs to remember what this Hunt is supposed to be.

## 1. Role in Greatwood

**Name:** Black-Sap Devourer  
**Region:** Deep Greatwood, near corruption-heavy glades  
**Band:** End of Greatwood 1–20 (recommended 16–20)  
**Type:** Signature Hunt (B117) – corruption / wardline themed

### 1.1 Narrative Identity

The Black-Sap Devourer is:

- A creature that has **overfed on corrupted sap**, becoming a moving sink of Black Sap.
- A visible **scar on the wardlines** around Greatwood, especially near Hollowroot and Wardstone Hill.
- The first time players see **Black Sap** as a system:
  - Not just a visual effect, but a resource with risk and power.

It sits at the intersection of:

- 55 – Black-Sap specialty ingredients  
- 58 – Black-Sap brews and tonics  
- 57 – Lodge Black-Sap trophy/project content  
- B151 – loot system ownership of Black-Sap reagents

---

## 2. Unlock & Questline Flow

### 2.1 Recommended Unlock Order

The Devourer should feel like **mid–late Greatwood corruption content**, ideally unlocked after:

- Some progress with:
  - Hollowroot pockets / Matron (Hollowroot intro)
  - Wardstone Hill side content (ward basics)
- At least one earlier Hunt (Elder Stag or Ward-Bear) completed.

Suggested prerequisites (design, not code):

- Player completes:
  - One early Hunt (Elder Stag or Ward-Bear).
  - At least one Hollowroot pocket event.
- Player reaches a minimum Lodge reputation threshold with Wardens/Hunters.

### 2.2 Questline Beats

1. **Rumors on the Hunt Board**
   - Board posting: blurred, second-hand reports:
     - “Something is overfeeding in the glades. Trees bleeding tar. Animals fouled.”
   - Simple contract: investigate corrupted glades (no boss yet).

2. **Evidence and Small Events**
   - Player:
     - Fights corrupted wildlife, collects `black_sap_nodule` from terrain or minor mobs.
     - Brings back samples to Lodge alchemist.
   - Alchemist NPC:
     - Introduces the idea of **Black Sap** as a substance, not just “goo”.

3. **First True Posting – “The Devourer”**
   - Named Hunt unlocks on board:
     - “The Devourer has been seen near a standing wardstone. If it keeps feeding, the wards will fail.”
   - Quest chain:
     - Track sap trails,
     - Clear corrupt sap sprouts,
     - Disable or brace minor wardstones.

4. **Final Approach**
   - Player is sent to:
     - A corrupted grove where the Devourer has partially merged with the terrain.
   - This triggers the **Hunt instance** / encounter.

5. **Post-Hunt Fallout**
   - Lodge and Ward NPCs:
     - React to victory.
     - Unlock:
       - Alchemy: Black-Sap brews (58).
       - Lodge project: Black-Sap trophy (57).
       - Profession tools: Black-Sap gauntlets and kettle (54/57, later).

---

## 3. Arena & Encounter Space

### 3.1 Visual Layout

The arena is a **ring-shaped corrupted grove**:

- Outer ring:
  - Twisted trees, Black Sap stains, minor sap pools that slow and apply light corruption.
- Mid ring:
  - Broken wardstone fragments, unstable wardlight flickering.
  - Occasional safe patches where sap does not spread as easily.
- Inner core:
  - Devourer’s main “nest”:
    - Large sap pool with thick, viscous surface.
    - Several **half-absorbed deer / stag carcasses**.
    - One or more **corrupted stag** corpses used for special mechanics.

### 3.2 Functional Zones

- **Safe-ish Zones**
  - Slight wardlight glow.
  - Reduced corruption stacking.
  - Ideal for regrouping and using brews/food.

- **Sap Pools**
  - Standing in them:
    - Slows movement.
    - Applies stacking “Black Sap” debuff:
      - Soft damage over time and/or corruption meter.

- **Wardstone Shards**
  - Interactables:
    - Can be “struck” by players to create brief pulses:
      - Push back sap spread.
      - Disrupt some Devourer abilities if timed correctly.

---

## 4. Boss: Black-Sap Devourer – Behavior & Phases

**Category:** Beast / Corrupted Entity  
**Fight Length Target:** 3–6 minutes for a properly prepared group

### 4.1 Baseline Attacks

These exist in multiple phases, scaled per phase.

- **Lunge & Slam**
  - Short charge followed by a slam.
  - Leaves a small sap puddle at the impact location.

- **Sap Spit**
  - Ranged cone or line attack.
  - Applies “Black Sap Spatter” debuff:
    - Small damage over time, slight move slow.

- **Devouring Swipe**
  - Heavy melee swipe.
  - If it hits a player already standing in sap:
    - Amplified corruption damage.

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 – The Hungry Beast

**Trigger:** Fight start, HP 100% → ~70%

Focus: establish the basics.

- Moves:
  - Lunge & Slam
  - Sap Spit
  - Basic ground slam that spawns sap puddles under random players.
- Sap behavior:
  - Puddles:
    - Start small, expand slowly.
    - Clear when a wardstone shard is triggered nearby.
- Role emphasis:
  - Hunter:
    - Keeps boss turned away from party.
    - Kites it slightly between safe zones to prevent overflooding.
  - Alchemist:
    - Uses basic ward/cleanse brews to mitigate damage.
  - Forager/Woodworker:
    - Optional pre-fight set-up: placed stakes/markers can give small buffs (if you want to tie in 57 later).

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 – Gorge & Swell

**Trigger:** Boss reaches ~70% HP, then attempts to **feed on a nearby corrupted stag corpse**.

- Telegraphed event:
  - Devourer moves to the nearest corrupted stag corpse and enters a “gorging” animation.
- Player choice:
  - **Interrupt it**:
    - High DPS check or using wardstone pulses to disrupt.
    - Prevents phase from buffing boss too much.
  - **Allow it** (or fail interrupt):
    - Boss enters **Gorged** state:
      - Gains new abilities.
      - Fight gets harder.
      - Reward chances (special drops) can increase slightly.

New mechanics when Gorged:

- **Sap Geyser**
  - Devourer slams the ground and creates **vertical geysers** of Black Sap.
  - Geysers:
    - Launch sap blobs that land in several locations.
    - Create larger, higher-damage sap pools.

- **Corrupted Pulse**
  - Periodic AoE wave from the boss:
    - Deals damage.
    - Converts small safe zones into sap unless wardstones are pulsed.

- **Swollen Hide (buff)**
  - Increases boss HP or damage temporarily.
  - Potentially linked to better loot chances in design.

---

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Overdrawn

**Trigger:** Boss at ~30% HP; sap saturation in the arena is high.

If players have allowed multiple feeds, phase 3 becomes more intense.

Mechanics:

- **Arena Saturation**
  - Sap coverage increases over time.
  - Wardstone shards must be timed carefully to **carve out safe rough circles**.

- **Black Sap Storm**
  - The sky and canopy darken.
  - Occasional “sap rain”:
    - Short, high-damage pulses that force players to keep moving.
- **Frenzied Devour**
  - Short, telegraphed channel:
    - If a player is downed in a sap pool:
      - Boss attempts to “consume” their position, causing a large local explosion.

Reward hook:

- The longer and riskier the fight (more feeds, higher sap coverage):
  - The slightly better the **chance for ultra-rare drops**, within limits set in B151.

---

## 5. Special Mechanic: Sap-Engorged Antler Condition

This is the condition for dropping:

- `spec_ingr_sap_engorged_antler` (55)

Mechanic:

1. During the fight, a **corrupted stag** is tethered near one side of the arena.
2. If players **lure the Devourer toward the stag** and allow it to:
   - Perform a **full feed** on the stag **once** (not interrupted).
3. Then kill the Devourer while it is still in the **first Gorged state** (don’t allow a second feed):

- Extra loot roll:
  - Chance for `spec_ingr_sap_engorged_antler` from the boss.
- This should be:
  - Risky enough (harder boss due to feed buff),
  - Not required for normal completion.

Design intent:

- Players who want the `sap_engorged_antler` have to **intentionally play suboptimally** on the first feed.
- Gets communicated via Hunt tips, NPC hints, and codex entries.

## 6. Role Expectations by Profession

### 6.1 Hunter

- Pre-fight:
  - Tracks sap trails, finds the correct grove.
- In fight:

- Post-fight:
  - Uses:
    - `spec_ingr_black_sap_seed_nodule` for `brew_black_sap_purge`.
    - `spec_ingr_black_sap_eye_resin` for high-risk `insight` or vision brews.

### 6.4 Forager / Woodworker

- Pre-fight:
  - Could prep:
    - Temporary ward stakes around the grove entrance (later project).
- Post-fight:
  - Helps convert:
    - `spec_ingr_sap_engorged_antler` into trophy/backpiece or Lodge decor (via 57 and trophy tools in 54).
