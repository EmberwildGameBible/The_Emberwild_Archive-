# 63 – Greatwood World Map, Sub-Regions, and Points of Interest

## Purpose

Define the **macro layout** of Greatwood:

- Core sub-regions (biomes / “zones within the zone”)
- Major and minor Points of Interest (POIs)
- How exploration ties into Hunts, Professions, Ingredients, and Events

This is a **high-level spatial design** for Greatwood 1–20, not a final navmesh or level blueprints.

---

## High-Level Structure

Greatwood should feel like one **continuous forest region** with distinct “flavors”:

- **Lodge & Immediate Surroundings** – safe-ish hub, training and early content
- **Hunting Grounds** – classic forest with animals and low-level threats
- **Rivers & Wetlands** – water, fish, herbs, foggy encounters
- **Hollowroot Edge** – transitional zone toward corruption/dungeon content
- **Burn-Scars / Wildfire Glades** – ash, char, dangerous events
- **Cliff/Ridge Lines** – verticality, vantage points, more dangerous beasts

Each has:

- Primary **enemy families**
- Primary **resource types**
- Key **POIs** and **event hooks**

---

## Points of Interest Types

### Major POIs

- **The Lodge**
- **Hollowroot Warren Entrance**
- **Main River Crossings**
- **Major Burn-Scar Glade**
- **Key Clifftop Overlook / Shrine**

Major POIs should have:

- Map markers (once discovered)
- Quest hubs or strong hooks
- Event possibilities (festivals, big hunts, major story beats)

### Minor POIs

- Campsites / abandoned camps
- Hunter hides and blinds
- Small groves, clearings, rock formations
- Mini-caves, dens, old stumps, shrines

Minor POIs anchor:

- Dynamic events (62)
- Small chests/caches
- Ingredient-rich patches

---

## Map Discovery & Progression

- Player starts with **Lodge + immediate area** revealed.
- Other sub-regions & POIs discovered by:
  - Exploration
  - Quests & Deeds
  - Following rumors and directions from NPCs

Possible systems:

- **Soft fog-of-war:** map reveals as player explores.
- **Named regions:** once discovered, region names appear on map.
- **Signposts & markers:** Forester-style signs that provide hints.

---

## Integration with Systems

- **Hunt Board (61):**
  - Hunts reference specific sub-regions.
  - Deeds send players to specific major/minor POIs.

- **Professions (Forester, Cook, Woodworker, Alchemy):**
  - Each sub-region has “signature” ingredients and materials.
  - Foresters and Woodworkers get better tools for navigating or exploiting certain areas.

- **Events (62):**
  - Each sub-region has its own event mix:
    - Misty stag in lowlands
    - Wildfire echoes in burn-scar
    - Whispers near Hollowroot

---

## Next Actions

- Draw a **rough paper map** of Greatwood:
  - Place Lodge, sub-regions, and 5–10 strong POIs.
- For each sub-region:
  - List concrete POIs (name + short description).
  - Tag events, hunts, and profession hooks tied to each.
- Decide which POIs are visible from the start and which must be discovered.
