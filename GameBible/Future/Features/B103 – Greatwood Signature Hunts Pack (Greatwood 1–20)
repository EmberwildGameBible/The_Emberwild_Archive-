If “Formalize the Training Yard” is complete:

Huntmasters offer a short sparring scenario:

Grants a temporary buff vs beasts or a bit of extra info.

Tracking & Trail

Encounter Layout

Final encounter occurs in a broken ridge amphitheater:

Rough ring of rocks and trees.

Multiple ledges for the Howler to jump between.

A few narrow chokepoints and one open “kill circle”.

Human opponent using ward magic and alchemy.

Traps and corrupted glyphs.

If approached carefully:

Dialogue and potential arrest / negotiated surrender.

Exposure vs Cover-Up

If the player sides with:

Full exposure; Shadow becomes an example.

The Shadow’s “theory”:

May choose a quieter resolution and feed some findings into Restricted Lab.

Fight Design (If Combat)

Arena:

Around a wardstone ring.

Light corruption bleed into area.

Shadow uses:

Short teleport-like repositioning between ward glyphs.

Corruption flares at pre-warded spots.

Implementation Notes
Where These Sit in the Structure

This pack can live as:

B103 – Greatwood Signature Hunts Pack (1–20) in Future/Features, or

Split into per-hunt files referenced by B103 as an index.

Data Model Alignment

Each Hunt maps directly onto the Hunt structure defined in 61:

Contract entry on Hunt Board.

Target archetype.

Trail/encounter/resolution definition.

Each Hunt should:

Reference:

ZCL and pockets from 91.

Lodge circles and rep rewards from 59.

Labs/Warding and projects from B101/B102 (where relevant).

Alchemy recipes and items from 58.

Tuning

Numbers (HP, damage, buff values) are intentionally not specified:

Leave balancing for implementation.

Difficulty target:

Each Signature Hunt should feel:

Substantially harder and more involved than a standard Tier 1 Hunt.

Like an “anchor memory” of Greatwood’s arc.
