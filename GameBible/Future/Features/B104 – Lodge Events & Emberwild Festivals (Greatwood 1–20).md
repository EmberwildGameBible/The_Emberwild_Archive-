# B104 – Lodge Events & Emberwild Festivals (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define Lodge-level events and regional festivals that:

Make the Greatwood Lodge feel like a living community, not just a menu hub.

Give in-world reasons for:

Temporary buffs (XP, rep, loot luck).

Unique contracts and Hunts (61, B103).

Social activities and roleplay.

Integrate with:

Lodge Projects & Structural Upgrades (B102).

Labs & Warding Wing (B101).

Corruption & Cleansing (91).

Alchemy (58).

Personal quarters & identity (B100).

Lodge Circles & Reputation (59).

This is the Greatwood 1–20 slice of events/festivals — the “prototype season” structure.

Core Fantasy

Hunters don’t just:

teleport out, kill a monster, teleport back into emptiness.

They live in a Lodge that:

Celebrates kills and mourns losses.

Holds rituals to push back corruption.

Hosts feasts when big Hunts succeed.

Marks seasonal transitions with lore-rich customs.

The player should feel:

“Sometimes when I come back to the Lodge, things are happening — feasts, ceremonies, rituals, arguments, weird experiments, festival nights.”

Design Pillars

Events Are Diegetic, Not Pop-Up UI Only

You see:

Decorations.

Gathered NPCs.

Soundscapes.

Then the game tells you:

What’s happening.

What you can do.

Low FOMO, High Flavor

Events should be:

Frequent enough that players experience several naturally.

Not so rare that missing one feels punishing.

Boosts are:

Appreciated and thematic.

Not mandatory for progression.

Tied to Systems, Not Bolted On

Every event touches at least one core system:

Hunts, Corruption, Alchemy, Research, Lodge Projects, Reputation.

Scale-Friendly

Greatwood 1–20 uses a small, manageable set:

A few daily-ish “micro” events.

A couple of weekly-ish Lodge events.

One or two “Festival” level arcs.

Framework must scale later to:

Region-wide “seasons”.

Multi-Lodge coordination events.

Event Types Overview

We define three tiers of events:

Micro Events – small, frequent Lodge happenings (ambient + light interaction).

Lodge Events – medium-scale, scheduled or triggered events centered on the Lodge.

Festivals – major celebrations/rituals that change the Lodge for a chunk of time.

1. Micro Events (Ambient Lodge Life)

Better wards → fewer/harder events? (tune as needed).

Or easier baseline.

Social/Culture projects:

Make Feast more elaborate:

More décor.

More NPC participation.

Improve micro event frequency in common rooms.

With B101 – Labs & Wards

Research Gallery:

Supports Scholar’s Exhibition events.

Scholar Exhibition → Scholars.

Hunt Reckoning → Huntmasters.

Some events:

Hunt Reckoning:

Specifically references:

Recent Signature Hunts from B103.

Once every few in-game days or after sets of milestones.

Festivals:

Ember Feast:

1–2 times during player’s 1–20 arc (depending on pacing).

Gloaming Vigil:

1 major Vigil threading the end of Greatwood.

Per-player feel:

By level 20, a typical player should have:

Seen:

Several micro events.

Multiple Lodge Events.

At least one Feast and one Vigil (barring wildly unusual play).

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

The B104 structure should later support:

Region-specific Festivals:

Coastal Lodges: Stormwatch Rites.

Desert Lodges: Sandfire Nights.

Seasonal/Live “Season” Content:

Rotating Lodge event arcs with:

Unique cosmetics.

Limited-time Hunts.

Inter-Lodge Politics Events:

All expansions should still resemble:

Named, structured events that exist in the world and hook into systems — not floating menus.
