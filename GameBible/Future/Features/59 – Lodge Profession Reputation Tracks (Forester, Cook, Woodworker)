59 – Lodge Reputation, Hunt Board, and Contracts (Greatwood 1–20)
Purpose

Define how the Lodge functions as:

The player’s main hub of progression.

The source of structured Hunt Contracts.

A network of reputation tracks that:

Pay out unique rewards.

Unlock systems like Alchemy (58), Corruption work (91), and Professions (95).

Reflect how the Emberwild responds to the hunter’s actions.

This is the Greatwood 1–20 slice of Lodge Reputation and the Hunt Board. It must be:

Immediately usable.

Systemically connected to Hunts, Corruption, and Alchemy.

Ready to expand later without needing a redesign.

Design Pillars

The Lodge Is Home, Not Just a Menu

Reputation, contracts, and rewards are tied to:

Physical rooms.

NPCs.

Rituals and ceremonies.

The player should feel like they are part of an organization, not a quest terminal.

One Simple Loop, Many Layers

Core loop:

Take contract → prepare → hunt → return → turn in → rank up.

Around this loop:

Corruption levels change.

NPCs react.

New systems unlock.

Reputation as Story and Power

Reputation unlocks:

Mechanical upgrades (discounts, recipes, access).

Narrative beats (titles, honors, politics).

The path of progression tells the story of:

A hunter rising from newcomer to trusted operative.

Expandable Structure

The Greatwood Lodge is a template.

Future Lodges, outposts, and factions can reuse:

The rep track structure.

The contract types.

The UI patterns.

Components Overview

Lodge Circles – internal “factions” within the Lodge.

Reputation Tracks – numeric reputation levels with thresholds and titles.

Hunt Board – the physical and UI representation of contracts.

Contract Types – hunts, corruption jobs, supply runs, research tasks, social favors.

Rewards & Unlocks – what players get and when.

Progression & Tuning – how fast it moves and how it interacts with other systems.

Lodge Circles (Internal Factions)

The Greatwood Lodge has three primary circles plus a general track:

The Lodge Proper

The overall organization, leadership, and infrastructure.

Represents the hunter’s standing “with the Lodge as a whole.”

Governs:

Access to new regions.

Training.

Lodge-wide amenities.

The Huntmasters’ Circle

Veteran hunters overseeing contracts and combat training.

Governs:

High-risk hunt access.

Combat perks.

Elite gear contracts.

The Wardens’ Circle

The protectors of the bounds and wards against Corruption.

Governs:

Corruption-focused contracts (91).

Cleansing rituals.

Warding-related rewards.

The Scholars’ Circle

Researchers, alchemists, and lorekeepers.

Governs:

Alchemy (58).

Professions and research tasks (95).

Lore and exploration bonuses.

Each circle has its own Reputation Track but the player also has:

A Lodge Rank that is a weighted combination of all four.

Reputation Tracks
Structure

Each circle’s reputation is a numeric value, e.g. 0–10,000 in Greatwood.

We define five ranks for each circle:

Rank 0: Outsider

Rank 1: Recognized

Rank 2: Proven

Rank 3: Trusted

Rank 4: Pillar

Greatwood 1–20 is expected to move the player from:

Rank 0 → Rank 3 in at least one circle.

Rank 1–2 in others, depending on playstyle.

Lodge Proper – Rank Names (Example)

0: Guest of the Lodge

1: Pledged Hunter

2: Bound Hunter

3: Sworn Ember

4: Warden of the Hall (beyond Greatwood, more aspirational)

Huntmasters, Wardens, and Scholars can have similar rank naming but tuned to their flavor.

Gaining Reputation

Players earn reputation with circles via:

Contracts

Completing contracts from the Hunt Board:

Hunts → Huntmasters and Lodge Proper.

Corruption and warding contracts → Wardens and Lodge Proper.

Research and supply tasks → Scholars and Lodge Proper.

Story Quests

Big story beats often give:

Lodge Proper rep.

One circle’s rep in bulk.

Donations / Projects

Contributing:

Rare reagents.

Crafted items.

Corruption samples.

Gains small but repeatable rep, possibly with diminishing returns.

Behavior Flags

Sparing or slaying certain creatures.

Sparing corrupted NPCs.

Choosing dialogue options that align with a circle’s philosophy.

These are minor adjustments, mostly narrative color.

The Hunt Board
Physical Presentation

A large board or wall in a Lodge hall:

Plastered with:

Papers.

Ribbons.

Wax-sealed orders.

NPCs gather around to argue about contracts.

Player interacts with:

The board itself.

Or a nearby Huntmaster NPC who “reads” the board for them.

(Later) Special and Timed Events

Each contract card displays:

UI and Feedback
In Lodge

Markers that show contract relevance.

Failure, Abandonment, and Reputation Loss

Abandoning a contract:

No rep gained.

Small rep hit with the offering circle if repeated.

Failing a contract (e.g., a target escapes or timer expires):

Possible minor rep loss, depending on context.

Some story contracts:

May change narrative outcomes instead of pure rep loss.

Rare.

Mostly tied to narrative events or repeated negligence.

Future Hooks Beyond Greatwood

The Greatwood Lodge framework needs to scale to:

Multiple Lodges in different regions.

A global “Hunter Rank” that other NPCs recognize.

Future expansions may add:

Competing hunter companies.

Political choices:

Siding with one circle over another.

Season-style systems:

Regional corruption events.

All of these reuse the base structure defined here: circles, rep, Hunt Board, contracts, rewards.
