# 59 – Lodge Profession Reputation Tracks (Forester, Cook, Woodworker)

## Purpose

Define **micro-reputation tracks** inside the Lodge for key professions:

- **Forester’s Circle** (Foresters / Wood-gatherers)
- **Ember Kitchen** (Cooks)
- **Carpenter’s Hall** (Woodworkers)

These tracks:

- Give professions a **social identity** inside the Lodge
- Reward players for doing profession-related tasks
- Unlock profession tools/gear (54) and recipes (52, 53, 57)

This is a design spec for **rep structure and rewards**, not code.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Low-friction progression**  
   Players gain rep just by doing the profession stuff they already want to do (turn-ins, quests, deliveries).

2. **Clear fantasy**  
   Each wing feels different:  
   - Forester’s Circle = trees, survey, pathfinding  
   - Ember Kitchen = cooking, supply, morale  
   - Carpenter’s Hall = crafting structures, tools, finer work

3. **Small, meaningful rewards**  
   Unlocks: recipes, tools, cosmetics, small perks. No mandatory “you must grind this” for core power.

4. **Extendable**  
   Start with 3 wings now, but leave room for new ones later (Fletcher, Tanners, Alchemists, etc.).

---

## Basic Rep Track Structure

For each profession wing:

- **Rep Name:** e.g. Ember Kitchen Reputation
- **Ranks (5 total):**
  1. Stranger
  2. Known Hand
  3. Trusted Hand
  4. Pillar
  5. Keeper (or equivalent)
- **Rep Points:** simple numeric scale (e.g. 0–1000 per wing, tuning later)
- **Sources of Rep:**
  - Daily / repeatable turn-ins
  - One-time quests and story beats
  - Profession tasks (craft X, deliver Y)

## Shared Rep Rules

- **Separate tracks**: each wing has its own bar & ranks.
- **Soft cross-talk**:
  - Some tasks might give small amounts to multiple wings (e.g. big Lodge project uses wood + food).
- **Caps**:
  - Rank 5 should be difficult but not insane for a dedicated profession player.

---

## Integration

- Forester gear & tasks link to:
  - Tracking, field events, Greatwood environment
- Ember Kitchen links to:
  - Cooking systems (52, 53, 56)
- Carpenter’s Hall links to:
  - Woodworking, combo crafts (57), camp upgrades

---

## Next Actions

- Nail exact rep numbers and thresholds.
- Assign concrete turn-in items with IDs and amounts.
- Design 1–2 small “rep intro” quests for each wing to formally enroll the player.
