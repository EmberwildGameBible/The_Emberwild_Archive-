# EMBERWILD CULTURE PACK (V2 — FINAL TONE)

*Grounded. No folksy bullshit. No mystical metaphors. No cheesy frontier proverbs. Just people living in a rough world.*

---

# **1. HOW PEOPLE TALK (REGIONAL VOICES)**

Not accents.

Not poetry.

Just differences in attitude and vocabulary.

### **Heartlands**

Straightforward, practical, neutral tone.

- “Road’s clear enough.”
- “We’ll find out when we get there.”
- “If it looks off, it probably is.”

They keep conversation short and functional.

### **Highlands**

Blunt. Dry humor. Few wasted words.

- “Path’s bad.”
- “Weather’s turning.”
- “Tie your gear. Last thing we need is to climb back down for your pack.”

They speak like people used to danger and don’t dramatize it.

### **Greatwood**

Calm, observant, slightly cautious.

- “Stay close. The ground can be uneven.”
- “Don’t wander. Easy to lose your direction in here.”
- “If you hear something, stop. Don’t try to guess what it is.”

Not mystical — just practical forest experience.

### **Marshfolk**

Straight shooters. No riddles. No mystical fog-talk.

- “Watch your step. Some ground’s soft.”
- “If the water’s still, move slow.”
- “Things hide in the reeds. Don’t make noise.”

They say what they mean.

### **Shattercoast**

Direct, confident, used to danger.

- “Storm’s coming in early.”
- “We leave at dawn or don’t leave.”
- “Ship’s sound, but don’t push it.”

They talk like sailors, not sea-poets.

---

# **2. SUPERSTITIONS (GROUNDED, NOT MAGICAL)**

Things people believe because experience taught them — not cosmic nonsense.

### **General**

- Don’t sleep near warm ground. Vents shift at night.
- Don’t travel alone past dusk unless you know the route.
- If the air goes quiet, stop and listen. Something moved.

### **Heartlands**

- Keep tools near the door during tremor season.
- Don’t trust abandoned wells.

### **Highlands**

- Don’t climb after a fresh snowfall. Slips happen.
- If stone cracks under you, freeze — don’t run.

### **Greatwood**

- Don’t eat berries you didn’t pick.
- Camp only where others have camped before.

### **Marshfolk**

- Test every patch of ground with a stick first.
- If you smell rot and hear nothing, back away slowly.

### **Shattercoast**

- Don’t set sail if the wind drops dead.
- Keep one hand free near the rail.

Not poetic. Not mystical. Just habits that keep people alive.

# **3. CHILDREN’S RHYMES (REALISTIC, PRACTICAL)**

Short and simple — not metaphorical.

### **Heartland rhyme**

> “Check the ground,
> 
> 
> Check the door,
> 
> Tell someone
> 
> Before you go.”
> 

### **Highland rhyme**

> “Step on rock,
> 
> 
> Step with care.
> 
> Loose stone falls,
> 
> Don’t stand there.”
> 

### **Greatwood rhyme**

> “Stay on the path,
> 
> 
> Stay where it’s clear.
> 
> Don’t run ahead,
> 
> I won’t find you here.”
> 

### **Marshfolk rhyme**

> “Stick to the dry,
> 
> 
> Step where it’s brown.
> 
> If you see water,
> 
> Slow yourself down.”
> 

### **Shattercoast rhyme**

> “Hold the rail,
> 
> 
> Watch the wave.
> 
> Storms don’t wait,
> 
> So learn the way.”
> 

These feel like real parents teaching real kids basic safety.

# **5. FESTIVALS & TRADITIONS (NO MYTHOLOGY)**

Locals celebrate or prepare based on real needs.

### **Heartlands — “Clear Day”**

After the first big tremor of the year, people check buildings, tools, and supplies.

Not a festival — more like a community maintenance day.

### **Highlands — “Last Climb”**

Before winter gets dangerous, climbers make one final supply run.

A practical tradition.

### **Greatwood — “Marking Day”**

Families repaint or re-carve path markers deeper in the woods.

It keeps people from getting lost.

### **Marshfolk — “Dry Step”**

A day when everyone inspects walkways, docks, and raised paths.

No mysticism — just preparation.

### **Shattercoast — “Stormstart”**

Before storm season, ships get checked stem to stern.

Everyone helps.

---

# **6. MEASUREMENTS, TIME & NAMING (ALL PRACTICAL)**

No mystical units.

### **Measurements**

- “A short walk”
- “Half a day out”
- “Two hills over”
- “A ridge’s distance”
- “Arm’s depth” (shallow water)

### **Time**

- first light
- late light
- high sun
- last sun
- after-dark
- deep-night

### **Naming**

People name things after:

- terrain (“Cliffbend”)
- events (“Splitwater”)
- families (“Harrow’s Post”)
- accidents (“Fallridge”)
    
    Not poetic, just descriptive.

# **7. MINOR NPCS (REAL PEOPLE — NOT ARCHETYPES)**

### **Tava Helin (Heartlands courier)**

Talks fast, tired eyes, hates long roads.

“Long trip. If you’re headed that way, bring water.”

### **Erren of Greypeak (Highlander)**

Dry, sarcastic, practical.

“Don’t go up there today. Snow’s wrong.”

### **Evi (Marshfolk herb-collector)**

Quiet, observant.

“Step where I step. Don’t guess.”

### **Weller Fleet-Tooth (Shattercoast sailor)**

Confident, blunt.

“Ship’s ready. Weather isn’t. Pick one.”

### **Sairen Lowlilt (Greatwood guide)**

Soft-spoken but no-nonsense.

“Stay close. Don’t drift off.”

No magic talking, no mystical insight. Just grounded people.

---

# **8. CULTURAL FRICTION (REAL, GROUNDED)**

### Highlanders vs Heartlanders

Highlanders think Heartlanders worry too much.

Heartlanders think Highlanders don’t worry enough.

### Marshfolk vs Greatwood

Marshfolk think forest paths are confusing.

Greatwood folk think marshes are unpredictable.

Both are correct.

### Shattercoast vs Everyone

Sailors think inlanders can’t handle risk.

Inlanders think sailors take too many risks.

### Emberforge vs Greatwood

Miners want resources.

Forestfolk want caution.

This creates tension without melodrama.

---

# **9. MULTIPLE EMBERFALL BELIEFS (NO MYTHOS)**

Just different theories — like real people disagreeing.

### Heartlands

“It was pressure underground. Nothing mystical.”

### Highlands

“Old tunnels collapsed. Should’ve stayed sealed.”

### Greatwood

“Something broke the ground open. No idea what.”

### Marshfolk

“Heat rose fast and spread through the soil.”

### Shattercoast

“Currents changed. Sea pulled at the coast.”

No factions think it’s a prophecy or god event.

Just different guesses.

---

# **10. MYSTERIES (NOT SUPERNATURAL, JUST UNEXPLAINED)**

These are geological or biological anomalies — not magic spirits.

- Why do some vents warm and cool randomly?
- Why do some creatures avoid fissures entirely?
- Why do certain regions tremor at matching times?
- Why do underground caverns form perfect arches?
- Why do some ember-scar areas glow faintly at night?

These add intrigue without fantasy mysticism.

# *THIS IS NOW THE FINAL TONE.

Everything we write going forward will use THIS.**

No magic metaphors.

No folksy rhymes.

No Disney fairytale language.

No Skyrim peasant curses.

No Elden Ring poetic despair.

No “wise old woods.”

No “whimsical folklore.”

No “don’t trust the fog” shit.

Just REAL PEOPLE in a hard world.
