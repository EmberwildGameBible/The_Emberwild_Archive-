# 2026-01-04 — Greatwood Whisperline Lv1-10 Overview

## Pitch (<=10 lines)
- A narrow trade road through sap-thick woods where whispers carry contracts and warnings.
- Wardens try to keep smugglers from cutting wards loose to skirt tolls.
- Sap-magic wards hum around cairns; folk songs give away safe turns.
- Travel is slow: wet timber, rope bridges, and mule trains set the pace.
- Vendors matter because resupply is distant and ward chalk wears fast.
- Early dungeons: a smugglers' side knot and an old warded vault buried in roots.
- Crafting leans on sap, bark, and shroom teas to keep lanterns burning.
- Faction tension: Wardens, Smuggler Crews, and Cairnkeepers.
- Loot is practical: bandages, buckles, torches, satchels, and travel papers.
- Rumors, artifacts, and quests keep the road feeling watched from the trees.

## Level Bands & Loops
### Levels 1–3: Road Initiates
- Escort mule trains between **Sapstring Crossing** and **Whisperline Milepost**.
- Clear vermin at **Lowlight Shroom Beds** and gather **Lowlight Shroom Tea** ingredients.
- Turn in ward-chalk requests to **Cairnkeeper Sura** to maintain the **Murmur Wardstone**.
- Vendors: **Warden Quartermaster Ellas** and **Cook Mara of the Crossing** sell bandages, teas, and torches.
- Loop rewards: **Sapstring Bandage**, **Whisperline Travel Ration**, **Chorus Bridge Torch**.

### Levels 4–6: Roadkeepers & Smugglers

- Scout **Resin Tangle** for sap and bark to craft **Resin Patch Kits** and **Ward-Chalk Packets**.

## Travel Friction
- Roads are muddy; only partial carts fit through **Chorus Bridge**; speed reductions apply.
- Wardstones hum; entering forests without chalk drains stamina faster.
- Hostile pockets at **Bracken Snare Ring** and **Smuggler's Knot Camp** pull wanderers off-road.
- River crossings at **Fallen Cart Bend** slow mounts; bridges require torchlight at night.

## Factions & Rep Unlocks
- **Whisperline Wardens**: Escort tasks and ward upkeep; rep unlocks better bandages and buckles.
- **Smuggler Crews**: Contraband deliveries and rumor trading; rep unlocks covert permits and hooks.
- **Cairnkeepers**: Root-song rituals and wardstone repairs; rep unlocks listening tools and charms.
