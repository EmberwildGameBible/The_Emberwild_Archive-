# 2026-01-04 — Greatwood Whisperline Lv10-20 Bridge Plan

## Sub-Area Outlines
- **Sapsong Heights**: Elevated ropewalks above the Whisperline road; rope bridges sway; new wind hazards.
- **Briarfall Wash**: Waterlogged gullies where wardstones sank; mudslides expose old smuggler caches.
- **Elderroot Galleries**: Hollowed root tunnels humming with old ward songs; cairnkeepers guard secrets.
- **Mirebound Ferry Spur**: Side spur to ferry piers that shortcuts to Frostbriar caravans but draws smugglers.

## Future Quest Chains (Outline)
1. **Wardens' Retaliation**
   - Investigate sabotage at **Whisperline Milepost** waystones.
   - Recover stolen **Ward-Chalk Packet** crates from **Briarfall Wash**.
   - Escort replacement stones to **Sapsong Heights** while under ranged pressure.
2. **Smugglers' Counterplay**
   - Track coded songs carried by **Milepost Whisperer** to hidden caches.
   - Plant false route permits in **Elderroot Galleries** to mislead wardens.
   - Negotiate with **Roadling Fen** to smuggle repairs that favor smugglers.
3. **Cairnkeepers' Vigil**
   - Collect root-song fragments from **Elderroot Galleries**.
   - Cleanse flooded wardstones in **Briarfall Wash**.
   - Re-align the **Murmur Wardstone** chant to unlock a deeper vault door.

## Future Dungeon Idea
- **The Drowned Cairn** (Lv16–18)
  - Entry requires combined ward tokens from Wardens and Cairnkeepers.
  - Rooms alternate between submerged tunnels and echo chambers that scramble shouts.
  - Bosses revolve around shattering unstable wards and managing sap tides.
  - Loot favors improved ward tools and contraband ferries seeking shortcuts.

## Faction Evolutions
- **Whisperline Wardens**: Gain siege kits and rope-tension gear; reputation unlocks emergency bridge repairs and faster escorts.
- **Smuggler Crews**: Begin running ferries through **Mirebound Ferry Spur**; reputation unlocks hidden ferrymarks and damp-proof satchels.
- **Cairnkeepers**: Expand root-song teachings; reputation unlocks layered wardstones and bonus charms against echo effects.

## Hooks Forward
- Tie new recipes to wind-safe ropes and sap-drying kits.
- Seed rumors about **The Drowned Cairn** with merchants planning ferries.
- Extend vendor rotations so Roadling Fen carries ferry-proof crates.
