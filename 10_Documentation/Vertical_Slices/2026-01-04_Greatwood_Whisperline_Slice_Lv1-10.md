# Greatwood Whisperline Slice (Levels 1–10)

## Slice Pitch
1. Patrol a whispering forest trade-route where sap-magic and smuggled permits collide.
2. Choose between lodge wardens and root-sung couriers to shape the route's trust.
3. Hum along ancient root-songs to calm wards or twist them to jam patrol horns.
4. Harvest glowing sap pools to craft chalk wards that expose hidden caches.
5. Escort sap trains across misted fords while smugglers mirror echoes to mislead you.
6. Uncover ledgers that prove who steals shrine offerings and who keeps roads lit.
7. Sneak through Hollow Verge tar pits or fortify Stonebridge to lock the road.
8. Descend into the Rootbound Vault to silence a chorus that calls smugglers home.
9. Trade with sap-focused vendors to craft resin tonics and warding charms.
10. Weave artifacts, rumors, and quests into one loop that feels playable from level 1.
