# The Emberwild Archive

## How to navigate
- **00_MASTER_INDEX**: Entry point. Each index links to the detailed chapters in the repo.
- **01_World / 02_Regions**: Macro worldbuilding—continents, factions, travel, and zone progression.
- **03_Lore**: Cosmology, creature families, and foundational concepts.
- **04_Writings**: In-world fiction and narrative artifacts.
- **05_Classes**: Class compendiums and kits.
- **06_Systems**: Gameplay systems (crafting, mounts, progression).
- **07_Quests / 08_Items**: Quest structures, reward tables, and itemization.
- **10_Documentation**: Meta docs and support material.

## Using the indexes
1. Open the relevant index in `00_MASTER_INDEX`.
2. Follow the links to the chapter files; each entry should eventually include a short synopsis and a status tag.
3. Leave notes in the index next to entries you draft or expand so progress is visible.

## Classic-style design goals
- **Distinct class identities**: Resource pacing (rage, energy, mana), clear talent ladders, and role specialization.
- **Zone progression**: Level bands per region with hub-to-hub quest flows and dungeon entry points.
- **Attunements and epics**: Multi-step chains for mounts, weapons, and profession unlocks.
- **Economy depth**: Gathering routes, profession specializations, and crafted pre-raid gear.

## Contributing
- Prefer short, linked chapters over giant monoliths.
- Add a status note (Draft/Playable/Final) to index entries when you touch a file.
