# Forgepost Freight Ledger
- Steward Raxa initials every crate of Pyre Quiver shafts and Oathbound Chisel blanks stacked by the ash gate.
- Side tally notes a missing Opal Arrow bundle diverted toward the [Ashen Cry Grotto Quests](../07_Quests/Dungeon/Ashen_Cry_Grotto_Quests.md) pit crew.
- Red sand stamped next to a Quill Quiver slot hints at a smuggler from [Thornlash Palisade](../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md).
- Lead: ledger tags a sealed chest for “stormcallers only” with Quickmire Oil warnings.
