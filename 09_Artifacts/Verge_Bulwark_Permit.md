- Quartermaster Ell issues this to storm scouts drawing Kindled Yarn wraps and Jetstone Charm focus pieces.
- States that Lantern Cowl hoods must be returned after the next [Shattered Verge Map Stitch](../07_Quests/NPC_SHOPS_AND_INVENTORIES.md) update.
- Margin notes a delivery to [Ashen Cry Grotto Quests](../07_Quests/Dungeon/Ashen_Cry_Grotto_Quests.md) for hazard testing.
