# 2026-01-04 SIGMA Whisperline Artifact 23

[Archivist note found near Whisperline Stonebridge]

Sap stains on this page came from a **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Sap Flake** trade; Neral says it buys one night of mercy.
Rootlines under Whisperline Stonebridge beat slow; step wrong and the barkmail packs surface before the wards dim.

Bring this note back to the shrine if the echo turns cold; Syl will know the pitch is wrong.
