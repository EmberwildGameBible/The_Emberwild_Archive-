# 2026-01-04 SIGMA Whisperline Artifact 52

[Driftcart peddler note found near Mirebreath Run]
I logged the silence barkmail scouts because Sapbroker Neral said the songs were drifting again.
The Greatwood Wardens think they own the chorus, but Lia Corrin's smugglers hum back with wrong pitches to blind patrol horns.
Sap stains on this page came from a **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Sap Flake** trade; Neral says it buys one night of mercy.
Rootlines under Mirebreath Run beat slow; step wrong and the barkmail packs surface before the wards dim.
Peddler Yim scratched a map on the margin pointing toward the Rootbound Vault mouth when the Sapswell glows.
If you carry a **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Ward Token** the bridge guards wave you by—everyone else pays twice.
Bring this note back to the shrine if the echo turns cold; Syl will know the pitch is wrong.
