# Slidecaller Field Note

Windbreak rope steward Briala scratched this into a damp ledger scrap after a night run.

- "Relay harness kept my ribs intact when the bridge lurched."
- "Glimmerdeep hood beads glowed amber when vents thinned—signal works."
- "Crampons bit into ash-ice; Skitters hated that screech."
