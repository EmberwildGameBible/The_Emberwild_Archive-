# Saltmarrow Tide Rumor Slip

Dockhand chalk scribble pinned to a soaked piling.
- Claims the tidecourt clerk lost the [Tidewrit Seal](../08_Items/Trinkets/Saltmarrow_Tidewrit_Seal.md) after a ferry duel noted in [Strandline Courier Loop](../07_Quests/Strandline_Courier_Loop.md).
- Says the seal only surfaces when the shoal boss is harpooned during the world-boss tide window in [World Boss & Elite Drop Notes](../06_Systems/Dungeons/World_Boss_Loot.md).
- Points collectors to pay debts recorded in the matching ledger tab before bargaining.
