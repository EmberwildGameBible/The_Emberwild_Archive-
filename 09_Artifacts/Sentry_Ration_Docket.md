# Sentry Ration Docket

Folded stack of salt-stained ration slips pinned beside the gate at [Thornlash Palisade](../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md).
- Origin: Copied nightly by the bunk sergeant from Marrowhook freight tallies so Slidecaller crews stop fighting over supper.
- Cultural tie: Sentries stamp their clan or crew mark beside each ration line; extra notches mean someone skimmed the crate.
- Gameplay hook: Each unchecked line adds a hidden smuggler cache to the [Thornlash Palisade Duties](../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md) rotation.
- Lines: “Brine bricks 12 — short by 2 (blue stamp). Resin jars 6 — crack at lid (red). Prowler pelts 4 — held for grip resin.”
- Lead: Points players toward missing crates that could hide [Thornlash Sentry Wristwraps](../08_Items/Gear/Thornlash_Sentry_Wristwraps.md) upgrades or [Marrowhook Ledger Dockets](Marrowhook_Ledger_Dockets.md).
