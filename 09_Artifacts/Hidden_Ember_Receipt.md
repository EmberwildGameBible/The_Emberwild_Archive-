# Hidden Ember Receipt
- Nale scribbled this under a lantern, listing Stormweld Blade swaps and Ravenholt Charm pawns.
- Stamp shows Silent Bell tithe paid, but the Tideborn Gauntlet crate is circled twice.
- A side note tells the buyer to meet at the [Mire Salvage Chain](../07_Quests/Mire_Salvage_Chain.md) rope winch.
- Bottom line says “deliver to [Thornlash Palisade](../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md) northwatch, ask for black-band scout.”
- Lead: receipt hints at another box of Thornlit Elixir hidden in a coal bin.
