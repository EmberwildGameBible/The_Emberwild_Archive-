# Shatterglass Oathkeeper Ledger

Silver-inked ledger kept by the Crypt Judge’s aides.
- Notes when the [Shatterglass Oathmirror](../08_Items/Trinkets/Shatterglass_Oathmirror.md) may be awarded; only after the judge is silenced mid-curse as captured in [Shatterglass Crypt Loot Tables](../06_Systems/Dungeons/Shatterglass_Crypt/Loot_Tables.md).
- Required to prove intent during the "Oathmirror" quest capstone in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Signed by Oathkeeper Lorn with mirrored wax.
