# Thornlash Warning Slate

Slate hung by the rope bridge at [Thornlash Palisade](../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md), chalked by Slidecaller lookouts and smudged by tea steam.
- Origin: Copied from old ferry tide boards after ash drifts started tearing rails.
- Cultural tie: Each guild uses different chalk colors — blue for Marrowhook salt crews, red for Slidecallers tallying bell runs.
- Gameplay hook: Players can roll weather dice here to set ash drift strength before starting patrol quests.
- Lines: “Gust 3/6 — tie down sled rails; prowler prints near sandbag row. Vent stink at dusk; bring extra resin.”
- Lead: Brings you to the wall to trigger [Thornlash Palisade Duties](../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md) and hunt [Thornlash Prowlers](../03_Lore/Creatures/Thornlash_Prowler.md) for pelts.
