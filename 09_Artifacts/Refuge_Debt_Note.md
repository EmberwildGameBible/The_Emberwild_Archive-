- Scholar Lira’s neat script lists unpaid deposits for Emberglass Wand studies and Hearth Map copies.
- A scribble says “deliver Barley Snack Pack to the child hiding behind stack #3.”
- Footer references the [Strandline Courier Loop](../07_Quests/Strandline_Courier_Loop.md) for returning overdue scroll bundles.
- Side margin: frost smear implies someone fled toward the [Old Road Circuit](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md) with a Drift Elixir vial.
- Lead: folded corner hides a glyph pointing to a locked crate of Greatwood Arrow diagrams in the rear alcove.
