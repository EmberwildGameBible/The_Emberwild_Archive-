# Hollowroot Matriarch Rumor Slip

Spore-smeared scrap traded between tunnel scouts.
- Claims the [Mycelial Matriarch's Mantle](../08_Items/Gear/Hollowroot_Mycelial_Mantle.md) only drops when the Warren Matriarch is soothed with glowcaps during hard mode in [Hollowroot Warren](../06_Systems/Dungeons/Hollowroot_Warren/Loot_Tables.md).
- Directs healers to carry the birthing ledger page to start "Matriarch’s Oath" in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Notes that surface traders are paying extra for sporecloth cloaks.
