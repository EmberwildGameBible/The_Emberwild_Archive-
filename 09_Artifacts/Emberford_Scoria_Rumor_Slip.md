# Emberford Scoria Rumor Slip

A smelter hand scrawled this on slag-paper, left on the Marketwalk winch house bench.
- "Redflare Leviathan keeps circling the vent buoys. Whoever carries that [Scoria-Draw Harpoon](../08_Items/Gear/Emberford_Scoria-Draw_Harpoon.md) will get first strike."
- Mentions the permit runner waiting near the ferry turnstile; ties to the "Scoria Draw" steps in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Points at Windbreak Post crews logging heat spikes per the new [World Boss drop callouts](../06_Systems/Dungeons/World_Boss_Loot.md).
