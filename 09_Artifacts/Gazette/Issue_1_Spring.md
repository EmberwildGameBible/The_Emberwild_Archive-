# Emberford Marketwalk Gazette — Issue 1 (Spring)

## Short Notices
1. Ferry delays expected at dawn; Mayor Halda Brine requests anyone with an [Aegis of Amberwake](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-001) help shore up the quay rails.
2. Lost trinket: a [Dawnstar Talisman](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-008) on a leather cord; reward posted at the shrine desk.
3. Cookoff tonight—bring [Barley Snack Packs](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-004) or a fresh [Cinderbrew Flask](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-006) for tasting.
4. Escorts wanted for Riverlight Delta trip; see Ril about smuggler marks carved into an [Ashen Pike](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-002).

## Longer Columns
### Smoke Over the Kilns
Ril reports that kiln chimneys are burning hotter than usual, and the ash patterns match runes etched into the [Cinderbrew Flask](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-006). Kiln workers whisper that the soot points toward the old shrine line on the river bend. Anyone joining the **Kiln Soot Samples** run from the [Quest Hub](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Quest_Hub.md) should carry spare water skins and copy any sigils before cleaning them.

### Ledger Lines and Ferry Lines
Ressa’s battered ledger shows debts linked to both [Brood Yarn](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-024) bolts and crates of [Bramble Apple](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-025). The **Marketwalk Ledger** quest pays players who reconcile accounts without bloodshed; extra favor is granted for returning any [Kiln-Scored Ledger Clip](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Quest_Hub.md#artifacts-circulating-through-the-hub) she’s missing.

### The Silent Bell Question
Archivist Torlen insists the [Band of the Blue Stream](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-003) must sit beside the [Silent Bell Clapper](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Quest_Hub.md#artifacts-circulating-through-the-hub) to call the river spirits. Mayor Halda fears ringing it will summon trouble. Adventurers who dive for the band in Stream caves can decide: ring the bell to trigger a raid defense, or leave it silent for stealth routes. Either way, the Marketwalk Gazette wants first-hand reports.

### Night Ferry Gossip
Night ferries ride with lowered lamps, hooded by the [Ferryfire Lantern Hood](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Quest_Hub.md#artifacts-circulating-through-the-hub) to avoid attracting sprite swarms. Passengers swear the hood flickers toward anyone wearing a [Dawnstar Talisman](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-008). If you board with one, expect whispered questions about the [Quest Hub](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Quest_Hub.md) and whether the Silent Bell will ever ring.

### Dockside Ledger — Elder Jerky Cuts {#dockside-ledger--elder-jerky-cuts}
- Quartermaster Lysa Veil logged three bundles of [Elder Jerky](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-044) stamped by Glassfields reedwalkers; earmarked for night ferries only.
- Mayor Halda Brine wants the peppered ends reserved for kiln crew escorts running the [Quest Hub](../../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Quest_Hub.md) patrol loop.
- Deckhand Ril claims chewing a strip keeps the Silent Bell’s chill off; he’ll swap shardpepper flakes for any spare bundle.
- Pilgrims bound for the riverside shrine pay double if the jerky was cured near the reedwalkers’ salt pools.
- Ledger note: bundles dipped in [Bramble Oil](../../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md#item-019) fetch better prices from river smugglers but grease the page margins.
- Leave a strip at the dock bell before midnight; rumor says the ferries dock smoother when the offering smokes.
