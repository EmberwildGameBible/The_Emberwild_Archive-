# Thornlash Banner Rumor Slip

Tar-smudged note wedged into the palisade notice board.
- Claims the [Bastion Banner](../08_Items/Gear/Thornlash_Bastion_Banner.md) is awarded only after repelling a dual-front assault triggered in [World Boss & Elite Drop Notes](../06_Systems/Dungeons/World_Boss_Loot.md).
- Mentions quartermaster Issra demanding the banner permit during "Bastion Banner" in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Points to ration docket stamps as proof of veteran status.
