## Artifacts are small, sharp, and local
Each artifact must:
- Feel like it was written by a person in-world (job, bias, fear, greed).
- Contain ONE usable lead (a name, landmark, date, item, or clan).
- Link to 2 other things (items/quests/regions/factions).
Keep artifacts short: usually 6–16 lines.
