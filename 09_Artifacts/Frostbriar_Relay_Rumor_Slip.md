# Frostbriar Relay Rumor Slip

Slidecaller chalk note left on a sled runner crate.
- Warns that the [Rimebound Relay](../08_Items/Trinkets/Frostbriar_Rimebound_Relay.md) only sings when hung over Gravemark switchbacks during blizzard whistles listed in [World Boss & Elite Drop Notes](../06_Systems/Dungeons/World_Boss_Loot.md).
- Points to the "Rimebound Signal" objectives in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Names courier Lysa as the last bearer before she vanished en route to Thornlash Palisade.
