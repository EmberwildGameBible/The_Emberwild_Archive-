# Windbreak Skyline Rumor Slip

Grease-smudged slip from the lookout tower ledger.
- Notes that the [Skyline Javelin](../08_Items/Gear/Windbreak_Skyline_Javelin.md) drops when the sky-manta world boss is grounded with ropeway anchors per [World Boss & Elite Drop Notes](../06_Systems/Dungeons/World_Boss_Loot.md).
- Points to the "Skyline Run" objectives in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Mentions the pole grease chit as proof you serviced the cables.
