# Beacon Steps Permit
- Tidecaller Pella signs this before releasing Yewbarrow Yarn cords and Zephyr Urn beacons.
- States that Yellowroot Quiver tithes cover beacon oil for one week only.
- Bottom line directs bearers to report sightings to [Kelp Sweep](../07_Quests/Kelp_Sweep.md) crews and [Saltmarrow Ledger Chain](./Saltmarrow_Ledger_Chain.md) keepers.
- Lead: faint wax circle hints at a stash of Sap-Slick Jerkin pads beneath the beacon stairs.
