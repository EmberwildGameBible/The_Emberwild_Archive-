# Gravemark Warning Board

> Slidecaller Toma chalked these notes on the top cairn. Scrawl stays up until the next bell shift.
>
> - Avalanche dice: **5** on the east flank; drop ballast before the third rope bridge.
> - Brake winch squeals at the Lantern Span — swap to spare [Timberline Sled Rails](../08_Items/Gear/Timberline_Sled_Rails.md) from the tinker wagon.
> - Bone token tithe collected by Clan Morryn. Skipping it means no [Windbreak Bounty Board](../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) contracts this week.
> - Glimmerdeep porters report Glowspore haze rising; carry [Hookbite Signal Flares](../08_Items/Gear/Hookbite_Signal_Flares.md) for fog bursts.
> - Gravemark Bullyram seen ramming the mid-span ladders; if you drop it, haul the horns to Frostbriar Reach for rail credit.
> - If ropes sing, backtrack — the buried dead don’t like sprinting feet.
