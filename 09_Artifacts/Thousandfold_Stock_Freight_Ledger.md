# Thousandfold Stock Freight Ledger (Caravan Copy)
- Scribbled by: Frel Voss, Marketwalk freighter keeping score after dusk.
- Lead: Ten sealed crates rerouted from the [Emberford Marketwalk Quest Hub](../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Emberford_Marketwalk_Quest_Hub.md) toward Saltmarrow instead of Gravemark.
- Lead: Ventwatch stamped three bundles "Frostbriar Lantern Fuel" yet the wax smells like [Glowspore Tallow Lure](../08_Items/Fishing/Glowspore_Tallow_Lure.md); check the seals before lighting.
- Lead: Dockyard runner from [Ledger Diver Brief](./Ledger_Diver_Brief.md) prepaid for twenty "Brine-Tight Reels" but only fifteen are on the sheet; five vanished at Bellbay crossing.
- Hook: Claim receipts now to unlock the Thousandfold rosters; latecomers pay double in barter.
- Cross-links: references Marketwalk surplus, Saltmarrow reels, and Ventwatch lantern loads—ties batches together for bidding.
