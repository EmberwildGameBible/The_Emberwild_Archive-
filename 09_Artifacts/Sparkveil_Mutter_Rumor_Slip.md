# Sparkveil Mutter Rumor Slip

Rumor slip traded over a quick ale.
- Notes a crate marked [link](../08_Items/Gear/Emberford_Moltenspark_Recurve.md) tucked where the locals dodge fees.
- Marks the spot along [link](../02_Regions/Emberford_Marketwalk/Emberford_Marketwalk_Quest_Hub.md) the runners swear is never watched.
- Lead: flash this at the market judge to kick off the side route in [link](../07_Quests/Mire_Salvage_Chain.md).
