# Weir Patrol Log

Rumor slip traded over a quick ale.
- Notes a crate marked [link](../08_Items/Gear/Ashen_Tread_Crampons.md) tucked where the locals dodge fees.
- Marks the spot along [link](../02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Overview.md) the runners swear is never watched.
- Lead: flash this at the sledmaster to kick off the side route in [link](../07_Quests/Frostbriar_Trail_Hub.md).
