# Hollow Order Permit

Short note pinned by a rusted tack.
- Notes a crate marked [link](../08_Items/Gear/Frostbite_Warden_Frostvein_Axe.md) tucked where the locals dodge fees.
- Marks the spot along [link](../02_Regions/Gravemark_Switchbacks.md) the runners swear is never watched.
- Lead: flash this at the switchback captain to kick off the side route in [link](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md).
