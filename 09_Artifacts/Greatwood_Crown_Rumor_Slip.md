# Greatwood Crown Rumor Slip

Ink-blotted slip tucked under a lodge bench.
- Says the [Grovekeeper's Crown](../08_Items/Gear/Greatwood_Grovekeepers_Crown.md) was last seen during a riverblessing in [Greatwood](../02_Regions/Greatwood/Greatwood.md).
- Warns that only the stag-spirit world boss listed in [World Boss & Elite Drop Notes](../06_Systems/Dungeons/World_Boss_Loot.md) still carries the untouched circlet.
- Points druids to present the grove permit when starting the "Crown of Rivers" chain in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
