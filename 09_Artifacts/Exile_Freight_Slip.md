# Exile Freight Slip
- Pekk scrawled this on scrap, listing Opal Driftleaf bundles and Pyre Feather charms taken from the storm nets.
- Notes that Quickmire Oil tins will be sold only to crews with [Old Road Circuit](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md) clearance.
- A charcoal X marks the crate bound for [Gravemark Switchbacks](../02_Regions/Gravemark_Switchbacks.md) refugees.
- Lead: margin hints at a hidden Oathbound Zest jar beneath the cliff rope where exiles keep watch.
