# Burrow Market Ledger Tab
- Broker Pell’s ink-stained tab for travelers who bartered Yewbarrow Saddles and Zephyr Urns on credit.
- Notes that the Hollowroot Matron's Warding Band must be returned before the next [Hollowroot Birthing Ledger](./Hollowroot_Birthing_Ledger.md) review.
- Mentions a caravan escort still owes for a Zincroot Elixir batch hauled toward [Glimmerdeep Shore Hub](../07_Quests/Glimmerdeep_Shore_Hub.md).
- Lead: margin arrow points to a hidden sack of Zephyr Cowl spares tucked under the rope bridge.
