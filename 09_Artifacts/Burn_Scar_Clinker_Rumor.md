# Burn Scar Clinker Rumor

Sooted note stuck to a lift post.
- Says the [Clinkerbreaker Cudgel](../08_Items/Gear/Burn_Scar_Clinkerbreaker_Cudgel.md) only drops if the Clinker Colossus is stunned mid-swing as documented in [Burn Scar Descent Loot Tables](../06_Systems/Dungeons/Burn_Scar_Descent/Loot_Tables.md).
- Points to the freight permit needed for the "Clinkerbreaker" run in [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Mentions Ashen Cry crews buying spare slag for lantern plating.
