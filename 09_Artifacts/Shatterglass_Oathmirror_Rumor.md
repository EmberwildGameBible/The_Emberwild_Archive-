# Shatterglass Oathmirror Rumor

Broken shard etched with a vow, traded among cryptwalkers.
- Claims the [Shatterglass Oathmirror](../08_Items/Trinkets/Shatterglass_Oathmirror.md) reveals itself only when the Crypt Judge is interrupted mid-curse per [Shatterglass Crypt Loot Tables](../06_Systems/Dungeons/Shatterglass_Crypt/Loot_Tables.md).
- Ties directly into the "Oathmirror" finale within [Legendary Chains — Pack Emberwild](../07_Quests/Generated_Batches/2025-12-24_Legendary_Chains_Pack.md).
- Names Sere the Mute as witness, citing Silent Bell superstition.
