# Watchtower Debt Note
- Scribbled by Quartermaster Joren and wedged under a cache lid.
- Names three runners who took Ember Talisman charms and Bronzed Quiver refills without logging scrip.
- Threatens to pull their patrol slot on the next [Windbreak Bounty Board](../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) posting.
- Margin note: Hazel Oil stains imply someone hiked toward [Frostbriar Trail Hub](../07_Quests/Frostbriar_Trail_Hub.md) before settling the debt.
- Lead: arrow sketch points to a hidden crate of Dawnlit Cowl spares near the watchfire ladder.
