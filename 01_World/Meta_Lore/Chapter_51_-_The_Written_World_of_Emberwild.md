# CHAPTER 51 — THE WRITTEN WORLD OF EMBERWILD

**Guidelines for Journals, Letters, Logs, Histories, Recipes, Confessions, Tales & Scraps Found Across the Land**

# **51.1 PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER**

This chapter defines how all in-world written works are created, organized, and understood within Emberwild.

It clarifies:

- The kinds of people who write in this world
- The different tones, intelligence levels, and styles
- The materials they write on
- What motivates them to write
- How these writings survive long enough to be found
- How many categories exist
- How to ensure every written piece feels human, grounded, and not like an item tooltip

This is the source-of-truth for how all journals, stories, scraps, letters, and lore writings are made.

# **51.2 THE PHILOSOPHY OF WRITTEN WORKS**

1. Every piece must be written by a person, not a narrator.
No omniscient tone. No world-wide perspective. Each writing is one person’s flawed perspective.
2. The writing must reflect the writer’s education, culture, age, and emotional state.
    - A miner writes differently than a mother.
    - A child writes differently than a priest.
    - A bandit writes differently than a Plains historian.
3. 
4. Nothing is written “for the player.”
These texts exist in the world whether or not a player ever reads them.
5. All writings must have a reason to exist.
People write because something happened:
    - fear
    - love
    - boredom
    - duty
    - tradition
    - grief
    - survival
    - pride
    - guilt
    - obsession
6. 
7. Variety is mandatory.
No repeated tone across multiple pieces.
No template writing.
Every voice is its own person.

# **51.3 WHAT PEOPLE WRITE ON**

Different materials = different styles.

- Scrap paper — quick notes, crude writing
- Old parchment — formal letters, records
- Tree bark — emergency notes, children’s carvings
- Cloth strips — camp messages
- Leather scraps — hunter instructions
- Wall charcoal markings — warnings, confessions, symbols
- Bound journals — long stories, diaries, research
- Tavern tabletops — carved jokes or threats
- Gravestones — short finalities
- Professional ledgers — trades, debts, crimes

# **51.4 STRUCTURAL TYPES OF WRITINGS**

All writings fall into one of the following structural forms:

1. Journals — long-form entries, written over days/months
2. Personal Letters — private, emotional, spontaneous
3. Reports & Ledgers — structured, professional, organized
4. Storybooks — fictional tales written as literature
5. Folktales — passed-down cultural stories
6. Recipes & Manuals — utilitarian, craft-focused
7. Wall carvings / chalk — desperate, crude, urgent
8. Scrap fragments — torn, damaged, partial
9. Confessions — guilt, religion, regrets
10. Enemy chatter — stupid, threatening, childish
11. Children’s writings — drawings, simple words, fears
12. Travel Logs & Field Notes — observational, tired, honest
13. Death entries — final lines before an end
14. Specimen notes — hunter/warden creature observations

“Harrin’s Winter Ledger”

**Descriptive**

“Fragments Found Near the Old Road”

**Poetic, but grounded**

“The Days When the Lantern Burned Low”

**Functional**

“Ledger of Purchases & Losses, Year 14”

**Regional**

“A Swamper’s Guide to Boils & Berries”

**Childlike**

“My Dad Went Into the Woods”

**Threatening**

“What Happens to Thieves”

**Anonymous / disturbing**

“The One Who Watches”

“Marked But Not Yet Missed”

# **51.8 RULES OF REALISM**

Every written piece must follow:

**1.**

**Consistency with material**

- Bad paper = smudges, mistakes
- Carved wood = short messages
- Ink shortage = incomplete sentences

**2.**

**Emotional truth**

A writer must feel like a real person under stress, joy, fear, boredom, or pride.

**3.**

**Purpose**

Every writing must exist for a reason:

- grief
- fear
- duty
- pride
- survival
- boredom
- warning
- love

**4.**

**No perfect grammar**

Unless the writer is specifically educated.

**5.**

**Different handwriting energy**

A tired hunter does NOT write like a wealthy scribe.

**6.**

**Nothing magical**

Even “mysterious” writings must be grounded in human logic.

# **51.9 HOW MANY SHOULD EXIST?**

Emberwild should contain:

- 200–400 writings total
(across all regions)

Each region gets:

- 30–50 pieces
- A mix of every category
- Never repeating the same voice twice
