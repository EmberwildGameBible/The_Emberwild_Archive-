# Smuggler's Knot (Greatwood Whisperline)

## Overview & Entry
- Level: 4–6
- Entry: Follow rope ladders from **Smuggler's Knot Camp**; gate opens with a **Smuggler's Knot Hook**.
- Story: A side tunnel used to dodge tolls; packed with traps and stash crates.

## Rooms (5)
1. **Rope Ladder Drop** — vertical entry with swinging hooks; fall risk.
2. **Hidden Cache Hollow** — scattered crates; some trapped with resin smoke.
3. **Gully Crossways** — narrow crossings over sap streams; torches reduce slip chance.
4. **Contraband Alcove** — stash of **Smudged Route Permits** guarded by smugglers.
5. **Escape Chute** — sloped tunnel leading back to **Fallen Cart Bend**.

## Bosses / Mini-Bosses
1. **Hook Foreman** — Throws hooked ropes; interrupts are key; enrages if players linger.
2. **Ledger Burner** — Uses firepots to destroy evidence; drops extra **Smudged Route Permits** when stopped.
3. **Sap Snare Beast** — Ambush beast coated in sap; slows players; weak to torches.
