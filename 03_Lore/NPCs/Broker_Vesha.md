# Broker_Vesha

**Origin/Provenance:** Former Saltmarrow accountant who shifted to glowspore trading after a barge wreck.

**Cultural Tie:** Keeps wind bells on her wrist to appease Mirefolk ferriers; insists every deal ends with a lantern lit.

**Gameplay Hook:** Vendor for [Glowspore_Tallow_Lure](../../08_Items/Fishing/Glowspore_Tallow_Lure.md) and [Glowspore_Tallow](../../08_Items/Crafting/Glowspore_Tallow.md); starts pole grease and ledger salvage quests when stocked.

**Voice Notes:** “Pay the gleam first, then we argue. No bell, no bargain.”
