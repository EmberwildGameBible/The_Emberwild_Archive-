# Frostbriar_Waykeeper

**Origin/Provenance:** Elk matriarchs that learned to patrol Timberline slides after sappers cleared the ridge.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak herders leave cedar wreaths on antlers to thank them for warning bellows; Marrowhook couriers whisper “waykeeper’s watch” before dawn runs.

**Gameplay Hook:** Rare beast that calms other elk when players use proper calls; hunted for antler resin used in [Briar_Sinew_Binding](../../08_Items/Crafting/Briar_Sinew_Binding.md).

**Classification/Nickname:** “Slide Caller” stag mothers.

**Use/Trophy/Reagent:** Antler resin and hide trim for cold gear.

**Behavior Myth:** Locals say they stomp thrice before a squall hits; truth is they scent cult smoke.

**Hunter Voice:** “She looks you dead-on. If you don’t blow the right call, she’ll scatter the herd and your sled goes with it.”
