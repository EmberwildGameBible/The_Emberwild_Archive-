# Frostbite_Warden

**Origin/Provenance:** Briar golem animated by cult ash and frozen meltwater within Ashen Cry Grotto.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak sappers blame “stone keepers” for lost sleds; cultists call it the gate that tests “ash breath.”

**Gameplay Hook:** Dungeon boss that lashes at players on brittle bridges; drops [Windbreak_Ice_Lantern](../../08_Items/Trinkets/Windbreak_Ice_Lantern.md) and [Briar_Sinew_Binding](../../08_Items/Crafting/Briar_Sinew_Binding.md).

**Classification/Nickname:** “Ice Gate.”

**Use/Trophy/Reagent:** Shards can be used to reinforce sled rails.

**Behavior Myth:** Said to weep meltwater for every sledder who falls; more likely condensation from vent heat.

**Hunter Voice:** “You hear the ice creak, then the briar lashes snap. Keep moving or you’re part of the bridge.”
