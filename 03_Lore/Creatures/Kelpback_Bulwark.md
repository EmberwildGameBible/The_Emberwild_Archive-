# Kelpback Bulwark

- Classification/Nickname: Reefback tortoise locals call “dock walls.”
- Use/Trophy/Reagent: Plates shaved for [Saltmarrow Spined Pole](../../08_Items/Fishing/Saltmarrow_Spined_Pole.md) bands; bile used in [Gnat-Smother Salve](../../08_Items/Crafting/Gnat-Smother_Salve.md).
- Behavior Myth: Elders claim the bulwarks only charge if you whistle off-key; in truth they lunge when lantern glares reflect in their eyes.
- Hunter Voice Snippet:
  - “Spine up and stand firm. If it lowers its head, you step left. If it snorts twice, you’re the one taking the swim.”
  - “Leave the small ones. Hookbite pays for plates thick as drift logs.”
