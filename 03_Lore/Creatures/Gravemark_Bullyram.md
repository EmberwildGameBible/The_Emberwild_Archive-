# Gravemark Bullyram

## Field Summary
- Local Classification: “Gravemark bone-ram” by Frostbriar sledders; scholars note it’s a cairn-fed ram whose horns calcify around burial shards.
- Origin: Herds settled in the cairn stratum after the Frostbriar Overpass collapse, feeding on mineral seepage from the graves.
- Cultural Tie: Frostbriar Slidecaller Guild keeps tally notches from each taken horn as rail-credit markers, turning the beast into a rite-of-passage hunt.
- Gameplay Hook: Mid-20s elite spawn along the Gravemark Switchbacks; drops **Cairn-Spiked Horns** used in crafting [Aegis of Amberwake](../08_Items/Gear/Aegis_of_Amberwake.md) fragments and opening [Windbreak Bounty Board](../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) options.
- Cross-Links: Roams [Gravemark Switchbacks](../02_Regions/Gravemark_Switchbacks.md); hunters file sightings on the [Gravemark Warning Board](../09_Artifacts/Gravemark_Warning_Board.md); horns are shipped via the [Old Road Circuit](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md).

## Uses & Myths
- Trophy Use: Cairn-Spiked Horns socket into rail bracers, granting sled control bonuses; tanners also grind horn chips into grip resin.
- Behavior Myth: Porters insist Bullyrams only charge those who skip the bone-token tithe; truth is they charge anything that clangs near a cairn.

## Hunter Voice Snippet
> “If the ropes start humming, don’t pray — pull. Bullyrams hear your teeth chatter and take it as a challenge. Break the horns fast, sell them faster, and leave a bone token or the slidecallers will make you walk the ridge in your socks.”
