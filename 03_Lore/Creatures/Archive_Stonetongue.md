# Archive Stonetongue

- Classification/Nickname: Barnacle-crusted eel dubbed “ledger eels.”
- Use/Trophy/Reagent: Teeth ground into chalk for copying runes in the [Drowned Archive](../../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Saltmarrow_Strand.md#drowned-archive); mucus strands used in [Brine-Tight Sealant](../../08_Items/Professions/Brine-Tight_Sealant.md).
- Behavior Myth: Divers insist stonetongues whisper debts owed; really, their rasping draws fish that hide in pillar shadows.
- Hunter Voice Snippet:
  - “Don’t spook it. Let it think you’re another ledger post, then net it when it stretches.”
  - “Bring extra wax cloth. Their slime eats chalk unless you dry it quick.”
