# FAMILY 9 — SERPENTS

“You don’t hear a serpent coming. You only hear the world go quiet.”

Serpents in Emberwild are not giant fantasy monsters or magical beasts.

They are:

- realistic
- grounded
- biome-accurate
- deadly when mishandled
- woven into the survival tension of grasslands, forests, swamps, and deserts

Their danger comes from:

- stealth
- venom (realistic, not magical)
- constriction
- silent strikes
- environmental camouflage

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Serpents embody:

- stealth
- patience
- territorial ambush
- sudden, decisive strikes
- biome-specific adaptability
- environmental mastery (brush, sand, roots, water)

They fill a ground-level danger role — especially for new players traversing thick grass or marsh.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Habitats

Different species dominate different regions:

- Forest Serpents (brown, green, viper-like)
- Swamp Serpents (wetland constrictors)
- Desert Serpents (sand vipers, sidewinders)
- Coastal Serpents (small constrictors in mangroves)
- Tundra Serpents (rare, short-activity windows)

### Diet

- rodents
- frogs
- birds
- small mammals
- lizards
- carrion (rare)

### Behavior Type

- Ambush Predators
- Territorial Defenders
- Camouflage Specialists
- Silent Strikers

### Season Influence

- Spring: highest activity
- Summer: extremely active in heat
- Autumn: slowing slightly as prey migrates
- Winter: hibernation or low movement (depending on region)

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.2 — TIER VARIANTS

Using Emberwild’s official grounded tier system:

### NORMAL SERPENT

- small to medium size
- one quick strike attack
- moderate venom or mild constriction
- low HP
- found in almost all Outer zones

### RARE SERPENT

- unique scale patterns
- slightly larger
- stronger venom or tighter constriction
- faster lunge speed

### ELITE SERPENT

- large, old serpent
- thick-bodied
- stronger fangs / coil pressure
- aggressive zone defense
- multiple strike chain
- Inner/Heartlands only

### RARE ELITE SERPENT

- enormous regional serpent
- noticeable scale ridges
- extremely dangerous strike speed
- extended coil behavior
- signature drop: Barbed Fang, Elder Scale Ridge

### MINI-BOSS SERPENT

NOT tamable.

- massive constrictor or giant viper (realistic size, not fantasy)
- handcrafted AI
- burrow → strike pattern
- long coil-crush sequence
- “ground ripple” warning in sand/dirt

### BOSS SERPENT

Dungeon-only:

- ancient serpent in caves, roots, or ruins
- multi-phase
- environmental hazards (falling rocks, root wraps)

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Serpents are the hardest family to track because they leave minimal footprint.

### Tracks

- faint sliding lines
- body drags
- intermittent tail trails
- almost invisible in dense grass

### Shedded Scales

- small scale flakes
- Rare/Elite = larger, patterned scales

### Burrow Holes

- round, body-sized holes
- fresh dirt around edges
- used heavily in deserts and forests

### Kill Signs

- small prey crushed
- fang marks
- disturbed soil

### Environmental Clues

- sudden silence in brush
- birds fleeing low ground
- movement under dead leaves

Serpents rely on silence, not tracks.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.4 — AI BEHAVIOR & COMBAT LOGIC

Serpents specialize in:

- stealth
- sudden aggression
- precision hit-and-retreat

### Primary Behaviors

- strike → retreat
- coil → crush
- flicker-feint to confuse
- burrow → ambush emerge
- stealth movement through foliage

### Strike Logic

Triggered by:

- close proximity
- sudden movement
- stepping near the serpent’s hiding spot

### Venom (Realistic)

Venom causes:

- gradual stamina drain
- slight health decay
- slowed dodge/response
- mild blur (if applicable to class vision)

NO magical poison.

### Flee Logic

- Normal: 40% HP
- Rare: 30%
- Elite: 20%
- Rare Elite: 10%
- Mini-Boss: never

### Environmental Mastery

Serpents excel at:

- grasslands
- swamp reeds
- sand dunes
- root networks

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.5 — WEATHER INTERACTION

### Rain

- slows many species
- reduces strike accuracy

### Fog

- serpents remain hidden longer
- most dangerous conditions

### Heatwave

- desert serpents peak activity
- most aggressive timing

### Snow

- nearly all cold-blooded species slow dramatically
- easy tracking, reduced danger

### Storms

- serpents stay in burrows
- low chance to encounter

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage

- moderate bite damage
- bleed risk (rare)
- realistic venom effect
- strong constriction (Elite+)

### Defenses

- low HP
- high stealth
- small hitbox
- strong initial strike avoidance

### Weaknesses

- vulnerable after missing a strike
- poor vs fire
- terrible against aerial predators
- cannot handle multiple opponents

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.7 — LOOT TABLE

### Normal Serpent

- Serpent Meat
- Small Scales
- Fang (basic crafting)

### Rare Serpent

- Patterned Scales
- Sharp Fang
- Venom Gland (realistic, small dose)

### Elite Serpent

- Elder Scales
- Large Fang
- Coiling Bone (crafting handle core)

### Rare Elite Serpent

- Barbed Fang
- Elder Scale Ridge
- Potent Venom Gland (rare alchemy reagent)
- Dense Ribbone

### Mini-Boss Serpent

- Trophy Fang
- Giant Scaleplate
- Exceptional crafting core

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.8 — TAMER COMPANION SUMMARY

Serpents CAN be companions — only:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite

Rare Elite + Mini-Boss cannot be tamed.

### Companion Role: STEALTH / CONTROL / DEBUFF

### Strengths

- amazing stealth
- good single-target control
- venom debuff (realistic)
- silent tracking
- small profile

### Weaknesses

- extremely fragile
- low morale
- high care complexity
- poor vs groups

### Companion Behaviors

- Strike
- Coil
- Burrow Guard
- Debilitating Bite
- Latch (Elite only)

Serpents are high-skill companions for ambush or stealthy players.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9.9 — FAMILY ROLE IN WORLD DESIGN

Serpents reinforce:

- ground-level tension
- biome identity
- slow, careful exploration
- realistic danger in grasslands/swamps
- alchemical reagent loops
- stealth ecosystem balance

They add the “fear of the unknown in tall brush” to Emberwild.
