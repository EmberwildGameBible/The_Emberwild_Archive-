# FAMILY 10 — STAGS & HORNED BEASTS

“Grace until threatened. Then the forest lowers its head and charges.”

This family contains all large herbivores with antlers or horns:

- stags
- elk
- moose
- highland horned beasts
- tundra elk
- swamp antlered bulls
- plains longhorns
- ridgehorn goats
- desert hornrams

All realistic, grounded, ecological.

They are not predators — but they can be lethal.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Stags and horned beasts represent:

- territorial defense
- herd dynamics
- sudden, explosive aggression
- speed + mass
- strong social structure
- dangerous rut-season behavior

They fill the role of large, semi-dangerous herbivores that act unpredictably:

- normally peaceful
- extremely dangerous when startled, cornered, or in rut season

They are a huge part of Emberwild’s tracking and hunting loop.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Habitats

Different sub-species inhabit:

- dense forests (stags, deer)
- snow regions (tundra elk)
- swamp edges (swamp elk, antler bulls)
- plains (wild elk, longhorns)
- hills/highlands (ridgehorn goats)
- deserts (hardhorn rams)

### Diet

- grasses
- bark
- roots
- shrubs
- berries
- aquatic plants (marsh elk / swamp bulls)

### Behavior Type

- flight-first prey
- herd protectors
- territorial males
- charge attackers when threatened

### Season Influence

- Spring: herd migration
- Summer: strong grazing patterns
- Autumn (rut season): most dangerous
- Winter: movement slows, herd huddling

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.2 — TIER VARIANTS

Using Emberwild’s grounded tier system:

### NORMAL STAG / HORNED BEAST

- fast runners
- territorial males
- herd behavior
- moderate HP
- lethal short-range charge

### RARE STAG

- unique antler configuration
- larger frame
- stronger morale
- faster fleeing speed
- found in Outer+Inner zones

### ELITE STAG / HORNED BEAST

- enormous mature male
- deeply scarred
- extremely aggressive during rut
- heavy charge → can break bones
- strong herd influence

### RARE ELITE STAG

- massive, legendary-sized within natural limits
- towering antlers, distinctive markings
- very dangerous charge
- signature drops:
    - Thick Antlers
    - Great Horn Ridge

### MINI-BOSS HORNED BEAST

NOT tamable.

- ancient lone bull or ridgehorn patriarch
- handcrafted fight
- double charge pattern
- stomp + throw combo
- territorial roar
- found in deep Inner or Heartlands

### BOSS

Dungeon-only (deep caverns, forest temples, ridge shrines).

Environmental hazards: fallen logs, tight spaces.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Stags & horned beasts leave some of the most recognizable trail signs.

### Tracks

- split hooves
- deep prints for elk/moose
- Rare/Elite prints are wider + deeper
- long stride length

### Tree Rubbing

- antler scraping against bark
- height indicates size tier
- Elite + Rare Elite leave heavy bark removal

### Droppings

- pellet clusters
- frequency indicates herd size

### Mud Prints / River Crossings

- water drips
- hoof-churned mud
- displaced reeds

### Ground Disturbance

- grazing signs
- trampled grass
- broken underbrush
- rut-dug pits
    
    (males dig shallow pits during rut season)
    

### Sound Clues

- distant snorts
- hoof thuds
- branch cracking

This family is largely about herd tracking.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.4 — AI BEHAVIOR & COMBAT LOGIC

Priority behavior:

Flee first. Fight only when cornered or during rut season.

### Primary Behaviors

- sudden sprint flee
- wide-arc turns
- charge attack
- stomp + head push
- herd grouping when threatened

### Charge Logic

Triggered by:

- player stands between male + herd
- startling approach
- aggressive posture
- attacking calves

### Rut Season Behavior

One of the most dangerous seasonal features:

- males become territorial
- may charge unprovoked
- frequent antler clashes between males
- higher aggression radius

### Flee Logic

- Normal: 70% flee-first
- Rare: 60% flee
- Elite: 50% flee
- Rare Elite: 30% flee
- Mini-Boss: almost never flees

### Environmental Mastery

They excel in:

- open plains
- forest paths
- shallow water
- highland slopes

But struggle in:

- dense swamp muck
- deep snow

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.5 — WEATHER INTERACTION

### Rain

- herds cluster
- males more defensive

### Fog

- herds get jumpy
- easy to spook into chain reactions

### Snow

- movement slows
- easier to track

### Storms

- herds retreat into deep woods
- bulls more likely to charge if trapped

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage

- very high charge damage
- medium stomp damage
- heavy knockdown potential

### Defenses

- moderate HP
- thick hide (elk/moose)
- good resistance to piercing (antlered species)

### Weaknesses

- predictable charge telegraph
- poor turning when sprinting
- easily routed by fire
- weak when stuck in tight terrain

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10.7 — LOOT TABLE

### Normal

- Meat
- Hide
- Basic Antlers / Horns

### Rare

- Patterned Antlers
- Thick Hide
- Heavy Bone

### Elite

- Elder Antlers
- Dense Hide
- Ridgebone

### Rare Elite

- Thick Antlers
- Great Horn Ridge
- Elk Heart
- Thick Hide

### Mini-Boss

- Trophy Antlers
- Massive Ridgehorn Plate
- Unique regional crafting token

══════════════════════════

# SECTION 30.10.8 — TAMER COMPANION SUMMARY

Stags / Horned beasts CAN be companions, but ONLY:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite

Rare Elite & Mini-Boss cannot be tamed.

### Companion Role: CHARGER / TANKY RUNNER

### Strengths

- fastest burst sprint of all companions
- strong knockdown charge
- dependable morale
- good front-line presence
- great pathfinding in plains

### Weaknesses

- poor in tight terrain
- struggles against predators
- low obedience during rut season
- slow turning radius

### Companion Behaviors

- Charge
- Stomp
- Herd Guard
- Ram
- Territorial Warning (elite only)

══════════════════════════

# SECTION 30.10.9 — FAMILY ROLE IN WORLD DESIGN

Stags & horned beasts give Emberwild:

- herd dynamics
- grazing migrations
- early hunting identity
- food & hide economy
- tracking practice
- seasonal danger (rut)
- emergent events (stampedes, herd scatter)

They are the backbone of the prey ecosystem.
