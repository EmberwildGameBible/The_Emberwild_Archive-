Bears are not magical.

Their threat is entirely natural:

They are one of the most dangerous overworld species.

# SECTION 30.2.4 — AI BEHAVIOR PATTERNS

Bears are the heaviest, slowest-moving predators with the highest single-hit threat.

### Aggro Logic

- territorial triggers

- protection of cubs (extreme danger)
- highly predictable warning pattern:

    2. stomp
    3. stand
    4. charge

### Primary Behaviors

- Charge → heavy bite
- Swipe → knockback
- Rear → drop-slam
- Defensive turn (back protection)

### Flee Logic

Bears rarely flee:

- Normal: below ~40% health
- Rare: below ~30%
- Elite: below ~20%
- Rare Elite: below ~15%
- Mini-Boss: almost never

### Environmental Interaction

- can break small obstacles
- can push fallen logs
- can knock over players

### Weather Influence

- rain: roam wider
- fog: more territorial

# SECTION 30.2.8 — FAMILY ROLE IN WORLD DESIGN

Bears define:
