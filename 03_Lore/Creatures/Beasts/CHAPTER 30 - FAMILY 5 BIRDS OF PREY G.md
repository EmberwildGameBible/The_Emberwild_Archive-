# FAMILY 5 — BIRDS OF PREY

“A shadow on the wind is sometimes the only warning you get.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Birds of prey represent:

- tactical vision
- aerial precision
- heightened awareness
- dive-strike lethality
- silent hovering
- scouting and tracking synergy

They form the aerial predator class of Emberwild —

not magical, not fantasy, simply realistic, dangerous raptors.

They fill ecosystem roles such as:

- rodent control
- scavenging
- aerial strikes
- cliff-peak dominance
- long-range observation

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Primary Habitats

- high cliffs
- mountainous ledges
- dense forests (owls)
- plains and prairie skies
- coastal ridges
- swamp canopy (lightweight kites)

### Diet

- small mammals
- fish
- snakes
- carrion (vultures, kites)
- small predators

### Behavior Type

- Aerial Hunters
- Dive Attack Specialists
- Territorial Watchers
- Scavenger Opportunists

### Season Influence

- Autumn: migration patterns
- Winter: scarcity → increased aggression
- Spring: nest protection → extremely territorial
- Summer: wide-range hunting

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.2 — TIER VARIANTS

- ground rush claw combo
- extremely fast aerial repositioning

### BOSS BIRD

Dungeon-only, usually in:

- tower ruins
- cliffside arenas
- abandoned spires

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Birds leave indirect clues — tracking focuses on environment and droppings.

### Droppings (Whitewash)

- concentrated beneath perches
- varies by species
- Rare/Elite leave clean, chalky lines

### Feathers

- distinct flightfeathers
- Rare variants have unique stripes or coloration

### Kill Sites

- small prey carcasses
- puncture marks
- feathers arranged in feeding circles

### Nest Clues

- cliff ledges with sticks
- scrap piles
- discarded bones
- whitewash streaks

### Auditory Signs

- screeches
- territorial cries
- wing-buffet rush sounds

This family is about listening and observing, not following tracks on dirt.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.4 — AI BEHAVIOR PATTERNS

Birds of prey are aerial tacticians, not melee brawlers.

### Primary Behaviors

- dive claws
- swoop attacks
- wing-buffet (knockback)
- aerial reposition
- retreat to height

### Dive Logic

Triggered by:

- player exposed in open
- companion straying too far
- surprised prey
- low ambient noise (optimal condition)

Dive =

heavy damage + stagger + bleed (Elite+ tiers).

### Ground Logic

Birds avoid staying grounded unless:

- wounded
- elite variants protecting their nest
- mid-fight transitions

### Flee Logic

- Normal: 40%
- Rare: 30%
- Elite: 20%
- Rare Elite: 10%
- Mini-Boss: almost never

### Threat Logic

Birds scan wide areas before engaging.

They do NOT attack blindly.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.5 — WEATHER INTERACTION

### Clear Skies

- highest dive accuracy
- far tracking range

### Rain

- grounded quickly
- dive accuracy reduced
- nests become priority territory

### Fog

- birds retreat to higher perches
- extremely rare dives

### Snow

- ground-level hunting
- easier to track via droppings/kill sites

### Storms

- birds cluster
- avoid flying entirely
- use cliffs for cover

Grounded world. No magical weather synergy.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage

- high burst from dive
- medium bleed
- wing-buffet stun
- talon rake (airborne or ground)

### Defenses

- low HP
- low armor
- high evasion (in air)

### Weaknesses

- extremely vulnerable when grounded
- dislikes fire
- poor performance in dense forests (except owls)

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.7 — LOOT TABLE

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.8 — TAMER COMPANION SUMMARY

Birds of prey CAN be companions — but only:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite

Rare Elite and Mini-Boss cannot be tamed.

### Companion Role: TRACKING / HARASS / HIGH-MOBILITY ASSIST

### Strengths

- best long-range detection
- best tracking assistance
- aerial scouting
- safe harassment attacks
- excellent bleed initiation

### Weaknesses

- low durability
- weak against heavy melee
- requires careful positioning
- distracting AI if untrained

### Companion Behaviors

- Swoop
- Harass
- Track Overwatch
- Aerial Guard
- Dive Peck (Elite only)

Birds provide vision, not raw DPS — a perfect Tamer companion type.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5.9 — FAMILY ROLE IN WORLD DESIGN

Birds of prey shape:

- cliff and ridge identities
- awareness challenges
- long-distance creature detection
- vertical world design
- survival tension in open plains
- story moments involving nests, trails, and migration

They complement wolves, cats, boars, and bears by filling the aerial predator niche.
