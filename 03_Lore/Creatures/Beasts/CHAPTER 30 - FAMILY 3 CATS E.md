# FAMILY 3 — GREAT CATS

“A great cat doesn’t fight you. It ends you before you know it was there.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Great Cats represent:

- perfect ambush predators
- stealth mastery
- lightning-fast bursts
- solitary territorial hunters
- precision lethality
- the “ghost predators” of Emberwild

They are the most dangerous 1v1 predators in the overworld.

Not because they are big —

but because they are invisible until too late.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Habitat

- thick forests (Forest Lions, Shadowcats)
- high mountains (Highland Cats)
- plains edges (Cougars)
- tundra foothills (Snow Lynx variants)

### Diet

- deer
- goats
- small predators
- scavenging
- occasionally livestock

### Behavior Type

- Ambush Predators
- Territorial Solitaries
- Night-Stalkers
- Stealth Sprinters

Great Cats rarely hunt in groups except:

- mothers with cubs
- rare seasonal migrations

### Season Influence

- Winter: easier to track (prints clear), far more aggressive
- Spring: cub season → dens extremely high danger
- Summer: cats hunt long hours at night
- Autumn: cats bulk up, roam further

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.2 — TIER VARIANTS

Using Emberwild’s grounded tier system:

### NORMAL GREAT CAT

- lean, fast, silent
- burst damage
- low health compared to bears
- lives in Outer/Inner zones
- extremely hard to see before attack

### RARE GREAT CAT

- unique coloration (pale, amber, shadow)
- higher stealth
- longer detection radius
- better stamina
- tracks slightly deeper

### ELITE GREAT CAT

- older, heavier, scarred
- improved burst window
- multi-hit rake combo
- extended stealth time
- higher morale
- fights aggressively instead of retreating

### RARE ELITE GREAT CAT

- exceptionally large and cunning
- extremely refined ambush timing
- silent landing and near-invisible stalk
- signature drop: Exceptional Feline Pelt, Razorclaw Core
- only found in deep Inner and Heartlands

### MINI-BOSS CAT

- NOT tamable
- massive rogue cat, “King Stalker” class
- handcrafted AI
- long-range pounce
- double-stagger rake
- silence aura (purely sound dampening, not magic)
- found in dens or cliff overlooks in Heartlands

### BOSS CAT

Dungeon-only:

- found in cliffside caves, ruins, or old shrines
- cinematic pounce points
- multiple phase behavior
- tight-space stealth hunts

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Great Cats leave subtle but telling signs.

### Footprints

- light, soft impressions
- almost no heel weight
- hard to see in dry ground
- Rare/Elite: deeper forepaw marks (muscle weight)

### Scratches

- tree scratches at head height
- territory signals
- claw slices on rotten logs
- faint scrapes on rocks

### Scat

- small
- mixed hair and bone
- usually near trails or scent posts

### Stalk Indicators

- disturbed leaf litter
- displaced soil
- short drag marks
- a “quiet zone” where ambient wildlife goes silent

### Kill Sites

- throats torn cleanly
- hidden carcasses partially covered
- bones stripped with precision

Great Cats are the hardest family to track in Emberwild.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.4 — BEHAVIOR & AI

Great Cats specialize in hit-and-vanish, ambush, and precision aggression.

### Primary Behaviors

- stealth stalk
- low-profile crawl
- patience waiting
- sudden ambush
- retreat into brush
- re-engage from a new angle

### Pounce Logic

Triggered when:

- player turns back
- visibility is low
- weather obscures sound
- player is sprinting (noise)
- companion wanders ahead

Pounce =

high stagger + heavy bleed + knockdown chance (depending on tier).

### Flee Logic

- Normal: 40%
- Rare: 30%
- Elite: 20%
- Rare Elite: 10%
- Mini-Boss: nearly never

### Environmental Use

- ledges
- brush
- fallen logs
- cliffs
- dens

They fight like true predators — calculated, not chaotic.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.5 — WEATHER INTERACTIONS

Great Cats become terrifying under certain weather:

### Fog

- strongest advantage
- silent approach
- low visibility
- high ambush chance

### Rain

- quieter movement
- easier to stalk prey
- scent masking helps cats ambush players

### Snow

- visible tracks
- cats become hungrier
- higher aggression

### Storms

- cats retreat from thunder
- but roam wider in heavy rain

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage:

- highest single-target burst of any overworld predator
- heavy bleed
- pounce knockdown
- rake combos (elite+)

### Defenses:

- low HP compared to bears
- medium stagger resistance
- relies on stealth, not durability

### Weaknesses:

- predictable telegraph (low crouch before pounce)
- easily scared by fire/torches
- vulnerable if you block the first strike

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.7 — LOOT TABLE

### Normal Great Cat

- Lean Meat
- Cat Pelt
- Small Claws

### Rare Great Cat

- Sharp Claw

- Feline Tendon (crafting)

### Rare Elite Great Cat

- Exceptional Feline Pelt (high-end leather)
- Razorclaw Core
- Tough Tendon
- Spiritbloom-touched whisker (rare alchemy stabilizer — grounded, not magical)

### Mini-Boss Cat

- Ridgeback Spine Plate
- Exceptional Pelt

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.8 — TAMER COMPANION SUMMARY

Great Cats CAN be companions — but only:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite

Rare Elite and Mini-Boss are NOT tamable.

### Companion Role: BURST / AMBUSH / CONTROL

### Strengths

- highest DPS among all companion types
- incredible ambush capability
- fast target switching
- bleed power
- great chase mobility

### Weaknesses

- lowest morale
- flees under pressure
- harder to bond
- fragile vs bears/boars
- needs frequent feeding

### Companion Behaviors

- Pounce
- Ambush
- Stealth Crawl
- Bleed Swipe
- Guard Stalk (watch the perimeter silently)

Cats are the most skill-intensive companion type.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3.9 — FAMILY ROLE IN THE WORLD

Great Cats define:

- stealth danger
- night visibility threat
- Inner → Heartlands predation
- high-skill tracking
- burst-based enemy design
- tension in quiet zones
- seasonal migration stories

They form a “triangle of fear” with Wolves and Bears, completing the predator ecosystem.
