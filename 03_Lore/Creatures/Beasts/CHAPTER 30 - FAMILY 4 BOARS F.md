# FAMILY 4 — BOARS

“A boar charges with the weight of the land itself behind it.”

Boars are not exotic.

They are not majestic.

They are not supernatural.

But they are one of the most violent, unpredictable, and territorial species in Emberwild — and a critical part of the ecosystem.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Boars represent:

- raw aggression
- short-range brutality
- territorial fury
- unpredictable charges
- stubborn resilience
- powerful survival instincts

Boars are the world’s quintessential “danger in the brush” animal.

They are responsible for more new-player deaths than any other early creature.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Habitat

- forests
- plains
- highland valleys
- foothills
- river edges

Avoid:

- tundra (too cold for most boar species)
- deserts

### Diet

- roots
- nuts
- berries
- carrion
- fungi
- small animals (rare opportunistic behavior)

### Behavior Type

- Territorial Bruisers
- Unpredictable Chargers
- Semi-Herd Animals
- Aggressive Defenders of Young

### Season Influence

- Spring: extremely protective mothers
- Summer: aggressive food-competition fights
- Autumn: boars grow heavier (fattening season)
- Winter: reduced movement but increased desperation

Using your official tier structure:

### NORMAL BOAR

- aggressive
- moderate HP
- dangerous charge
- fast short-range acceleration
- early-mid game threat

### RARE BOAR

- larger body
- unique tusk curve or pattern
- stronger charge windup
- improved hide thickness
- found in Outer & Inner zones

### ELITE BOAR

- massive adult male
- extremely territorial
- heavily scarred
- devastating charge (knockdown + stagger)
- high stamina pool
- prefers to “double charge” when wounded
- almost always found in Inner + Heartlands

### RARE ELITE BOAR

- Heartlands only

### MINI-BOSS BOAR

- “Juggernaut Boar”
- NOT tamable
- enormous tank of a beast
- handcrafted fight behavior

- gore → toss attack
- rage threshold (second wind behavior)
- dens near cliffs, thickets, or ravines

### BOSS BOAR

Dungeon-only, often called:

- “Rootbreaker”
- “Deep-Tusk Lord”
- “Old Rootboar”

Environmental hazards:

narrow corridors, roots, fallen logs.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Boars leave some of the most distinctive clues in the world.

### Footprints

- deep, split hoof prints
- Elite: heavier, wider stance
- Rare Elite: very deep prints, soil overturned

### Ground Disturbance

- rooting marks (soil churned)
- broken mushrooms
- overturned logs
- dug-up patches

### Scat

- scattered, pellet-like
- contains roots/berries
- heavy concentration near dens

### Tusk Marks

- scraped bark
- gouges on trees
- horizontal scraping on fallen logs

### Sounds

- snorts
- pig-like grunts
- sudden rustling before a charge

Boars are notoriously hard to track right before an ambush — they stay quiet until charging.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4.4 — AI BEHAVIOR PATTERNS

Boars are the most aggressive open-world initiators.

### Primary Behaviors

- sudden charge after short telegraph
- tusk gore
- flank-push (bodily shove)
- frantic retreat when deeply wounded
- “fury stance” (Elite+ tiers only)

### Charge Logic

Triggered by:

- proximity
- loud noise
- threatening posture
- scent disturbance

Boars often charge:

- twice
- or even three times in a row (Elite+)

### Flee Logic

- Normal: flee ~40%
- Rare: flee ~30%
- Elite: flee ~20%
- Rare Elite: flee ~10%
- Mini-Boss: very rarely

### Territorial Zones

Extremely strict:

- food patches
- mud pits
- dens
- narrow passes

Entering any of these triggers instant aggression.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4.5 — WEATHER INTERACTION

### Rain

- boars become more active
- softer soil increases rooting
- mud improves boar traction

### Fog

- boars become almost invisible until they charge
- extremely dangerous

### Snow

- slowed movement
- deeper charge prints
- moderate aggression

### Storms

- boars avoid open terrain
- often cluster in brush

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage

- heavy blunt damage
- gore bleed
- multi-hit tusk combos (Elite+)
- knockdown charge

### Defenses

- thick hide
- high HP
- strong stagger resistance
- excellent traction in mud

### Weaknesses

- terrible turning radius mid-charge
- predictable telegraph
- vulnerable when exhausted
- poorly suited for tight turns

Boars are easy to avoid if you know terrain

— and lethal if you don’t.

Boars define:

- leather supply chain

They are the early chapters of “learn to respect nature” in Emberwild.
