# CHAPTER 30 — FAMILY 11: CANINES

Emberwild Game Bible v4.1 — FINAL VERSION

────────────────────────

# FAMILY 11 — CANINES

“Clever, cautious, persistent — the shadows between predators and prey.”

Canines are the middle-ground carnivores of Emberwild:

- not as strong as wolves
- not as stealthy as cats
- not as fast as raptors
- but far smarter than expected
- and more adaptable than any other predator family

They fill roles like:

- scavenging
- opportunistic hunting
- nighttime stalking
- ecosystem balancing
- spreading danger across mid-tier zones

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.11.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Canines represent:

- cunning
- adaptability
- opportunism
- survival through intelligence, not brute force

They excel at:

- tracking
- stealing kills
- scavenging
- harassing prey
- pack harassment behavior
- vocal coordination

They are not noble like wolves or silent like cats —

they are smart survivors, thriving where others struggle.

### Habitats

Different species dominate different regions:

- Forest Foxes
- Plains Coyotes
- Swamp Jackals
- Highland Dholes
- Desert Wild Dogs
- Tundra Foxes

### Diet

Highly flexible:

- small mammals
- insects
- berries
- carrion
- fish (coastal variants)
- scraps and leftovers from larger predators

### Behavior Type

- opportunistic hunters
- scavengers
- harassment pack hunters
- stealth foragers

### Season Influence

- Winter: foxes thrive (best hunters)

- Rare: 40%
- Elite: 30%
- Rare Elite: 20%
- Mini-Boss: almost never

### Environmental Strengths

They excel at:

- grasslands

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.11.5 — WEATHER INTERACTION

### Fog

- canines become more curious
- increased harassment behavior

### Rain

- track scents weaken
- canines scavenge aggressively

### Snow

### Storms

- less roaming

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.11.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

- fast attack frequency

### Defenses
