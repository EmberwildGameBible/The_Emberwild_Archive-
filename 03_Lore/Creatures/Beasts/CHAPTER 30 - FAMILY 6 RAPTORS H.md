# FAMILY 6 — RAPTORS (GROUND PREDATORS)

“Fast. Precise. Territorial. When the brush quiets, they are circling you already.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Raptors fill the ecological niche between wolves (pack discipline) and great cats (ambush precision):

- lightning-fast sprinters
- low-profile stalkers
- coordinated group-hunters
- silent directional communicators
- deadly clawed bursts
- strategic flanking

They are not dinosaurs.

They are realistic, naturalistic ground predators—think:

- cassowary agility
- feathered proto-bird structure
- predatory intent
- anatomical realism

Their strength comes from speed and tactics, not size.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Habitats

- warm forests
- tallgrass plains
- rocky foothills
- desert fringes (thin-feathered species)
- high ridges

### Diet

- small mammals
- fawns
- carrion
- injured prey
- opportunistic pack kills

### Behavior Type

- coordinated pack hunters
- precision flankers
- directional chirp-communicators
- terrain-sensitive sprinters

### Seasonal Influence

- Spring: nesting → extremely territorial
- Summer: long-range hunting bursts
- Autumn: pack migrations, best sightings
- Winter: fewer jumps, more stalking

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.2 — TIER VARIANTS

Following Emberwild’s grounded 6-tier system:

### NORMAL RAPTOR

- 2–3 pack size
- fast lateral movement
- moderate damage
- low HP, high agility

### RARE RAPTOR

- distinctive feather patterns
- faster leap wind-up
- more coordinated pack timing
- deeper claw prints

### ELITE RAPTOR

- pack leader
- heavy chest, thicker claws
- directional call commands
- extended leap range
- stronger morale

### RARE ELITE RAPTOR

- dominant regional alpha
- low footstep noise
- curved talons
- terrifying ambush timing
- signature drop: Jagged Talon, Alpha Spine Ridge
- Inner + Heartlands only

### MINI-BOSS RAPTOR

NOT tamable.

- colossal rogue male or matriarch
- handcrafted multi-stage AI
- double-leap chain
- “pin + shred” behavior
- most dangerous mid-game predator

### BOSS RAPTOR

Dungeon-only.

Often in:

- collapsed stone halls
- forest ruins
- ridge caverns

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Raptors leave distinctive, narrow, claw-tracked evidence:

### Footprints

- three-toed claw strikes
- forward-weighted posture
- sudden direction changes visible
- Rare/Elite have deeper foreclaw impacts

### Ground Disturbances

- scratch marks in bark
- disturbed grass trails
- claw-scrapes on stones
- compressed soil from leaps

### Feathers

- small, camouflaged, stiff feathers
- Rare variants have faint striping

### Kill Sites

- shredded fur patterns
- talon-cut wounds
- half-eaten carcasses hidden under brush

### Sound

- clicking or chirping between pack members
- soft brush rustling
- rapid pattering before leaps

Raptor trails expire quickly — speed predators don’t linger.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.4 — AI BEHAVIOR & COMBAT LOGIC

Raptors combine the coordination of wolves with the precision of great cats.

### Primary Combat Behaviors

- leap → rake combo
- flank-and-burst
- group feints
- chase resets
- tag-team attacks

### Elite Leadership Behavior

- directional chirp commands:
    
    flank left, flank right, charge, retreat
    
- pack instantly reacts

### Ambush Logic

Triggered when:

- player distracted
- companion pulls aggro
- weather reduces visibility
- tight terrain funnels prey

### Flee Logic

- Normal: ~40% HP
- Rare: ~30%
- Elite: ~20%
- Rare Elite: ~10%
- Mini-Boss: almost never

### Environmental Mastery

Raptors excel at:

- weaving through trees
- using brush to break line of sight
- climbing short ledges
- cornering prey in tight terrain

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.5 — WEATHER INTERACTIONS

### Fog

- raptors become deadly
- perfect for ambushes

### Rain

- slower leap accuracy
- quieter approach
- improved traction on wet soil

### Snow

- greatly reduced speed
- but tracks are easier to follow

### Storm

- packs stay nearer to cover
- occasional aggression bursts due to noise

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage

- rapid slash/rake
- bleed from claws
- fast re-engagement

### Defenses

- low HP
- high side-dodge
- strong opening burst armor (brief)

### Weaknesses

- crumble under sustained melee
- staggerable during leap wind-up
- firelight disrupts coordination

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.7 — LOOT TABLE

### Normal Raptor

- Lean Meat
- Raptor Hide
- Small Talons

### Rare Raptor

- Patterned Hide
- Razor Talon
- Sinew Filaments

### Elite Raptor

- Heavy Raptor Hide
- Alpha Talon
- Spine Ridge (crafting material)

### Rare Elite Raptor

- Jagged Talon
- Alpha Spine Ridge
- High-tension Sinew
- Feathered Crest (rare alchemy stabilizer)

### Mini-Boss Raptor

- Trophy Skull
- Ridgeback Boneplate
- Exceptional Hide

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.8 — TAMER COMPANION SUMMARY

Raptors CAN be companions — but only:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite

Rare Elite and Mini-Boss CANNOT be tamed.

### Companion Role: PURSUIT / DPS / BLEED SPECIALIST

### Strengths

- fastest ground companion
- best bleed-over-time
- incredible mobility
- excels at hunting fleeing prey

### Weaknesses

- low durability
- demands constant feeding
- poor performance in cold climates
- requires skill to control effectively

### Companion Behaviors

- Leap
- Rake
- Flank Sprint
- Chase
- Pack Rally (Tamer talent-enhanced)

Raptors are the highest DPS mobility companions in the game.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6.9 — FAMILY ROLE IN WORLD DESIGN

Raptors:

- define chase combat
- control Inner zone pacing
- create “brush danger” moments
- pressure careless travelers
- fill the gap between wolves and cats
- support regional identity (plains, forests, ridges)

They are essential for Emberwild’s fast-threat ecosystem.
