# Thornlash Prowler

## Field Summary
- Local Classification: "wall wolves" to Strand guards; scholars tag them as ash drift-touched coyotes with pale pitch in their coats.
- Origin: Packs nested under the palisade when ash drifts drove them off the flats; they learned to follow sled grease trails for warmth.
- Cultural Tie: Marrowhook sentries hang pierced teeth from their belts as contraband markers, while Slidecaller hunters trade hides for sled grip resin.
- Gameplay Hook: Mid-20s elites that spawn during [Thornlash Palisade Duties](../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md) sweeps; drop **Pitch-Matted Pelts** used to boost [Thornlash Sentry Wristwraps](../../08_Items/Gear/Thornlash_Sentry_Wristwraps.md) and bounty flags on the [Windbreak Bounty Board](../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md).
- Cross-Links: Stalks [Thornlash Palisade](../02_Regions/Thornlash_Palisade.md) trenches, recorded on the [Thornlash Warning Slate](../09_Artifacts/Thornlash_Warning_Slate.md), and lured by salt bricks tied to the [Sentry Ration Docket](../09_Artifacts/Sentry_Ration_Docket.md).

## Uses & Myths
- Trophy Use: Pitch-Matted Pelts are boiled into resin that keeps sled brakes from freezing; teeth are bartered as unofficial brine scrip.
- Behavior Myth: Dice players swear the prowlers only howl when smugglers sneak through; in truth they howl whenever lantern soot blows their way.

## Hunter Voice Snippet
> "They watch the wall more than we do. If you see the sandbags twitch, step aside and let the prowler hit the plank — the salt bricks will spill and it’ll chase those instead. Leave a tooth at the tally post or the Slidecallers will make you patch the gap yourself."
