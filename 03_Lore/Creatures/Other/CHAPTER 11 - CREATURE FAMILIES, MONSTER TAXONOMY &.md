# 11.3 — What No Longer Exists

These categories are officially removed from the Emberwild canon:

### ❌ Spirit Creatures

### ❌ Magical Beasts

### ❌ Evolved Fantasy Animals

### ❌ “Legendary” supernatural animals

### ❌ Any animal with supernatural abilities

### ❌ Any old temporary family names

### ❌ Any dinosaur-sized raptors or fantasy reptiles

### ❌ Any non-grounded “animal talent trees”

### ❌ Elemental wolves, cats, birds, etc.

These were part of versions v0–v3, all fully deprecated.

---

# 11.4 — Companion Eligibility

Only the following tiers are tamable:

### ✔

### Elite

The following cannot be tamed:

This replaces older companion loopholes or exceptions.

---

# 11.5 — Behavioral Archetypes

Every creature falls into one or more behavior classes:

### Ambush Predator

(cats, lizards, serpents)

### Pack Hunter

(wolves, ground raptors, dholes)

### Harasser / Opportunist

(canines)

### Territorial Heavy

(bears, boars, turtles)

### Flee-First Herbivore

(stags, elk)

### Dive Predator

(birds of prey)

These are used in AI logic under Appendix F.

---

# 11.6 — Seasonal Behavior Framework

Correcting older drafts:

### Spring

### — Mating, territorial protection

### Summer

### — Peak mobility, extended hunting

### Autumn

### — Migration, rut season (horned beasts), increased predator activity

### Winter

### — Hibernation / low activity (bears, turtles, serpents)

This replaces older, inconsistent seasonal notes.
