# FAMILY 8 — CRABS

“Quiet until they aren’t. Then all you hear are claws.”

Crabs in Emberwild are not cartoonish or fantasy-sized.

They are realistic, but some species are large enough to be legitimate threats.

This family covers:

- shore crabs
- marsh crabs
- cliffside rock crabs
- deep coastal armored crabs
- wetland burrowers
- tidal hunters

All grounded. All ecological.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.0 — FAMILY IDENTITY

Crabs represent:

- ambush behavior
- shell-based defense
- sudden snapping attacks
- territorial aggression
- environmental mastery (sand, rock, mud)
- swarm patterns in shoreline areas

They fill the coastal and wetland “hazard predator” role.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.1 — BIOLOGY & ECOLOGY

### Habitats

- rocky coasts
- beaches
- tidal zones
- wetlands
- mangroves
- marshes

### Diet

- fish
- dead animals (scavenger behavior)
- insects
- seaweed
- small crabs
- anything that wanders too close

### Behavior Type

- Ambush predators
- Scavengers
- Swarm defenders
- Shell-armored chargers

### Season Influence

- Spring: mating → high activity
- Summer: aggressive feeding
- Autumn: shell-hardening season
- Winter: reduced movement

Crabs rarely wander far inland unless pulled by floods or storms.

# SECTION 30.8.2 — TIER VARIANTS

### NORMAL CRAB

- moderate size
- fast sideways movement
- sharp claws
- decent armor from shell
- swarms in groups of 2–4 in wetlands

### RARE CRAB

- unique coloration (iron-blue, rust-red, bone-white)
- thicker shell
- stronger grip
- slightly larger

### ELITE CRAB

- big-bodied armored crab
- near-impenetrable shell front
- powerful pincer snap (high stagger)
- capable of short charge-bursts

### RARE ELITE CRAB

- massive regional Rare or Elite crab
- deeply ridged shell
- heavy claw pressure (bone-crack potential)
- terrifying burst from stillness
- signature drops: Elder Pincer, Tough Shell Segment
- found in Heartland or deep coastal ledges

### MINI-BOSS CRAB

NOT tamable.

- enormous, ancient cliff or tidal crab
- handcrafted boss-lite AI
- heavy charge → slam → double-snap
- capable of breaking old pier posts
- burrow-under-attack pattern

Often found in:

- sunken ruins
- abandoned docks
- tidal caves

### BOSS CRAB

Dungeon-only:

- multi-phase
- shell-break mechanics
- environment interaction (falling rocks, flooding)

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.3 — TRACKING SIGNS

Crab tracking is unique because they interact with water and sand.

### Tracks

- sideways scuttle prints
- thin lines across sand
- heavy indentation for larger species

### Shell Shards

- cracked pieces from molting
- Rare/Elite shards thicker and patterned

### Burrow Marks

- wet sand mounds
- soft depressions
- bubbling mud holes in marshes

### Claw Marks

- tiny scrape lines on rocks
- gouges on wooden docks (Elite only)

### Tidal Clues

- disrupted shell beds
- half-buried debris
- gunk-algae trails

Crabs are easier to track at low tide.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.4 — AI BEHAVIOR & COMBAT LOGIC

Crabs are burst defenders with strong armor.

### Primary Behaviors

- claw snap (fast, high stagger)
- sideways dodge
- quick burrow → emerge attack
- shell block stance
- group swarm (small crabs)

### Charge Logic

Elite+ tiers sometimes:

- charge forward with claws raised
- slam into legs to stagger prey

### Burrow Logic

Triggers when:

- injured
- overwhelmed
- preparing ambush
- avoiding ranged attacks

### Flee Logic

- Normal: flees at 40%
- Rare: flees at 30%
- Elite: flees at 20%
- Rare Elite: flees at 10%
- Mini-Boss: never flees

### Environmental Mastery

They excel at:

- rock crevices
- shallow water
- brush piles
- wet sand traction

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.5 — WEATHER INTERACTION

### Rain

- increased activity
- marsh crabs emerge from burrows

### Fog

- minimal effect
- visually harder to see

### Storms

- tidal surge → crabs pushed inland
- high-density fights on beaches

### Snow

- only impacts inland tortoises, not crabs
- coastal crab movement slows dramatically

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.6 — COMBAT PROFILE

### Damage

- high stagger from pincers
- slash-type claw injuries
- slam from Elite+
- bleed chance on heavy snap

### Defenses

- excellent front armor
- high resistance to slashing
- weak to blunt, crush-type attacks

### Weaknesses

- soft underbelly
- vulnerable after burrow emergence
- predictable sideways dodge patterns

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.7 — LOOT TABLE

### Normal Crab

- Crab Meat
- Small Shell
- Pincer Fragment

### Rare Crab

- Patterned Shell
- Sharp Claw Piece
- Dense Meat Chunks

### Elite Crab

- Heavy Shell Segment
- Hearty Pincer
- Thick Chitin Plate

### Rare Elite Crab

- Elder Shell Core
- Touch Shell Ridge
- Crab Heart (alchemy)
- Large Pincer Set

### Mini-Boss Crab

- Trophy Shell
- Titan Pincer
- Exceptional Shellplate

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.8 — TAMER COMPANION SUMMARY

Crabs CAN be companions, but only:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite

Rare Elite and Mini-Boss cannot be tamed.

### Companion Role: DEFENSE / DISRUPTION

### Strengths

- great armor
- good control
- strong stagger
- excellent for swamp/coast battles
- very loyal once bonded

### Weaknesses

- poor speed
- terrible in dense forests
- weak against airborne enemies
- poor chase potential

### Companion Behaviors

- Pincer Snap
- Shell Block
- Burrow Guard
- Slam (Elite only)
- Scuttle Disrupt

Crabs are excellent counter-ambush companions.

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8.9 — FAMILY ROLE IN WORLD DESIGN

Crabs provide:

- coastal identity
- wetland hazards
- ambient movement at shorelines
- food supply chain
- chitin-based crafting
- unique companion type
- tidal danger loops

They complete the water-adjacent predator ecosystem.
