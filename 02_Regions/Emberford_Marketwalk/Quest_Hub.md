# Emberford Marketwalk Quest Hub — $quest-hub-stitcher

A river-town hub built around ferry ramps, kiln smoke, and the clamor of open-air stalls. Questlines weave merchants, ferrymen, and ember-kiln crews with relic hunters who follow whispers from the rumor sheets.

## Hub Atmosphere
- Mayor Halda Brine: gruff steward of the quay, always speaking between orders shouted at dockhands.
- Peddler twins Ril and Ressa: finish each other’s sentences while hawking gear bundles and rumor sheets.
- Archivist Torlen: keeps a folding desk near the shrine, trading copied maps for news about lost artifacts.

## Questlines
### Main Thread — "Kiln Soot, River Silver, and the Silent Bell" (Depth-3)
1) **Kiln Soot Samples** — Ril wants fresh kiln soot to judge new Cinder Kilns heat. Players collect Cinderbrew Flask residue and return with notes from kiln workers; Torlen identifies glyphs that match the Dawnstar Talisman etchings.
2) **River Silver Sweep** — Mayor Halda asks for escorts along the ferry run to clear Bramble Urn smugglers. Players retrieve an Ashen Pike used as a contraband marker and recover a Bronzed Ward crate stamped with the Silent Bell sigil.
3) **The Silent Bell Rings** — Torlen reveals the sigil ties to an old shrine bell sunk near Stream caves. Players dive to retrieve the Band of the Blue Stream, seat it in the shrine, and choose to ring the bell (summoning a raid) or keep it muted for stealth bonuses.

### Side Thread — "The Marketwalk Ledger" (Depth-2)
- **Ledger of Owed Favors** — Ressa hands over a smudged ledger linking stall debts to Brood Yarn and Bramble Apple shortages. Players mediate with tailors and alchemists, deciding whether to pay debts or claim crafts.
- **The Sooted Quiver** — Halda flags a caravan needing Briarshot Cartridges and a Bronzed Quiver; escort the caravan or detour through Stoneweald to bargain for better ammo at the cost of time.

### Side Thread — "Ferryfire Warnings" (Depth-2)
- **Firebreak Patrol** — Kiln crews report ember-sprite sparks near the docks. Players carry an Aegis of Amberwake to anchor shields against flare gusts while clearing the line.
- **Night Ferry Riddle** — Archivist Torlen trades a rumor scrap about a missing ferryman whose pockets held a Dawnstar Talisman. Track clues to the Riverlight Delta and decide whether to guide the spirit home or enlist it as a nighttime scout.

## Recurring NPC Notes
- Halda grumbles about tariffs but praises anyone who keeps ferries on schedule; rewards typically include travel discounts and bulk ammo crates.
- Ril and Ressa trade banter about whose pitch works better; they reward cosmetic dyes or stall access.
- Torlen annotates every artifact the party returns, handing out lore snippets pointing deeper upriver.

## Artifacts Circulating Through the Hub
- **Silent Bell Clapper** — shrine component that resonates with the Band of the Blue Stream.
- **Kiln-Scored Ledger Clip** — a soot-dark note clamp that highlights debts tied to Brood Yarn and Bramble Apple shipments.
- **Ferryfire Lantern Hood** — a hooded lamp that dims flame glare, favored by ferrymen running night routes.
- **Quayside Ash Pouch** — charm pouch infused with Ashen Pike filings for steadier polearm grips.
- **River-Scribed Map Slat** — Torlen’s carved map plank pointing toward Stream caves dive spots.
- **Marketwalk Stall Chime** — small chime tuned to Dawnstar Talisman notes, used to call stall attention.

## Hooks to Items and Rumors
