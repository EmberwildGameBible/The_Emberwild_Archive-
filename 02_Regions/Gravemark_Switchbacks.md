# Gravemark Switchbacks

A mid-altitude ridge road carved from collapsed burial cairns now strapped with sled rails and rope bridges. Built by Frostbriar slidecallers after the old pilgrim path was buried, it ties Frostbriar Reach to Glimmerdeep Mire courier runs without facing the summit blizzards.

## Daily Life & Culture
- Cairn-wrights from Frostbriar clans repaint the stone markers each thaw; they leave carved bone tokens for luck and expect travelers to return them on the far cairn.
- Tinker crews from Emberford Marketwalk maintain brake winches and sell [Timberline Sled Rails](../08_Items/Gear/Timberline_Sled_Rails.md) from wagon stalls between bridge anchors.
- Mire-born porters from Glimmerdeep bring Glowspore salves to trade, swearing by the Switchback’s rope-rung ladders that spare them the swamp vapors.

## Micro-Economy & Hazards
- Imports: Glowspore salves and vent gaskets; Exports: sled rails, [Hookbite Signal Flares](../08_Items/Gear/Hookbite_Signal_Flares.md), and bone tokens used as Frostbriar transit scrip.
- Smuggling: Saltmarrow tea bricks are wedged into cairn gaps to dodge Frostbriar tithes, fueling the [Old Road Circuit](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md) reroutes.
- Hazard Sign: See [Gravemark Warning Board](../09_Artifacts/Gravemark_Warning_Board.md) for posted avalanche dice-rolls and slidecaller shifts.

## Travel & Gameplay Hooks
- Origin: Built atop collapsed burial cairns after the Frostbriar Overpass fell, reusing the pilgrims’ stone spine as anchor points for rails and ladders.
- Cultural Tie: Stewarded by the Frostbriar Slidecaller Guild; they mark rails with clan sigils and expect travelers to “tithe a token” at each cairn.
- Gameplay Hooks: Mid-20s sled escort loop tied to [Windbreak Bounty Board](../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md); optional rope-bridge mini-boss “Gravemark Bullyram” drops [Aegis of Amberwake](../08_Items/Gear/Aegis_of_Amberwake.md) fragments.
- Cross-Links: Connects directly to [Frostbriar Reach](./Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Index.md), supports the [Glimmerdeep Shore Hub](../07_Quests/Glimmerdeep_Shore_Hub.md), and uses sled parts from [Timberline Sled Rails](../08_Items/Gear/Timberline_Sled_Rails.md).

## Artifact & Leads
- **Cairn-Lashed Pledge Token** — handed to players who return bone tokens to the final cairn; counts toward Slidecaller reputation and opens sled-skin transmog.
- **Gravemark Warning Board** — updated daily with weather rolls and rope-bridge repair notes; see artifact file for player-readable scrap.
- **Ridge Relay Notice** — rumor slip that points smugglers toward rope-lowered caches; ties back to the [Old Road Circuit](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md).
