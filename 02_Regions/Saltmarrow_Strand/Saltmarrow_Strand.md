# Saltmarrow Strand

A wave-worn peninsula of salt flats, driftwood piers, and barnacle-crusted ruins where fishing crews trade in brine-cured silver and whispered debts. Locals speak in clipped dock slang (“gut-sure” for reliable, “rope-short” for risky) and judge outsiders by how they handle a net.

## Overview
- Sub-areas: Tidecall Piers (working docks), Brineglass Flats (crystal salt pans), Drowned Archive (half-sunk stone stacks), Kelpback Shallows (seaweed forests), and the Windbreak Palisade (driftwood wall with watch platforms).
- Travel notes: Ferries from Emberford run on the turn of the tide; muleskinners avoid the Brineglass glare at midday. Kelpback shoals require pole-prodding to find footing.
- Hazards: Sudden sinkholes where brine pools crust over, salt gnat swarms that clog lantern chimneys, and reefback charges when provoked.
- Local slang: “Spine up” (ready the harpoon), “take the ledger walk” (face the quartermaster), “stray tide” (bad luck day).
- Imports/exports: Imports coarse cloth and casks of bitter tea; exports smoked reefback ribs, saltmarrow bricks for preserving, and kelp-waxed rope treated with [Brine-Tight Sealant](../../08_Items/Professions/Brine-Tight_Sealant.md).
- Cross-links: Crews reference [Saltmarrow Ledger Chain](../../09_Artifacts/Saltmarrow_Ledger_Chain.md) for debts, hunt [Kelpback Bulwark](../../03_Lore/Creatures/Kelpback_Bulwark.md) shells, and supply [Strandline Courier Loop](../../07_Quests/Strandline_Courier_Loop.md).

## Sub-Areas
### Tidecall Piers
Working docks with gull-gray planks, rope ladders, and barrel caches.
- Daily life: nets hung like curtains to dry, children counting reefback teeth, quartermaster chalking tide windows.
- Hooks: quick-access fishmongers selling [Saltmarrow Spined Pole](../../08_Items/Fishing/Saltmarrow_Spined_Pole.md); gnat-smudge braziers reduce swarm debuffs.

### Brineglass Flats
Salt pans that flash white in sun and blue at dusk.
- Daily life: pan-scrapers singing time, briners trading jokes about “glass-feet,” carts hauling slabs to the drying sheds.
- Hooks: crystal shards fuel [Brineglass Pickling Stone](../../08_Items/Cooking/Brineglass_Pickling_Stone.md) recipes; thin crusts hide ankle-deep brine pools.

### Drowned Archive
Barnacle-bitten pillars from a forgotten tower.
- Daily life: scholars copying runes onto wax cloth, divers bargaining for breathleaf, elders forbidding bell-ringing at night.
- Hooks: archaeology nodes for [Tide-Etched Marker Tabs](../../09_Artifacts/Tide-Etched_Marker_Tabs.md); chance to spawn [Archive Stonetongue](../../03_Lore/Creatures/Archive_Stonetongue.md).

### Kelpback Shallows
Dense kelp forests where reefbacks graze.
- Daily life: long-haft poles used to part kelp, shell-pickers arguing over territory, tin bells tied to nets to scare off eels.
- Hooks: gather [Kelpback Binding Straps](../../08_Items/Crafting/Kelpback_Binding_Straps.md); repeatable [Kelp Sweep](../../07_Quests/Kelp_Sweep.md) quests run here.

### Windbreak Palisade
Driftwood wall reinforced with anchor chains.
- Daily life: night watch rotates by lantern clock, children carving windward charms, smuggled tea hidden in rope coils.
- Hooks: watch duty posts generate [Windbreak Bounty Board](../../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md) tasks; hazard of salt gnat blight when lanterns run low.

## Settlements
### Marrowhook
A tide-timed fishing town built on stilted lanes.
- Vendors: Quartermaster Lysa Pine sells brinecloth, hooks, and [Marrowhook Ledger Dockets](../../09_Artifacts/Marrowhook_Ledger_Dockets.md); Cook Bren Olm trades [Salt-Sear Chowder](../../08_Items/Cooking/Salt-Sear_Chowder.md); Netwright Joft repairs poles for reefback scales.
- Economy: pays crews in saltmarrow bricks redeemable for supplies; visitors barter reefback plates and [Brineglass Vent Caps](../../08_Items/Crafting/Brineglass_Vent_Caps.md).

### Hookbite Lookout
A storm-worn outpost on the palisade.
- Vendors: Scout Rinna offers [Hookbite Signal Flares](../../08_Items/Gear/Hookbite_Signal_Flares.md); Scribe Dov keeps [Lookout Rumor Slips](../../09_Artifacts/Lookout_Rumor_Slips.md) pinned on the post.
- Economy: rewards patrols with rope rations and tea bricks; trades salt gnat sacks to alchemists for [Gnat-Smother Salve](../../08_Items/Crafting/Gnat-Smother_Salve.md).

## Repeatable Activity — Strandline Courier Loop
A rotating courier circuit between Tidecall Piers, Brineglass Flats, and Hookbite Lookout.
- Flow: pick up wax-sealed bundles, carry them across salt pans while avoiding sinkhole markers, deliver at lantern posts.
- Gameplay hook: repeatable for saltmarrow bricks and [Courier’s Brine Token](../../08_Items/Trinkets/Couriers_Brine_Token.md); risks increase during dusk fog.
