# Greatwood Zone Index

Core references for Greatwood routes, lodge ties, and warded forests.

## Overview
Greatwood is a temperate woodland webbed with trade spurs and root-sung shrines. Wardens guard the ferry lines while smugglers test every hollow for hidden freight. Trails weave between sap collectors, shrine-keepers, and quarry-haulers who all listen for the forest's whisperline songs.

## 2026-01-04 — Whisperline Slice Locations
- **Whisperline Hearthpost (safe settlement):** Lodge-adjacent clearing where wardens billet smugglers who surrender. Sapbroker Neral issues field notes from a chalk-stained table beside the communal fire.
- **Sapsong Crossing (safe settlement):** Rope-bridged hamlet at the shallow ford. Children hum root-songs to test the old wards while caravans swap resin bundles before the night road.
- **Bramble-Echo Thicket (wild zone):** Dense briar pocket where sound carries twice; smugglers trail mirrored echoes to confuse patrols. Resin spores cling to cloaks and stain packs amber.
- **Mirebreath Run (wild zone):** Low bog channel that exhales cold mist at dusk. Wardens post lantern stakes; smugglers prefer to move sap crates across its slick stones.
- **Root-Song Shrine (mystic site):** Hollowed trunk with carved hymn-lines. Wardscribe Istra rewrites chalk sigils daily to keep sap spirits quiet.
- **Sapswell Luminarium (mystic site):** Sunken basin where sap pools glow green. Root-binders practice whisper-harvesting to avoid waking the elder roots beneath.
- **Whisperline Stonebridge (trade-road landmark):** Mossed stone arch on the old courier road. Driftcart peddlers shelter beneath and swap news carved into the bridge ribs.
- **Hollow Verge Encampment (hidden hostile camp):** Camouflaged tarps and resin tar pits hug a cliff lip. Lia Corrin's smugglers stockpile seized permits and route maps here.

## Notes
- Wardens treat whisperline songs as living ledgers; smugglers mimic them to mask contraband shipments.
- Sap surges coincide with market festivals; inventories shift when the Sapswell brightens.
