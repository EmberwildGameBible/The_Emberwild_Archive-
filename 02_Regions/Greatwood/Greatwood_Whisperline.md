# Greatwood — Whisperline Corridor (2026-01-04)

## RUN_DATE — Whisperline Corridor
- Region mood: resin-scented, whisper-carried news, road tensions between wardens and smugglers.

### Settlements
1. **Sapstring Crossing**
   - Reached by following the plank road west of the main Greatwood trunk before it narrows into the Whisperline.
   - Safe hearth run by wardens; patrol whistles echo at dawn and dusk.
   - Hazard: occasional vermin under floorboards when sap floods.
   - Quest Hook: Ellas asks for **Sapstring Bandage** materials to refill caches.
2. **Thornbar Bivouac**
   - Trail split south of **Fallen Cart Bend**; rough tents ring a smoky firepit.
   - Hazard: smugglers pull watchers from the road to shake them down.
   - Quest Hook: Ril wants forged **Smudged Route Permits** to slip cargo past checkpoints.

### Road Landmarks
3. **Whisperline Milepost**
   - First carved post with notched distances; sits at a bend where whispers travel oddly.
   - Hazard: pranksters carve false directions; sap drips make it slick.
   - Quest Hook: Leave **Roadling Trade Tokens** to earn safe passage.
4. **Chorus Bridge**
   - Rope-and-timber bridge over a shallow stream; boards sing when crossed.
   - Hazard: boards loosen in storms, forcing slower travel.
   - Quest Hook: Fix the bridge with **Coiled Line Spools** to shorten escort timers.
5. **Fallen Cart Bend**
   - Hairpin turn with a toppled cart left as warning; oxen avoid it in the rain.
   - Hazard: slick mud that delays mounts; thieves hide in the cart bed.
   - Quest Hook: Retrieve **Resin Patch Kits** dropped by last caravan.

### Wild Hunting/Gather Areas
6. **Resin Tangle**
   - Dense sapling knot full of pitch oozes; accessed by ducking under leaning trunks north of the road.
   - Hazard: sap-strider nests that slow movement if disturbed.
   - Quest Hook: Collect pitch for **Sap-Resin Salves**.
7. **Lowlight Shroom Beds**
   - Damp hollow east of the milepost where faint shrooms glow blue.
   - Hazard: spores blur vision unless filtered.
   - Quest Hook: Gather caps for **Lowlight Shroom Tea**.
8. **Hollow Sap Grove**
   - Hollowed trees tapped with clay spouts; cairn songs keep sap flowing.
   - Hazard: tapping wrong rhythms angers wardstones.
   - Quest Hook: Harvest bark for **Ward-Chalk Packets**.

### Mystic / Ward Sites
9. **Murmur Wardstone**
   - Standing stone wrapped in cloth strips; hum shifts with nearby songs.
   - Hazard: Resonant hum drains stamina when ignored.
   - Quest Hook: Apply fresh sigils using **Murmurstone Charms**.
10. **Rootsong Cairn**
    - Stone cairn with etched grooves that match old root-songs.
    - Hazard: Echoing whispers attract prowlers at dusk.
    - Quest Hook: Use a **Rootsong Listening Horn** to align grooves.

### Hostile Camps
11. **Smuggler's Knot Camp**
    - Hidden side camp south of **Chorus Bridge** with rope ladders into gullies.
    - Hazard: hooks swing across the path to unseat riders.
    - Quest Hook: Recover **Smuggler's Knot Hooks** for wardens.
12. **Bracken Snare Ring**
    - Bramble ring laced with snares west of **Thornbar Bivouac**.
