# CLASSIC ROUTES - LEVEL BANDS & HUB LOOPS

A quick reference for classic-style leveling paths. Each band lists zone pairs, hub-to-hub loops, dungeon entry points, and travel notes so groups can plan without breaking immersion.

## LEVEL 1–10: HOMESTEAD & FRONTIER
- **Zones:** Starter homeland + adjacent lowland (ex: Greenhearth → Ridgefield).
- **Hubs:** Village square, lumber camp, riverside dock.
- **Loops:**
  - Kill/collect circuits around the farmsteads (boars, wolves, thistles).
  - Delivery run between village and dock to introduce flightpath/boat.
- **Dungeon Hook:** Tiny 3-boss cave with bandits or kobolds; tutorial group content.
- **Travel Notes:** Walking only; set hearth at the starting inn.

## LEVEL 10–20: BORDER WARDENS
- **Zones:** Borderlands + swamp/mire (ex: Ridgefield → Mirefen).
- **Hubs:** Watchpost keep, swamp ferry, hunter’s lodge.
- **Loops:**
  - Palisade defense chain (ties to “Broken Watchpost” questline).
  - Swamp herb/ingredient gathers feeding early cooking recipes.
- **Dungeon Hook:** Swamp crypt with undead; introduces disease/poison cures.
- **Travel Notes:** Flightpaths unlock; first land mounts near 18–20.

## LEVEL 20–30: HEARTLAND CIRCUIT
- **Zones:** Heartland plains + high forest (ex: Goldtrail → Highbough).
- **Hubs:** Trade crossroads, druidic grove, caravan halt.
- **Loops:**
  - Caravan escort that rotates weekly between three routes.
  - Elite beast hunts (ties to “Bramble Vale” group quest).
- **Dungeon Hook:** Forest keep or satyr ruin; introduces interrupt/silence mechanics.
- **Travel Notes:** Boats/zeppelins connect to opposite continent; inn circuit wide enough to matter.

## LEVEL 30–40: PEAKS & FRONTLINES
- **Zones:** Alpine ridge + contested front (ex: Frosthorn → Emberfront).
- **Hubs:** Mountain watchtower, siege camp, skyport.
- **Loops:**
  - Weather-based quests (lightning towers, frost wards) alongside Stormbound Courier routes.
  - Daily skirmishes that grant reputations with frontline factions.
- **Dungeon Hook:** Mid-tier stronghold or artillery works; emphasizes line-of-sight pulls.
- **Travel Notes:** Mid-speed mounts common; class travel perks start to matter.

## LEVEL 40–50: DESERT & RUIN
- **Zones:** Shattered desert + buried city (ex: Duneveil → Sunken Archive).
- **Hubs:** Oasis inn, excavation camp, airship tether.
- **Loops:**
  - Relic digsites with rotating elites and puzzle locks.
  - Caravan supply lines vulnerable to raiders; weekly world boss caravan.
- **Dungeon Hook:** Ruined library or bug hive; poison/bleed-heavy with cleanse checks.
- **Travel Notes:** Portals appear in capitals; gryphon/wyvern lines crisscross desert mesas.

## LEVEL 50–60: WARFRONT MARCH
- **Zones:** Blighted front + capital approach (ex: Blackwall → Ember Crown).
- **Hubs:** Forward command, sanctum, siege docks.
- **Loops:**
  - Attunement chain for endgame raid (collect banners, attune at shrines, craft key).
  - Rotating invasion events that flip control of towers and travel nodes.
- **Dungeon Hook:** 10-player launch raid wing or outdoor elite citadel.
- **Travel Notes:** Epic mounts; portal rings with cooldowns; summoning stones outside raids.

## TRAVEL REMINDERS
- Keep hearthstones in the most central inn of your current band.
- Unlock every flightpath on entry; classic routes assume no flying mounts.
- Consider stacking cooking/first aid quests with travel loops to maximize time-on-foot value.
