Emberwild: Travel Pace, Mount Tiers, Weight Rules & World-Distance Logic

This appendix defines:

- Travel speeds
- Mount tiers
- Movement penalties
- Terrain friction
- Stamina drain on long movement
- Weight/encumbrance rules
- Spirit Realm traversal interactions
- When fast-travel is allowed (almost never)
- Real Classic-style global travel pacing

This is the ONLY source of truth for movement & travel.

---

# G.0 PURPOSE

This appendix establishes how players move through the world:

- On foot
- On mounts
- Through biomes
- Across elevation
- Via limited fast-travel

Travel pacing is core to world identity and cannot contradict Chapter 1’s “dangerous, persistent world” pillar.

---

# G.1 BASE MOVEMENT SPEED

Base unmounted speed for all players:

### 7 yards / second

(This mirrors Classic WoW’s 7 y/s movement baseline.)

This is affected by:

- Terrain
- Debuffs
- Encumbrance
- Weather (optional region-specific)
- Spirit Realm interference (Appendix H)

---

# G.2 MOUNT SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Mounts follow Classic-inspired rules:

- No mount in combat
- No mount indoors (except stable hubs)
- Mounts have summon cast time
- Mounts break on damage
- Mounts require riding skill
- Mounts cost significant gold
- Mounts can be dismounted by projectile attacks
- No instant “whistle” or modern remounting

### G.2.1 Mount Tiers

| Tier | Riding Skill | Speed Bonus | Typical Level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | Basic Riding | +60% | ~Level 20–25 | Slow early-game mounts |
| Tier 2 | Advanced Riding | +100% | ~Level 40 | Classic midgame mounts |
| Tier 3 | Expert Riding | +150% | ~Level 60 | Endgame mounts, expensive |
| Tier 4 | Heritage/Unique | 150–200% | Non-standard | Rare/epic biome mounts |

No flying, no riding anywhere that breaks world friction.

---

# G.3 MOUNT STABLES & STORAGE

Mounts are physical assets:

- Stored in stables
- Limited stable slots (expandable via gold)
- Each mount has type, temperament & terrain bonuses

Mounts are NOT:

- Auto-summoned
- Account-wide
- Cosmetic-only

They are gameplay tools, not toys.

---

# G.4 MOUNT TERRAIN LOGIC

Each mount family has terrain strengths/weaknesses:

### 1. Horses / Plainsbeasts

- Best speed on flat ground
- Penalized heavily in snow, mud, dense forest
- Cannot traverse extreme cliffs

### 2. Tundra Yaks / Toughbeasts

- Strong in snow & cold
- Slower on plains
- High stamina

### 3. Swamp Lizards

- No penalty in wetlands
- Penalized on rock
- Great traction

### 4. Highland Goats / Rams

- Best for cliffs
- Worst for deep water
- Cannot be knocked off steep edges easily

### 5. Desert Runners

- Fastest mounts in the game on sand
- Severe penalties outside desert

### 6. Spirit Mounts (later game)

- Ignore some terrain
- Require spirit attunement
- Cannot exist permanently outside rituals

---

# G.5 TERRAIN MODIFIERS (ALL MOVEMENT)

Movement speed is modified by environmental conditions:

| Terrain | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Roads | +10% |
| Plains | baseline |
| Shallow water | -10% |
| Thick brush | -15% |
| Deep snow | -20% |
| Swamp | -25% |
| Rocky inclines | -30% |
| Cliffs | Mount-type specific |
| Sand dunes | -10% unless desert mount |
| Spirit Realm flux zones | variable (Appendix H) |

These penalties apply to mounted AND unmounted movement.

The world must feel geographic and physical.

---

# G.6 ENCOUNTERING ENEMIES ON MOUNT

Rules:

1. Taking any damage dismounts the player.
2. Certain enemies have ranged “mount breakers.”
3. Mount HP is not a system.
    - Instead, mount breaks instantly on hit.
4. Some elite predators have mount-charge attacks
    - Player is knocked off
    - Slight daze applied
    - Mount returns to stables (if within safety radius)

This reinforces:

- Travel danger
- Route planning
- Scouting
- Pull management

No modern safety mechanics.

---

# G.7 ENCUMBRANCE & WEIGHT SYSTEM

Inspired by Classic’s “bag weight” feel without annoying micromanagement.

### G.7.1 Encumbrance Definition

If the player carries too much weight:

- Movement speed reduces
- Stamina regen reduces
- Mounts refuse to move at full speed

Weight comes from:

- Materials
- Metals/ores
- Heavy gear
- Unprocessed hides
- Bulk ammo

### G.7.2 Encumbrance Breakpoints

| State | Description | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | Under 70% carry capacity | None |
| Burdened | 70–90% | -10% movement |
| Heavy | 90–110% | -25% movement, -25% stamina regen |
| Overweight | 110–150% | -50% movement, -50% stamina regen, no sprint |
| Immobilized | 150%+ | Cannot move |

This makes gathering, crafting, and adventuring meaningful.

---

# G.8 FAST-TRAVEL RULES

Very limited.

### Allowed Only:

- Spirit shrines (unlockable per region)
- Paid caravans (slow, on-rails transport)
- Rare, expensive mage-run portals
- Heritage lodge “hearthstones” (long cooldown)

### Never Allowed:

- Free global teleports
- Instant dungeon teleports
- Flight paths
- Flying mounts
- Teleport stones

This keeps the world connected and dangerous.

---

# G.9 WEATHER & WORLD CONDITIONS

Weather affects movement:

- Snowstorms → -15%
- Sandstorms → -10% + random drift
- Heavy rain → -10% mount traction
- Fog → no speed penalty, but visibility reduced

Optional global events (later appendices) may alter speed further.

---

# G.10 SPIRIT REALM MOVEMENT (HOOK ONLY)

Spirit Realm affects:

- Movement speed
- Line of sight
- Gravity
- Terrain solidity

Full rules appear in Appendix H.

---

# G.11 DESIGN LOCKS

Travel systems must obey:

- No instant movement
- No trivial mount access
- No combat mounting
- Mounts break on hit
- Terrain matters
- Weight matters
- Weather matters
- Routes matter
- Spirit Realm creates dual-map movement
- Danger persists even with mounts

These cannot be violated.
