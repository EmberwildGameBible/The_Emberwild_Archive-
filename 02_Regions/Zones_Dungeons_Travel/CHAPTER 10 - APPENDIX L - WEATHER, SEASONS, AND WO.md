# CHAPTER 10 — APPENDIX L

# WEATHER & SEASONS SYSTEM

Emberwild Game Bible v4.1 — COMPLETE REWRITE

This rewrite fits perfectly with:

- your grounded realism
- your new creature tiers
- your tracking-first world
- Classic-WoW pacing
- Red Dead–inspired environmental immersion
- the Spirit Realm rewrite
- your design philosophy of “slow, heavy, believable”

This is now the FINAL canon version of Emberwild’s weather and seasonal simulation.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# APPENDIX L — WEATHER & SEASONS

“Weather is the second predator.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.0 — PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM

Weather and seasons in Emberwild are not cosmetic.

They shape:

- tracking
- creature behavior
- movement
- scent trails
- stamina
- crafting
- alchemy
- fishing
- profession yield
- visibility
- world danger profile

The goal is to create a world that feels alive and natural, but without adding supernatural or magical effects.

Weather = survival.

Seasons = world identity.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.1 — WEATHER PHILOSOPHY

Weather in Emberwild is:

- grounded
- predictable (to an extent)
- region-dependent
- tied to real-world survival principles
- readable by players who understand nature

Weather is NOT:

- magical
- meta
- combat-based
- spell-driven
- extreme fantasy
- unpredictable chaos

This keeps your world believable and immersive.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.2 — WEATHER TYPES

Every region has a weather profile with frequency curves and intensity brackets.

Emberwild uses 8 universal weather states:

### 1. Clear

- best visibility
- best tracking
- stable encounters
- standard gathering

### 2. Overcast

- dim light
- animals more relaxed
- better stealth
- slightly reduced detection ranges

### 3. Light Rain

- softens footprints (easier to track fresh ones)
- mud slows creature and player movement
- scent trails degrade slowly
- fishing quality increases

### 4. Heavy Rain

- harsh movement slowdown
- scent trails heavily disrupted
- footprints vanish quickly
- small predators retreat
- large predators roam more boldly
- ranged weapon misfire chance (powder dampness)

### 5. Fog / Mist

- drastically reduced visibility
- animals spook easier
- tracking becomes high-risk, high-reward
- ambush predators roam more aggressively
- ranged combat becomes unreliable

### 6. Snow

- tracks preserved for long durations
- scent trails minimal
- stamina drains faster
- cold damage if unprepared
- animals migrate to dens

### 7. Storm (Non-Magical)

A storm is:

- heavy rain
- wind gusts
- thunder in the distance

Effects:

- creatures flee to cover
- den-based creatures become aggressive
- tracking becomes extremely unreliable
- torches/campfires blow out
- lightning only a visual/audio effect (no magic)

### 8. Heatwave

- stamina loss greatly increased
- thirst mechanics lightly emphasized
- carnivores hunt less during day
- scavengers are more active
- fishing becomes harder in shallow water

Every weather type changes behavior across the map.

# SECTION L.3 — WEATHER EFFECTS ON GAMEPLAY

Here is the concrete effect weather has on specific systems.

---

## A. Tracking

Clear: easiest

Rain: washes tracks, reduces scent

Fog: obscures tracks visually

Snow: preserves prints but removes scent

Storm: destroys most signs

Heatwave: cracks soil, makes tracks deeper but scent sharper

---

## B. Creature Behavior

Weather changes wildlife:

### Rain

- small predators stay hidden
- large predators roam
- grazers travel in tighter herds

### Snow

- animals conserve energy
- predators hunt at dusk/dawn
- rare creatures may be forced into unusual paths

### Fog

- ambush predators become deadlier
- herds spook easily
- scavengers gather near kill sites

### Storm

- erratic creature patterns
- dens become high-danger areas

### Heatwave

- daytime activity drops
- nighttime activity increases

---

## C. Player Stamina / Movement

### Rain / Mud

- stamina drain +10%
- movement slow +5–10% depending on terrain

### Snow

- stamina drain +15%
- movement slow +10–20%

### Heatwave

- stamina drain +20%

### Storm Winds

- slows ranged accuracy
- slightly reduces movement speed

---

## D. Crafting / Professions

### Herbalism

- rain increases herb bloom rates
- snow halts most herb growth
- fog encourages fungus growth

### Fishing

- rain = best yields
- fog = calmer fish
- storm = worst yields
- heatwave = poor shallow-water fishing

### Cooking

- campfire intensity affected by rain/wind

### Alchemy

- some spirit plants only usable in specific seasons or weather

---

## E. Visibility / Lighting

### Fog:

- lowest visibility
- torches bloom heavily
- lantern range reduced

### Storm:

- brief lightning flashes reveal silhouettes
- not magical
- purely atmospheric

### Snow:

- ambient brightness increased
- footstep sound differences helpful

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.4 — SEASONS SYSTEM

Emberwild uses a simple but powerful 4-season structure.

Seasons change every 1–2 weeks real-time (tunable).

## 1. Spring

- highest herb yield
- rainfall frequent
- small predators active
- companions bond faster
- Rare creatures migrate

## 2. Summer

- heatwaves possible
- water sources reduce
- predators lethargic daytime
- scavengers hyperactive
- Elite creatures expand territory

## 3. Autumn

- fog is common
- tracking highly variable
- grazers fatten up and travel
- hunting is best in early morning
- Rare Elite creatures appear more frequently

## 4. Winter

- snow in cold regions
- slow creature movement
- migration routes activate
- difficult survival conditions
- Mini-Boss den behavior more predictable

Seasons DO NOT cause:

- magical events
- spell storms
- fantasy weather
- arcane anomalies

Everything is grounded in survival realism.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.5 — REGIONAL WEATHER PROFILES

Every region has its own weather weightings.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.6 — WEATHER IMPACT ON RARITIES

Weather modifies how Rare / Elite / Rare Elite creatures behave:

### Rain

- Rare creatures move more
- Elite roam wide
- Rare Elite show up near water

### Fog

- Rare Elites become extremely stealthy
- Mini-Bosses stay near dens

### Snow

- Elite creatures slow dramatically
- Rare creatures migrate to resource-rich zones

### Storm

- Rare Elites may relocate unpredictably
- some Rare spawn windows shift

Nothing supernatural — only natural world logic.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.7 — WEATHER & THE SPIRIT REALM

Spirit Sight is affected by weather:

### Rain

- echoes blur
- footprints streak

### Fog

- spirit silhouettes sharpen (contrast with fog)

### Snow

- spirit footsteps stand out visually
- long-term trails appear

### Storm

- heavy interference, Eye has a reduced duration

Weather NEVER adds magic to Spirit Sight.

It only alters clarity.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION L.8 — DESIGN INTENT

The goal of weather and seasons is to:

- create a living world
- force players to adapt
- make certain hunts harder or easier
- vary resources organically
- give each region identity
- encourage realism and immersion
- deepen tracking gameplay
- avoid all fantasy or “spell weather” tropes

This system makes Emberwild feel like an ecosystem, not a theme park.
