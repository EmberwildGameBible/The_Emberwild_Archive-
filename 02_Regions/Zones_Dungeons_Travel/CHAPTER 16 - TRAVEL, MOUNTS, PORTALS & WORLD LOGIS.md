# CHAPTER 16 — TRAVEL, MOUNTS & WORLD LOGISTICS

Emberwild Game Bible v4.1 — Final, Clean, Grounded Version

(Contains zero magic, zero spirit travel, zero supernatural mechanics. Fully aligned with Chapters 1–15 and all v4.1 world rules.)

────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────

# 16.0 — PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

Travel defines the pace, danger, and physicality of Emberwild.

This chapter establishes:

- How players move through the world
- Mount progression
- Road networks
- Caravans and ferries
- Natural shortcuts
- Camps, inns, lodges, lodestones
- Encumbrance and carrying limits
- Terrain hazards
- Late-game quality-of-life systems

Traversal must feel:

- deliberate,
- dangerous,
- slow when unprepared,
- meaningful,
- grounded,
- and part of the gameplay loop, not a tax to skip.

No magical shortcuts.

No teleportation convenience.

No world-skipping.

The world remains large, physical, and dangerous at every stage.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.1 — CORE TRAVEL PRINCIPLES

## 16.1.1 Travel Is Gameplay

Movement is a form of encounter design.

Players must consider:

- wildlife patrols
- terrain angles
- weather
- visibility
- stamina regen
- safe paths vs dangerous shortcuts
- road vs wilderness
- camping and supplies
- return routes

Travel is not meant to be minimized —

It is meant to be mastered.

## 16.1.2 No Free Teleports

There is no:

- dungeon finder
- town portal
- global fast-travel
- instant recall
- magical warps
- mount summoning indoors

All movement must be earned and grounded in geography.

## 16.1.3 Distance Always Matters

Regions are physically connected.

Travel includes:

- mountain passes
- snow fields
- desert heat
- predator-dense forests
- swamp choke paths
- storm-exposed ridges

Crossing the world requires planning.

Late-game convenience never replaces the world itself.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.2 — TRAVEL MODES (FULL v4.1)

There are four travel types in Emberwild.

1. Walking / Sprinting
2. Mounts (Lv 30 / Lv 60)
3. Regional Caravans & Ferries
4. Mechanical Gateways (non-magical, short-range, expensive)

Spirit travel, spirit fissures, magic pathways, and supernatural movement are not part of the v4.1 system.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.3 — BASE MOVEMENT

## Walking

All classes share identical walking speed.

## Sprinting

Universal ability:

- +20% movement speed
- lasts 4 seconds
- 30s cooldown
- breaks if struck

It is NOT a combat mobility skill.

It is a navigation / repositioning tool.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.4 — MOUNTS

Fully grounded, Classic-style mount progression.

## 16.4.1 Mount Tiers

Tier 1 Mount — “Basic Mount”

- Unlock: Level 30
- Speed: +60%
- Cost: meaningful gold (in line with slow economy)
- Regional variants (visual + minor terrain handling differences)

Tier 2 Mount — “Trained Mount”

- Unlock: Level 60
- Speed: +100%
- Cost: very expensive gold
- Requires: regional reputation discount or special license

## 16.4.2 Realism Rules

- No flying mounts
- No instant mounting
- Mount breaks on damage
- Cannot mount in dungeons, caves, dense foliage, or water
- Some terrain slows mounts (snow, mud, steep slopes)

## 16.4.3 Mount Acquisition

Mounts come from:

- breeders
- caravans
- heritage lodges
- regional achievements
- rare world spawns (cosmetic variants)

Some extremely uncommon cosmetic coats can originate from creature families players raise or rescue, but never magical.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.5 — REGIONAL CARAVANS & FERRIES

Caravans replace modern “flight masters,” using Classic philosophy.

## Features

- Physical wagons on established road networks
- Move on fixed schedules
- Can be boarded for a fee
- Slower than a mount, but safer than walking
- Cannot be teleported to
- Travel between towns, outposts, and frontier nodes
- Subject to weather and World Pulses (storms slow them; predator migrations alter danger nearby)

## Escort Logic

Caravans are NPC-controlled and cannot be destroyed,

but they can be attacked, requiring players to choose whether to assist caravan guards.

Passengers are safe on board and cannot be targeted directly.

## Ferries

Some coastal regions use:

- small boats
- dock-to-dock ferries
- river barges

Same rules as caravans:

NO instant travel, NO magic, grounded only.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.6 — MECHANICAL GATEWAYS (NON-MAGICAL FAST TRAVEL)

Replaces all “portal magic” or “spirit pathway” concepts.

These are ancient mechanical lifts, pulley systems, winches, rail carts, and stone gates built by old frontier cultures.

## Design

- Short-range only (never cross-region)
- Must be physically discovered
- Require paid maintenance tokens sold in towns
- Have cooldowns
- Output points are fixed
- Only between two real-world physical locations

Examples:

- Mountain winch lifts
- Cliffside ropeway gates
- Minecart tunnels between two shafts
- Desert wind-sled rails
- Coastal tidegate elevators

They are tools, not magic.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.7 — CAMPS, INNS & RESTING POINTS

## 16.7.1 Player Camps

Crafted temporary shelters:

- resting regen bonus
- cooking access
- small camp chest (minimal storage)
- despawns after a set time
- cannot be placed near dungeons, lairs, elite zones, or rare routes

## 16.7.2 Inns / Lodges / Heritage Halls

Permanent facilities:

- rest bonus
- repairs
- vendors
- trainers
- bank access
- profession tools
- social hubs
- bed rentals

These anchor the world’s travel rhythm.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.8 — ENCUMBRANCE & CARRY LIMITS

Realism-based.

## 16.8.1 Weight Limit

Carrying capacity is determined by:

- Strength
- Bag quality
- Belts, harnesses, pouches

## 16.8.2 Overburden Effects

If overweight:

- movement slows
- sprint disabled
- mount use disabled
- dodge chance reduced
- stamina regen reduced
- climbing/steep slopes become impossible

## 16.8.3 Purpose

Enforces:

- inventory management
- returning to town
- meaningful pack decisions
- deliberate gathering, not hoarding

No magical bags.

No infinite storage.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.9 — WEATHER & TERRAIN IMPACT (LINKED TO CH. 14)

Travel integrates directly with Chapter 14.

### Movement Impacts

- snow slows travel
- sandstorms cut visibility and speed
- swamp mud reduces mount traction
- heat reduces stamina regen
- fog hides predators and reduces safe pathing

### Navigation Impacts

- storms slow caravans
- blizzards alter predator patrol routes
- migration pulses shift safe vs unsafe roads
- mountain winds affect climbing

All grounded environmental effects.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.10 — ROAD NETWORKS

Roads provide:

- safer enemy spawn weights
- faster base movement
- caravan and guard patrol routes
- fewer predators

Leaving roads or entering wilderness:

- increases creature density
- increases rare encounter chances
- increases ambush risk
- slows movement due to terrain

Classic World logic, never safe, always physical.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.11 — WORLD LOCKS & PASS GATES

Certain regions require progression:

- keys
- faction reputation
- killing a world boss
- completing a regional dungeon
- repairing ancient lifts or gates

All progression is physical, not magical.

Gates are mechanical.

Keys are metal or crafted.

Nothing teleports you.

────────────────────────────────

# 16.12 — DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (v4.1 LOCK)

All travel systems must obey:

1. No magical travel
2. No spirit pathways
3. No teleporting
4. No world skipping
5. No flying mounts
6. No mounts indoors
7. No infinite inventory
8. No convenience systems beyond late-game mechanical tools
9. World must remain large and dangerous
10. Weather must meaningfully matter
11. Distance is part of progression

If a mechanic bypasses or shortcuts ANY of these, it is invalid.
