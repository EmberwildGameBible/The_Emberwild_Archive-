# Frostbriar_Reach

**Origin/Provenance:** Frontier ridge east of Saltmarrow Strand, settled by Windbreak timber crews and snow-herders following the thaw routes.

**Cultural Tie:** Windbreak watchposts and Marrowhook haulers trade cedar resin and frost-ferns; locals keep to clipped phrases like “mind the briar” and call outsiders “warm-mitts.”

**Gameplay Hook:** Mid-20s leveling stretch with chill exposure, caravan escort circuits, and timber-haul world quests that reward cold-weather tools and dungeon keys for Ashen Cry Grotto.

**Overview:** Frostbriar Reach is a wind-scoured conifer belt where ice-rimed briars snag pack lines and echo with elk bugles. Snowmelt rivulets hide frost fern clusters prized by herbalists. Timber slides connect rough camps to the main trail, but ashbound cultists stalk the ridgeline at night.

**Travel & Hazards:**
- Narrow ice ledges; players must cross wind shear zones that inflict chill stacks unless carrying briar-sap salves.
- Timber slide shortcuts offer speed at the risk of avalanche-spawned foes.
- Snow squall events obscure visibility and spawn “White Howl” packs.

**Slang & Voice:**
- “Briar-bitten” = frost-nicked and unlucky.
- “Slide fast, slide flat” shouted before timber sled runs.
- “Ash breath” used for cultists hiding smoke-scent charms.
