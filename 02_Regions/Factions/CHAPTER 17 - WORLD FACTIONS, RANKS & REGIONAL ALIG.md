# CHAPTER 17 — WORLD FACTIONS & REGIONAL POWERS

Emberwild Game Bible v4.1 — Final Version

This chapter defines all major socio-political groups that shape the world of Emberwild.

Factions in Emberwild operate under three principles:

- Grounded (no magic, no supernatural worship)
- Regional (tied to homeland terrain & history)
- Classic-Era Tension (territorial, survival-based conflicts)

Factions influence:

- questlines
- regional safety
- rare creature protection laws
- caravan routes
- dungeon ownership
- regional crafting advancements
- player progression at mid/late game

There are no global, world-spanning alliances.

Emberwild is fragmented, local, grounded — Classic-inspired.

────────────────────────────────

# 17.0 — PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER

To establish:

- The world’s political landscape
- How regions interact
- What groups control which biomes
- How factions impact gameplay
- Territory conflict
- Profession hubs
- Dungeon ownership
- Rare-beast protection/poaching dynamics

Factions do not represent classes.

They represent cultures, economies, and territorial realities.

Factions fall into three structural categories:

### Tier A — Regional Powers (Homeland Governments)
