# Thornlash Palisade

A timber-and-rope palisade guarding the only dry chokepoint between Saltmarrow Strand’s flats and the Frostbriar slides. Classic ferry crews remember it as the "old wall" before sled rails were cut; today it’s a watchpost for smugglers and ashbound scouts alike.

## Daily Life & Culture
- Morning bell shifts pull dockhands from [Saltmarrow Strand](./Saltmarrow_Strand/Saltmarrow_Strand.md) to stack brineglass sandbags under the wall; every third bag hides a corked prayer slip for the tide spirits.
- Midday, Frostbriar sledders trade rope grease for kelp rations, quoting the Slidecaller motto "leave a token, earn a ride" while carving tally marks into gate beams.
- Nightfall belongs to the tea vendors and dice players; they prop lanterns on spear racks and wager on who hears the [Thornlash Prowler](../03_Lore/Creatures/Thornlash_Prowler.md) howl first.

## Micro-Economy & Hazards
- Imports: briar resin and rope grease from [Frostbriar Reach](./Frostbriar_Reach/Zone_Index.md); Exports: pitch-lined crates and smuggled sea salt bricks bound for the [Old Road Circuit](../07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md).
- Smuggling: Marrowhook runners wedge contraband herbs beneath the palisade’s plank seams; the [Sentry Ration Docket](../09_Artifacts/Sentry_Ration_Docket.md) lists which crates escaped inspection.
- Hazard Sign: See [Thornlash Warning Slate](../09_Artifacts/Thornlash_Warning_Slate.md) posted near the rope bridge; it notes ash drift gusts that can rip sled rails loose.

## Travel & Gameplay Hooks
- Origin: Built from reclaimed ship masts after the first Ash Drift pushed ferries inland; reforged when the Slidecaller Guild needed a mid-band rest stop.
- Cultural Tie: Shared post between the Slidecaller Guild and Marrowhook salt traders; each faction brands a plank with its sigil before claiming wall duty.
- Gameplay Hook: Mid-20s quest hub handing out wall repair loops and ash drift hunts; unlocks reputation bonuses with both factions and access to [Thornlash Sentry Wristwraps](../08_Items/Gear/Thornlash_Sentry_Wristwraps.md).
- Cross-Links: Feeds the [Thornlash Palisade Duties](../07_Quests/Thornlash_Palisade_Duties.md) quest chain, ties to [Windbreak Bounty Board](../07_Quests/Windbreak_Bounty_Board.md), and spawns [Thornlash Prowler](../03_Lore/Creatures/Thornlash_Prowler.md) hunts.

## Artifact & Leads
- **Thornlash Warning Slate** — dice-roll weather board for ash drift gusts and rail tensions; updated by Slidecaller lookouts.
- **Sentry Ration Docket** — ration slip bundle noting which crates are sealed, smuggled, or shorted; doubles as a patrol lead for players.
