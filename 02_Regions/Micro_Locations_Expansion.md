# Micro-Locations Expansion

New subzones seeded to support ingredient harvesting, enemy hunts, and contract loops tied to the broader Greatwood and ridge biomes.

## Cinderfen Hot Springs Terraces
- Layout: Stepped geothermal pools with sulfur vents and fire-glass shelves.
- Hooks:
  - Ember Sap Bark nodes overhang scalding vents; harvesting without vent gaskets risks burn DoTs.
  - Ash Myriad raider patrols tether to molten braziers that can be shattered for Heat-Tempered Plate shards.
  - A roaming Vent-Tender mini-boss guards slag-crusted chests that can drop Steamcore Seals for crafting heat-resistant grips.
- Points of Interest: Steamwatcher Obelisk puzzle; vent-gasket crafting station for engineering rigs.

## Glassbloom Run Terraces
- Layout: Crystal-lined switchbacks under waterfall veils.
- Hooks:
  - Quartzite Bloom clusters spawn alongside cascading water that inflicts a slowing chill if not warded.
  - Veilbound Sentinels set prism traps that refract into searing beams when stepped on, but can be harvested for Prismatic Lens Shards.
  - Shatterbelly Colossus splinters drop Star-etched Glass used in precision sighting recipes.
- Points of Interest: Shatterbelly Colossus boss arena; caravan salvage caches.

## Morrowpine Tangle Groves
- Layout: Tangled pines and rope bridges, dense with spores and aerial roots.
- Hooks:
  - Morrow Root and Thorn Resin nodes nest near fungal choke points; spores apply stacking weakness until fires are lit.
  - Canopy nests contain Feathered Skins and draw in Tangle Wardens that leap between rope bridges to knock players off.
  - Hollowheart roosts occasionally drop Living Briar Grafts, granting armor infusions when crafted.
- Points of Interest: Hollowheart roost event; suspended cooking fires used for training recipes.

## Veilreef Cavern Pools
- Layout: Partially submerged caverns with bioluminescent pools and kelp forests.
- Hooks:
  - Glow Kelp filaments can be gathered but attract Veil Eels that electrify nearby water unless stunned.
  - Pearl clusters rest in tidal alcoves guarded by Glowbrood Matriarch broodlings that drop Iridescent Carapace Fragments.
  - Rune tablets along submerged walls release air pockets and sometimes reveal Tidewrought Rings from collapsed statues.
- Points of Interest: Tide-locked alcoves reveal at low tide; alchemy alembic built into a fallen statue.

## Starfall Orchard Shelves
- Layout: Tiered orchards struck by meteor glass, mixing fruit trees with crystalline craters.
- Hooks:
  - Starfruit clusters spawn near meteor glass craters that periodically burst into starlight shockwaves.
  - Orchard Worg packs hunt by scent; defeating alphas yields Meteorbit Fangs used in agility jewelry.
  - Meteor shard caches can be mined for Emberfallen Slivers that boost enchanting sigils.
- Points of Interest: Fallen comet husk as mini-boss; cider presses doubling as cooking stations.

## Umberdeep Quarry Galleries
- Layout: Abandoned quarry shafts with ore veins and lantern winches.
- Hooks:
  - Umber Pebble seams sparkle near unstable supports; mining without bracing triggers cave-in hazards.
  - Quarry Brutes slam pillars to drop lanterns; shattered lanterns spill Resinous Oil used in explosive charges.
  - Shale Shard carts occasionally carry Smuggler's Satchels with Umbersteel Pins for high-end blacksmithing grinds.
- Points of Interest: Collapsible scaffolds for ambushes; hidden cart tunnels to smugglers' stash vendor.

## Frostborne Steppe Totems
- Layout: Wind-scoured plains dotted with frozen totems and ice fissures.
- Hooks:
  - Frostbite Thistle nodes cluster at the base of frozen totems but spawn freezing gusts unless totems are warmed.
  - Rime Stalkers drag prey toward fissures; slaying them yields Rimeglass Spurs for cold-resistant boots.
  - Frostbound Wardens channel blizzards when totems are struck, dropping Totem Sigil Plates used in rune socketing.
- Points of Interest: Ice-locked relic caches thaw with campfires; leatherworking racks tied to hunt challenges.

## Gloamhollow Fissure Rifts
- Layout: Jagged ravines with glowmoss bridges and unstable stone plates.
- Hooks:
  - Sable Dust nodes are exposed by fissure gusts; harvesting without anchoring causes slide damage.
  - Gloam Terrors burst from shadow pockets when glowmoss bridges are crossed, dropping Rift-etched Sigils.
  - Roaming Writ-Bound Shades attempt to steal gathered dust; defeating them awards Night-inked Scrolls for bounty starts.
- Points of Interest: Echoing chimes grant buffs when rung in sequence; hidden writs start bounty chains.
