# Glimmerdeep_Mire

**Origin/Provenance:** Accounts from Marrowhook lantern barges that drifted into sinkholes and returned with phosphor scars.

**Cultural Tie:** Mirefolk whisper of “gleam debt,” blaming barges for stirring old lights; Saltmarrow fishers trade glowspore lantern oil with unease.

**Gameplay Hook:** Mid-20s to 30s swamp stretch with toxic pools, rope bridges, and phosphor bloom harvesting; feeds crafting reagents and dungeon prep.

**Overview:** Glimmerdeep Mire is a drowned peat basin where fungal lights pulse under fog. Ropeways sway between rotten pylons. Sludge leeches guard hot vents while cult divers seek ash vents rumored to connect to Ashen Cry Grotto.

**Travel & Hazards:**
- Poisoned shallows stack “Mire Slowness.”
- Lantern poles can be lit to clear fog patches for temporary safe passage.
- Occasional “Gleam Surges” spawn luminous predators and rare reagents.

**Slang & Voice:**
- “Pay the gleam” = offer a glowspore to cross safely.
- “Pole-walkers” for ropeway guides.
- “Drowned ash” for cultists hunting vents.
