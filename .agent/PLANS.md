# Season 1 Expansion Plan

## Scope Snapshot
- Zones: build two new regions (Frostbriar Reach, Glimmerdeep Mire) with overviews, subareas, settlements, and repeatable world events.
- Dungeon: add Ashen Cry Grotto (5-man) with overview, bosses, loot tables, and dungeon quest file.
- Quests: seed at least 4 quest hubs (2 per new zone) plus 1 dungeon questline; begin two multi-quest chains; add a handful of repeatables to start.
- Items/Professions: deliver a starter wave (~30 items, ~10 recipes) tied to new zones and dungeon tables; log outstanding volume for later packs.
- Creatures/NPCs: introduce frontier wildlife, mire aberrations, and dungeon cult foes; add a few named NPCs for hubs and vendors.
- Artifacts: create rumor slips, ledgers, bounty posts tied to new quests/items; expand later with additional packs.
- Indexing: update MASTER_NAV plus Regions, Quests, Items, Artifacts indexes; log unresolved scale targets in Lore_Debt.md.

## File Targets
- Regions: `02_Regions/Frostbriar_Reach/` (Zone_Overview, Subareas_and_POIs, Settlements, World_Event, Zone_Index); `02_Regions/Glimmerdeep_Mire/` (same set).
- Dungeon: `06_Systems/Dungeons/Ashen_Cry_Grotto/` (Dungeon_Overview.md, Bosses.md, Loot_Tables.md) and `07_Quests/Dungeon/Ashen_Cry_Grotto_Quests.md`.
- Quests: `07_Quests/Frostbriar_Trail_Hub.md`, `07_Quests/Glimmerdeep_Shore_Hub.md`, `07_Quests/Old_Road_Circuit.md` (existing zone loop), `07_Quests/Mire_Salvage_Chain.md`.
- Items: new files under `08_Items/Fishing/`, `08_Items/Cooking/`, `08_Items/Crafting/`, `08_Items/Gear/`, `08_Items/Trinkets/`, and `08_Items/Keys/` for dungeon hooks.
- Creatures: `03_Lore/Creatures/` entries for Frostbriar elk, mire leeches, ashbound cultists.
- NPCs: start `03_Lore/NPCs/` for new hub leads and vendors.
- Artifacts: `09_Artifacts/` rumor slips, ledgers, bounty cards tied to quests and items.
- Indexes: `00_MASTER_INDEX/MASTER_NAV.md`, and sub-indexes: Regions_Index.md, Quests_Index.md, Items_Index.md, Artifacts_Index.md; note any gaps in Lore_Debt.md.

## Link Targets
- Connect new regions to existing Saltmarrow Strand trade routes and Cinderfen caravans.
- Dungeon hooks draw from Glimmerdeep Mire corruption and Frostbriar missing caravans.
- Items/recipes sourced from Frostbriar vendors, Glimmerdeep creatures, and Ashen Cry boss drops.
- Artifacts hint at routes between new hubs, dungeon entrances, and existing factions (Windbreak watch, Marrowhook traders).

## Volume Tracking (initial wave vs. remaining debt)
- Target now: ~30 items, ~10 recipes, ~4 hubs with ~6-8 quests each, ~10 artifacts, ~6 creatures, ~6 NPCs.
- Remaining to reach Season 1 directives (log in Lore_Debt.md): additional hubs, quests, items (600+), recipes (200+), creatures, NPCs, and artifacts.
