# Expansion Wave Plan

## Scope Overview
- Regions: create 1 new zone (Saltmarrow Strand) with overview, 3-5 sub-areas, travel hazards, slang; add 2 settlements; 1 repeatable local activity. Deepen 2 existing zones with daily-life details.
- Quests: establish 3 quest hubs (new zone + 2 existing zones) with 10-14 quests each; include 2 multi-step chains; at least 6 repeatables.
- Items/Professions: add large batch of themed gear, tools, baits, foods, reagents, junk curios; target 200 items and 90 recipes centered on fishing/cooking/crafting loops.
- Creatures/NPCs: add new creature set and NPC cast tied to zones and quests.
- Artifacts: add supporting rumors, ledgers, bounties connecting to new content.
- Indexing: update 00_MASTER_INDEX/MASTER_NAV.md and relevant sub-indexes; log any gaps in Lore_Debt.md.

## File/Folder Targets
- Regions: `02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/` (new files), updates to two existing region folders for daily-life notes.
- Quests: `07_Quests/` new hub files; cross-link to regions and items.
- Items/Professions: `08_Items/` new catalogs and recipe lists; ensure placement by type.
- Creatures: `03_Lore/Creatures/` new entries within existing structure.
- NPCs: `03_Lore/NPCs/` new profiles.
- Artifacts: `09_Artifacts/` new rumor/ledger bundles tied to items and quests.
- Indexes: `00_MASTER_INDEX/MASTER_NAV.md`, `00_MASTER_INDEX/Lore_Debt.md`, item and region indexes as needed.

## Cross-Link Targets
- Tie fishing and cooking loops to Saltmarrow Strand coast, Cinderfen, and Morrowpine.
- Quest hubs anchored in Saltmarrow Strand fishing town, Cinderfen hot springs, and Greatwood Lodge.
- Items reference new creatures (reefbacks, salt gnats) and NPC vendors (dock quartermasters, hot-spring stewards).
- Artifacts to point toward bounties, recipe scraps, shipping ledgers referencing new items.
