# Cant Marks — Toothed Coin & Siltwake Wheel

*A torn sheet copied by hand. Half field-guide, half warning.
Smells faintly of lamp oil. Corners stained with ditch water.
One edge is scorched as if held too close to a flame that leaned toward it.*

**Compiled by:** “Nails” (no second name offered)  
**Circulated:** among carriers, fences, and people who pretend they’re neither  
**Region:** East Fen Road / Marshline Way / Harrow Field outskirts  
**Date:** Late Harvest, “when the mist learned new tricks”

## WHAT THIS IS (IF YOU’RE NEW, YOU’RE LATE)
Cant marks are not art. They’re not prayers. They’re not children’s doodles.

They’re **instructions** written where the honest don’t look.

A cant mark is usually made with:
- chalk (fast, washes easy)
- soot (cheap, smears)
- tar (stays, tells a story)
- knife notch (permanent, for grudges)
- wax press (rare, for people who want it to look official)

If you see a mark you don’t recognize:  
**don’t stand there thinking about it.** That’s how you get counted.

## THE TWO MARKS THAT KEEP SHOWING UP

### 1) THE TOOTHED COIN
A circle with little bites around the edge. Sometimes just half a circle, like a grin.

**Seen as:**
- chalk ring with notches (quick)
- pressed wax circle with ridges (quiet, “official-looking”)
- a bottle-cap nailed to wood (loud, arrogant)

**Meaning (common):**
“**Someone here pays. Someone here collects.**”

**Meaning (better):**
“**This is a *controlled* route.** You’re not traveling, you’re trespassing.”

**Meaning (best, if you live long enough):**
“**Light is being traded.** Not oil. Not wick. *Light.*”

> If you think that’s nonsense, you’ve never watched a flame lean like a dog hearing its name.

### 2) THE SILTWAKE WHEEL
Three wavy lines under a simple wagon wheel.

**Seen as:**
- charcoal wheel under a ditch plank
- knife notch “wheel” carved into mile-stones
- tar smear near culverts (hard to wash away)

**Meaning (common):**
“**Carrier route — Siltwake Cartage runs this stretch.**”

**Meaning (real):**
“**Siltwake owns this ditch-line tonight.**  
If you’re not paying them, you’re paying someone else.”

**Meaning (danger):**
If you see the Wheel **paired with the Toothed Coin**, it means:
“**Do not stop here unless you’re invited.**  
Stopping means inspection. Inspection means subtraction.”

## PAIRINGS & MODIFIERS (THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE DIE)

Cant works like language: the mark matters, but the *extra scratch* matters more.

### TOOTHED COIN + ONE VERTICAL SLASH ( | )
**“Payment required.”**  
Not a toll. Not a fee. A test.

If you’re offered payment in **buttons**, refuse.  
Buttons are for tracking fools and buying silence from the desperate.

### TOOTHED COIN + TWO SLASHES ( || )
**“Payment already made.”**  
Means a handler is expected. If you show up and nobody greets you, you’re early—or bait.

### TOOTHED COIN + DOT INSIDE ( • )
**“Safe drop.”**  
Safe for the sender. Not necessarily safe for you.

Look for a second mark nearby: if there isn’t one, the “safe” part is a lie.

### TOOTHED COIN + DOT OUTSIDE ( • ) (placed just outside the ring)
**“Watcher present.”**  
Not always the watch. Sometimes worse.

### SILTWAKE WHEEL + ARROW
**“Route shifted.”**  
Usually because the road is watched, washed out, or hungry.

If the arrow points **toward** a mile-stone, someone wants you to look there.
If it points **away** from a mile-stone, someone wants you to avoid it.
If it points **at** the ditch, someone wants you in the ditch. Decide if you deserve it.

### SILTWAKE WHEEL + SMALL TRIANGLE
**“Unload here.”**  
Triangular mark means **short carry**. Expect the buyer to be close, and the excuse to be thin.

### SILTWAKE WHEEL + THREE SHORT TICKS (like a rake)
**“Inspection line.”**  
Means they’re checking stamps, seals, and who you talked to.

If your cargo includes “old stock,” don’t argue. Arguing is how you get volunteered for questions.

---

## THE “GREEN MARK” WARNING (YES, AGAIN)
If you see **anything** in green ink that looks like an official stamp:
- Council sheaf-mark
- trade office scribble
- permit initialing

…assume it’s either forged or written by a clerk who wants you indebted.

Green is the color of:
- cheap dye
- sick flame
- and favors you will repay.

---

## WHERE THESE MARKS SHOW UP (SO YOU CAN PRETEND YOU DIDN’T SEE THEM)

### Places you’ll find the Toothed Coin:
- underside of signboards (taverns, cartage offices)
- inside well housings (where sound carries)
- on the back of “public notices” (posted by people who read them too closely)
- pressed in wax on receipts that were “ripped by accident”

### Places you’ll find the Siltwake Wheel:
- culvert mouths (inside, not outside)
- ditch-crossing planks
- mile-stones (third marker is a favorite, because everyone talks about it)
- wagon-yard posts behind markets

If you find **both** marks near a council shed, stop smiling.  
Someone is using law like a mask.
