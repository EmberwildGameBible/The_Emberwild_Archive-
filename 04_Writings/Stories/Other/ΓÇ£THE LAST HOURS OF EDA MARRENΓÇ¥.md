# “THE LAST HOURS OF EDA MARREN”

(A personal account written in the margin of a half-finished weaving pattern. The ink bleeds in places, as if written in haste, or with hands that would not stop shaking.)

Hour Before Sunset

I was meant to finish Neera’s shawl today. She asked for the sky-blue thread, the one her mother saved for special feast days. I told her I’d have it done by winter’s turn.

I don’t think I’ll see winter.

Something’s wrong with the house. Not the beams, not the stones—the shape of it. The corners feel too sharp now. As if the room has one angle more than yesterday, though that’s foolish. Houses don’t grow new corners.

But when I sweep, the dust piles in places that didn’t exist last week.

The dog refuses to enter the back room. His hackles rise even when I carry him close.

I should have left this morning, but the loom was still threaded and I thought: one more row, then I’ll go. But the rows kept coming. And the light kept thinning. And the house kept listening.

After Nightfall

Someone walked past the window.

No footfalls. No lantern. Just a shape drifting slow, like a figure underwater.

I called out.

It stopped.

Turned its head toward me.

I shut the curtains so fast I tore them from the rod.

The dog hid beneath the table. He hasn’t barked once. Won’t look at the walls.

There’s a knocking somewhere inside the house, but it’s not at the door. It comes from the beams. Or under the floorboards. Or from the walls themselves. Like the house is tapping its own frame to test where it’s weakest.

Near Midnight

The weaving rod snapped on its own. I wasn’t touching it.

Neera’s shawl fell across the floor—threads pulled loose in long trails, weaving undone in the same way cloth unravels when something inside wants out.

My hands shake but I still write because the silence is worse. The house has gone still. Not peaceful—expectant. Like it’s listening for me to breathe.

The dog is staring at the ceiling. His tail is tucked so tight I fear he’ll break his spine. I whispered his name. He growled, but not at me.

At the rafters.

At the dark between them.

I won’t look.

If I look, it will look back.

Moments Before the End

It’s in the hallway now.

Not walking.

Not dragging.

Just pressing, as if something immense is leaning its weight against the walls without using limbs.

The wood bows inward.

The nails sing.

The air is too thin to swallow.

I hear my name being spoken, but with the wrong mouth. Too wide. Too wet. Like someone learned the shape of speech but not the way breath fits inside it.

The candles go long and narrow, their flames pulled toward the back room—the one the dog wouldn’t enter. The shadows bend that way too.

I think it wants me to follow.

I will not follow.

I put this account here so someone might know why the house stands empty tomorrow. Why the door is open but the rooms are wrong. Why the walls bow inward like the ribs of a creature exhaling its last.

If you enter—if you must enter—

Do not speak your name inside.

Do not stand with your back to a corner that wasn’t there yesterday.

And if something in the rafters shifts in answer to your breath,

Run.
