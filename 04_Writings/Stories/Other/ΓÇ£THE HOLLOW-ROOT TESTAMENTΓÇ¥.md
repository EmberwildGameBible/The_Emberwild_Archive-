# “THE HOLLOW-ROOT TESTAMENT”

(A loose sheet of bark-paper, edges gnawed by insects. The script is slow, shaky—written by someone who took great care, or great effort, with every stroke.)

To the one who walks after me,

If you have found this page tucked within the hollow root, then you’ve come farther into this wood than I ever meant anyone to go. I did not hide it to keep secrets—I hid it because speaking plainly would shame my sons, and their sons.

But the truth’s a stubborn thing. It rots if you bury it.

So here is mine.

—

I was a coward.

Not the kind who flees a blade—no. I felled trees for thirty years with men who swung harder than I ever dared. I took splinters long as fingers out of my own palm without making a sound. I raised two boys on winters thin as hunger. A man may do all that and still be a coward.

A coward is one who looks away when the land asks him to answer.

The land asked me once.

I turned.

It was eight summers ago, long before the forest began leaning with this strange new purpose. I was felling oak for the ridge lodges. The trees up there grow quiet—their rings tight, their shadows colder than they ought to be. But they’re good timber. Straight. Strong.

I remember the morning because of the birds. There were none. Not even the little gray chitterers that swarm the brush lines. Just wind.

I swung the axe into the first oak. Fine cut. Clean. But when the trunk groaned, something inside the wood groaned with it. Not sap. Not storm rot.

Something living.

I stepped back. I listened.

There came a tapping from within the tree. Slow. Even. Too even for any beast I know. A rhythm like a man knocking from inside a coffin.

I should’ve called the others. Should’ve marked the place and gone back to the lodge.

Instead I swung again.

The tapping stopped.

When the oak fell, the trunk split in a way I’ve never seen—hollow through the heart, though the wood around it was sound. Smooth inside. Polished. As if shaped by tools older than any hand.

The air that came out of that hollow was warm, like breath.

I sealed the hollow and told no one.

—

That was my cowardice.

Not the fear. The silence.

The forest changed after that season. The lean of the trees began almost one by one. Then whole groves. My sons asked me why the elders met so often, why men whispered about the ridge and the strange warmth in the soil.

I told them nothing.

I thought that by keeping quiet I’d keep them safe.

Now I know better: what the forest suffers, it suffers around us, with or without our knowing.

—

If the hollow still breathes—which I pray it does not—do not open it anew.

Mark the place. Call the Wardens. Or burn the stump clean and salt the earth. I do not know what waits inside such a tree, nor what it asks of the men who hear it.

But I know this:

When the land knocks, it means to be answered.

And if you turn away long enough, it will knock again, louder.

Forgive these shaking lines. I am old, and the ridge grows stranger with each passing thaw.

If my sons find this, let them know I kept silent not from shame of them, but from shame of myself.
