# WORKER’S CONFESSION — “Collapse Was My Fault”

*Left in a locker at a mining camp.*

It was my fault.

Beam cracked yesterday.

I saw it, didn’t report it. Thought it would hold another shift.

When it came down today, I knew right away what I’d done.

Merrin’s gone because of me.

Won’t tell the guild.

Won’t tell the crew.

But I’m writing it here so I don’t forget.

Even if nobody reads it.
