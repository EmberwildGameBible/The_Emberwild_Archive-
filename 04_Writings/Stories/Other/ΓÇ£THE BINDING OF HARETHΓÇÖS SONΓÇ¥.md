# “THE BINDING OF HARETH’S SON”

A forester’s tale set down by hand in a stitched bark-cover booklet. The ink has bled in places; some words strike through and are rewritten, as though the teller could not bear to leave the memory plain.

—

We do not speak this story to frighten our young.

We speak it so they know the price of pride.

It was told to me by my own teacher, and to him by his father before, and perhaps the telling helps the dead stay where they belong.

If only Hareth’s son had kept to listening instead of wandering.

In the days when the lodge still had a roof of pine shingles and not this patchwork of sod and tar, there lived a hunter named Hareth Broad-Shoulder.

A fair man.

Quiet, steady, slow to speak his mind but fiercer than a cornered boar when roused.

His wife died birthing their only child, Eran.

The boy was all his mother’s softness and all his father’s stubbornness, and loved the woods more than the hearth.

Too much more.

He would follow animal prints for miles, ignoring Hareth’s calls, ignoring meals, ignoring the evening bell.

“It is not enough to track what you see,” Hareth told him.

“You must heed what sees you.”

The boy only smiled.

Youth often mistakes love for worry.

The trouble began on the Last-Summer Feast when the lodge fires burned low and drink made boastful men out of quiet ones.

Someone told Eran of the Deep Stag—that pale creature seen only at dusk, its antlers black as river mud, its hide white as morning frost.

Some say it is an omen.

Some say a promise.

Some say if you glimpse it full-on, your fate binds to another’s.

Children repeat these things.

Men usually forget them.

But Eran was neither child nor man—stuck in that dangerous middle where a heart is too brave and a skull too hard.

He crept out after the feast, taking only a bone-handled knife and his father’s old cloak.

He did not leave a note.

He did not mean harm.

But harm seldom waits to be meant.

Hareth rose at dawn to find the boy gone and the cloak missing.

He felt a chill in his bones that the sun could not warm.

He followed Eran’s tracks—light, excited, quick-stepping—eastward through the pine-lanes, across the dew-wet meadow, and into the shadow of the old elms.

There he found the first sign something was wrong.

The grass was pressed flat in a strange curve—not a stride of man nor beast he knew.

Three wide depressions, like great hooves.

But hooves do not move in a pattern like that.

They do not pivot in a circle as though something had turned without lifting its weight.

Hareth touched the print and felt cold travel up his arm.

He did not call Eran’s name.

Not now.

Not here.

He followed the path toward the river.

By noon he found the boy’s knife.

It lay atop a stump, its tip stained a faint color—not blood, nor sap, but something pale and thin like the milk of crushed roots.

Around it were marks in the bark—light scratches, as if something with narrow tines had tested the wood.

The air smelled strange.

Thin.

Like the breath after a long cry.

Hareth’s fear hardened then.

A father knows when his child has wandered into something older than the lodge’s teachings.

He pressed on.

He found Eran at dusk.

The boy stood knee-deep in the river water, unmoving, staring across to the opposite bank.

Hareth called out, softly at first, then louder, but Eran did not stir.

The river was quiet.

Too quiet.

When Hareth reached him, he saw the boy’s eyes were glassy, reflecting something in the woods beyond.

Hareth followed his gaze.

And there, not twenty paces off, half-hidden behind a leaning willow, stood a shape too tall for a stag, too thin for a man, its antlers dipping low as though burdened.

Its hide was the pale of fog.

Its breath did not steam in the cold air.

And though it had no eyes that Hareth could see, he felt its attention like a hand laid on his throat.

Hareth did not draw his blade.

He did not shout.

He simply placed a hand on his boy’s shoulder and whispered:

“Turn away.”

It took three tries before Eran blinked.

When he finally looked at his father, he whispered,

“Pa… it asked me to follow.”

The shape stepped once toward the water.

The river rippled against the current.

Hareth pulled the boy back, inch by inch, never breaking his stare.

He did not run; running invites chase.

He did not bow; bowing invites claim.

Only when the willow bent—leaning not from wind, but toward that pale shape—did Hareth gather Eran into his arms and retreat.

The shape did not pursue.

But it watched long after they vanished into the tree line.

Eran woke in the lodge three days later.

His first words were not of fear but shame.

He said the thing had spoken without speaking—

that it had shown him paths no deer walked,

and places no hunter mapped,

and he had felt special, chosen, seen.

Hareth cupped the boy’s face and said:

“Being seen by the wrong thing is not a gift.”

He never raised his voice.

Never spoke of the pale shape again.

But from that day forward, Hareth never let the boy walk the woods without him.

And from that day forward, the willow by the river leaned just so—

as if still waiting for someone too young to know better.

—

That is the binding.

That is the price.

A thing older than men marked a boy,

and a father broke the mark through love rather than blade.

Some say the pale shape still wanders the riverbank.

Some say it seeks what it almost claimed.

I only know this:

If you hear your name spoken from across the water—

do not answer.

Let the current take the sound.

And walk home by another path.

End of tale.
