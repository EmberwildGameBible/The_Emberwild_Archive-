# A COIN FOR A CHILD

---

A Collection of Bedside Words, Gathered from Many Homes Across Emberwild

Compiled at the Lodge of Broadwater by Keeper Rellin after the Long Winter

(The book is small, the cover cracked at the spine. Many hands have written inside — some neat, some clumsy, some written in charcoal, some in ink that has cracked brown with age.)

## 1. The Reedmother’s Verse

(Swamper origin — found on a scrap of cloth tucked between pages)

“Hush now, little one,

the reeds lean low,

for night-tide listens

where the still waters go.

Keep your breath gentle,

keep your heart mild,

for the world bends softer

around a quiet child.”

My mother sang this when storms rattled the slats.

I do the same.

—M.

## 2. A Highland Father’s Rule

(Written with a heavy, sure hand — likely a stoneworker)

If you fear the dark, sit with it awhile.

If the dark fears you, leave at once.

That is all I ever told my boy.

He grew wise enough off that single lesson.

—Harrun of the Northlift

## 3. A Plainsfolk Counting Rhyme

(A child’s handwriting, backwards letters, cute mistakes)

“One hoof, two hoof,

three in the grass.

If four hoof sound,

you run fast fast.”

Below it, in an adult’s hand:

She wouldn’t sleep unless I sang it.

Even now, I catch myself whispering it on old trails.

—Talla

## 4. From the Hearth of Elder Simm

(Written with old scholar’s steadiness — thin ink, careful script)

Children must learn early:

The world is not cruel, but indifferent.

Our task is to be kind enough that the world remembers we were here.

Tell them this when they are young,

but whisper it again when they are grown.

It matters more the second time.

## 5. The Duner Vigil Song

(Written like someone trying to remember words long forgotten)

“We keep the fire,

we guard the name,

we hold our children

near the flame.

Sand takes footprints,

wind takes sound —

hold your dear ones,

lest they be found.”

I do not recall the tune.

Only that my mother cried when she sang it.

—Saren

## 6. A Boatman’s Promise

(Quick strokes, ink blobs — a working man’s hand)

Told my boy this every night he dreamed of drowning:

“No river shall have you.

No deep shall keep you.

Your father’s hand finds you

swift as a thrown rope.”

He stopped dreaming it after a year.

I did not.

—Verrin of the Marshline

## 7. A Forester’s Mother Writes

(Soft handwriting, uneven, as though the writer was tired but gentle)

When a child asks why the night makes its own noise,

tell them this:

“That’s the world turning its pages.

We are only on one of them.”

My Anna slept better once she believed the night was reading, not hunting.

## 8. The Broken Poem of Ildra

(A torn corner, stuck into the book and later copied)

“Little ember, little spark,

stay close in the wandering dark.

If the world grows sharp and wild,

stay behind me, quiet child.”

She recited this to her son during the famine.

He survived.

She did not.

We keep her words in her stead.

—Keeper Rellin

## 9. A Father Who Had No Songs Left

(Short, blunt, honest — written after an argument or long night)

I told her,

“There is no song tonight.”

She cried.

So I took the pan off the coals,

sat on the floor beside her,

and said,

“All right then.

We will be tired together.”

She stopped crying.

Sometimes that is enough.

Sometimes that is all a man has.

---

## 10. A Prayer Without a God

(Strange handwriting; someone educated but unsure)

“Keep her steps when mine grow weak.

Keep her laughter when mine has gone thin.

Carry her dreams further than my own feet walked.”

I do not know who I speak to when I whisper this,

but saying it eases the weight.

—Written at the bedside of my daughter, age 2

---

## 11. The Plainsfolk Warning

(Carved-looking strokes — copied from words etched on wood)

If your child wakes saying they heard someone call their name

from outside the tent—

Do not answer.

Do not open the flap.

Hold them.

Face the far wall.

Let the voice pass.

This is not superstition.

This is lived memory.

—Copied by Renn

## 12. The Coin for a Quiet Child

(The namesake entry — written last, in firm, loving script)

When the world grows frightening,

and the night grows tall,

and a child cannot sleep

for fear of losing all—

Place a coin beneath their pillow.

Not for luck,

not for spirits,

not for any charm of old.

It is a promise.

A parent’s promise.

That tomorrow will come.

That supper will be warm.

That someone will be there

to lift them when they fall.

A coin is not much.

But a promise can be enough

to quiet even the loudest fear.

If you give it with a steady hand.
