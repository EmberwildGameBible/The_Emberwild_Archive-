# THE GHOST OF THORNMERE

---

I need to tell you about Korin Greaves before somebody else does and gets it wrong.

Korin wasn’t magic. He was just patient. And mean. And so gods-damned tired that I think part of him was hoping something would finally kill him just so he could rest.

But I’m getting ahead of myself.

---

My name’s Hanna Greyfell. I run Crosswind Lodge, which sits at the junction of three trade roads in Forester territory. Been doing it for eleven years, ever since a great cat took my left leg off below the knee and I decided hunting wasn’t for me anymore.

Running a lodge is fine work if you don’t mind being part innkeeper, part confessor, part medic, and part undertaker. You meet a lot of people. Most of them are decent. Some are liars. A few are idiots who think they’re invincible right up until something with teeth proves otherwise.

And then, very rarely, you meet someone like Korin.

He walked into my lodge on a cold morning three years back. Didn’t say hello. Didn’t ask for a room. Just walked straight to the bounty wall like he’d been thinking about it for miles and didn’t want to waste time now that he’d arrived.

The bounty wall’s my least favorite part of the job.

It’s not that I mind putting up notices—someone’s got to coordinate this stuff. But every piece of paper on that wall represents something that went *wrong*. A creature that stopped being part of the natural order and became a problem. And problems, in my experience, tend to get solved with blood.

That morning the wall had the usual spread: a few minor annoyances, couple of serious threats, and right at the top in red ink, the one that’d been haunting me for three years.

**BROKEN CROWN.**

Korin stood there reading it for maybe two minutes. Didn’t move. Didn’t react. Just read.

I’d learned to watch people when they looked at that particular bounty. You could tell a lot about a hunter by how they responded to it. The young ones got excited—saw the 150 silver reward and started calculating what they’d spend it on. The experienced ones got quiet, read the incident reports, and then usually moved on to something easier.

Korin did neither.

He just pointed at it and said, “This one.”

I was wiping down the bar. Stopped mid-wipe.

“You sure?”

“Yes.”

“You know it’s been up for three years? Forty-two attempts, four dead, and some of the best hunters in three territories have tried and failed?”

“I read the reports.”

Something about the way he said it made me look at him properly for the first time. He was maybe late forties, maybe older—hard to tell with people who spend most of their life outdoors. Weathered face, the kind where you couldn’t tell if the lines were from sun or worry. Dark hair going gray at the temples. Eyes that didn’t really look *at* you so much as through you, like he was already seeing something else.

His gear was old but maintained with the kind of care that told you it was the only gear he had. The bow across his back had been re-strung at least twice. His boots were worn smooth at the heels.

He looked like every other broke hunter who came through, except for one thing: he wasn’t nervous. Wasn’t excited. Wasn’t *anything*.

Just calm.

The kind of calm you get from being so tired that fear doesn’t have anywhere to grab hold anymore.

“Alright,” I said. “I need a name for the ledger.”

He made a mark instead. Just a slash and a curve, like he’d done it a thousand times.

“That’s not a name.”

“It’s what you’re getting.”

I should’ve pushed. Should’ve insisted. But something told me this man would walk out the door and I’d never see him or my 150 silver bounty again, so I let it go.

He left without another word.

Torven—one of my regulars, good hunter, better drinker—watched him go and said, “That man’s either going to solve your problem or become another incident report.”

I didn’t disagree.

---

Eight days later, Korin walked back in.

It was dusk. Common room was half-full—couple of trappers playing dice, merchant eating stew, young Forester couple on their way to visit family up north.

Korin dragged something wrapped in canvas across the floor. The scraping sound made everyone stop and look.

He unwrapped it.

The broken antlers lay there on my floor like some kind of profane offering. They were bigger than I’d imagined—thick as my wrist at the base, jagged break points worn smooth with age. You could see where Broken Crown had used them, too. Deep scores in the bone where he’d gored something, probably multiple somethings.

The common room went dead silent.

I walked over. Knelt down—awkward with the wooden leg, but I managed. Picked up one of the antlers. Turned it over. Checked the coloration, the wear patterns, the distinctive asymmetry that every report had mentioned.

“It’s him,” I said.

Felt strange saying it out loud. Broken Crown had been on my wall so long I’d half-started thinking of him as permanent. Like a landmark. Like something that would outlast all of us out of pure spite.

Torven recovered first. “How’d you do it?”

Korin shrugged. “Tracked him. Waited. Shot him.”

“That’s it?”

“That’s it.”

One of the trappers—kid named Jess, maybe twenty, too much confidence for his own good—laughed. “Come on. Nobody tracks Broken Crown for eight days and just *shoots* him. Jorren Blackwood put three arrows in him and nearly died. The Ridgefall party hit him six times and he still walked away. What’d you do different?”

Korin looked at him. Really looked at him. And I saw something flicker across his face—not anger exactly, more like exhaustion at having to explain something obvious.

“I didn’t do anything different,” he said. “I just waited longer.”

“How much longer?”

“As long as it took.”

He collected his silver—counted it out carefully, which told me he needed every piece—and turned to leave.

I stopped him. “Wait. I need a name.”

“No, you don’t.”

“People are going to want to know who killed Broken Crown.”

He paused at the door. Didn’t turn around.

“Let them wonder,” he said.

And he left.

---

Three hunters went to verify the kill the next morning. Took them half a day to find the body—Korin hadn’t told us exactly where he’d left it, probably figured we’d manage.

They found Broken Crown near the old mill ruins, which tracked with the reports of his usual territory. Single arrow through the heart, angled up through the chest cavity. Perfect placement. The kind of shot you make when you know exactly where every vital organ sits and you’ve got all the time in the world to line it up.

But what made them uncomfortable was everything around the kill site.

The grass was crushed flat in a line maybe thirty feet from the body. Someone had lain there for a long time—long enough to leave a definite impression. Near that was a cleared shooting lane, brush carefully moved aside to leave an unobstructed view. You could see where someone had tested their draw, marked distances, calculated wind.

And the tracks—gods, the tracks.

Korin’s boots were everywhere. Circles around the area, back and forth, covering every approach. He’d mapped the entire clearing. Learned where Broken Crown walked, where he stopped, where he felt safe.

Kael—youngest of the three, sharp kid, notices things—knelt down and traced one of the boot prints with his finger.

“He was here for *days*,” Kael said. “Look at this. Same spot, multiple impressions, different depths. He came back to the same position over and over. Was he… was he waiting for the stag to develop a *routine*?”

The older hunter, man named Bren who’d been tracking for twenty years, nodded slowly.

“That’s exactly what he did,” Bren said. “He didn’t hunt Broken Crown. He *studied* him. Figured out his patterns. Found the one spot where the stag stopped long enough for a guaranteed kill shot. And then he waited—could’ve been days, could’ve been a week—until Broken Crown came back to that exact spot.”

“That’s not hunting,” Jess said.

“No,” Bren agreed. “That’s something else. That’s…” He struggled for the word. “That’s *inevitability*. He didn’t give Broken Crown a chance. Didn’t give him a fight. Just waited until the universe aligned and then ended it.”

They brought back their report and I added it to my records. Didn’t share all the details with the common room—people were already making up stories, didn’t need to feed that fire.

But I thought about it. Thought about it a lot.

Most hunters I knew had some fire in them. Some drive. They wanted the glory or the silver or the proof that they could do it. Even the quiet ones, the professional ones, they had *something* pushing them forward.

Korin hadn’t looked like that. He’d looked like a man doing a job he didn’t particularly want to do but knew nobody else would do properly.

Like he was solving a problem not because he wanted to, but because leaving it unsolved would bother him more than the effort of fixing it.

---

Two months later, I heard about Pale Fang.

Staghelm Lodge, two territories north. Priority bounty, 120 silver. Albino wolf leading a pack, too smart for his own good, racking up livestock kills and making hunting parties look stupid.

Bounty’d been up four months. Eleven attempts, eleven failures.

Then it got collected.

I didn’t hear the details directly—lodge-keepers gossip worse than washerwomen, but information takes time to travel. What I got was secondhand through a trader who’d stopped at Staghelm: quiet man, old bow, didn’t give a name, killed the wolf in seven days, took the silver, left.

I asked what the man looked like.

The description matched.

Over the next year, the pattern repeated. Difficult bounties getting solved. Always the same story: quiet man, no name, disappears for days, comes back with proof.

The lodge-keepers started comparing notes. Started keeping descriptions. Same height, same build, same worn gear.

Same tired eyes.

We didn’t have a name—he wouldn’t give one—but the stories started circulating anyway. People called him “The Silent” or “Ghost” or “One-Shot,” though none of the names stuck because nobody was sure if they were even talking about the same person.

I knew, though.

I’d seen his eyes.

You don’t forget eyes like that.

The bounty that changed everything went up six weeks ago.

I posted it myself, and I hated every word.

**OLD IRON.**

Bear. Patriarch-class. Estimated fifteen years old. Eight hundred pounds of scar tissue and bad attitude. Had killed three hunters, destroyed two lodges, and claimed the entire Blackridge Pass as his exclusive territory.

I didn’t want to post it. Old Iron wasn’t a *problem*—he was a landmark. The kind of creature you respected. The kind you told your grandchildren about. The kind that had earned his territory through sheer refusal to die.

But people kept trying to kill him. Young hunters, stupid hunters, hunters who’d heard the stories and thought they’d be the one to do it.

And Old Iron kept killing them.

So I posted the bounty with a reward that made my coin purse weep—250 silver—and a warning that took up half the page. I made it as clear as I could: *this is not a hunt, this is a war, do not attempt this, we’re only posting it so you know to STAY AWAY.*

Nobody took it.

Not Torven. Not Merra. Not even the big hunting parties who usually loved a challenge.

Because Old Iron wasn’t just dangerous. He was a gods-damned legend. And you don’t kill legends. You just… don’t.

Three days ago, Korin walked in.

I recognized him immediately. He looked worse than last time—thinner, more weathered, like he’d been on the road too long without proper rest.

He walked to the bounty wall. Studied Old Iron’s notice.

I said, “You’re not thinking about taking that one.”

“I am.”

“That’s not like the others. That bear’s earned that territory. He’s not killing people because he’s aggressive—he’s killing people because they won’t leave him alone.”

“I know.”

“Then *why?*”

He was quiet for a long moment. Stared at the bounty like it was personally offending him.

“Because someone will try eventually,” he said. “Someone young who doesn’t know better. Someone who thinks they can do it because they’ve got a good bow and they’ve heard the stories. And Old Iron will kill them. Badly. And then someone else will try to avenge them. And it’ll keep going until either the bear’s dead or a dozen hunters are.”

He looked at me.

“So I’m going to kill him first. Before it gets worse.”

“That’s a terrible reason to take a bounty.”

“I know.”

He signed the ledger—same mark, no name—and left.

That was three days ago.

---

Tonight the common room’s quieter than usual.

Everyone’s waiting. Nobody’s saying it out loud, but we’re all thinking the same thing: he’s not coming back.

You can’t kill a patriarch. Not alone. Not with an old bow and worn-out boots. Patriarchs are the ones who survive when everything else dies. They’re the end-point of natural selection, the most powerful of their species, the creatures that define what “old and dangerous” means in practical terms.

Torven’s on his fifth drink. Merra’s here too—she came down from her territory just to wait, which tells you something about how seriously people are taking this. Even Jess is quiet, which is a small miracle.

I’m pretending to do inventory. Really I’m watching the door.

The fire’s burning low. Someone should add wood. Nobody moves.

The door opens.

Korin walks in.

He’s limping. There’s blood on his jacket—not fresh, but not old either. His face looks like he hasn’t slept in three days, which he probably hasn’t. The bow across his back has a fresh crack near the grip.

He’s carrying something wrapped in canvas.

The common room doesn’t breathe.

He sets it on the floor. Unwraps it slowly.

A bear skull. Massive. Scarred. You can see where breaks had healed wrong, where teeth had been knocked out and regrown crooked, where bone had calcified over old wounds.

One ear socket shows damage—healed fracture from years ago.

It’s Old Iron. No question.

Korin says, “Confirmed kill. I’ll take the payment.”

I just stare at him.

Then I walk to the lockbox like I’m in a dream, count out 250 silver with shaking hands, and slide it across the bar.

“How?” My voice sounds strange. “That’s a patriarch. You don’t kill a patriarch with—”

“I wounded him,” Korin interrupts. “Arrow through the shoulder. Not lethal but bad enough to slow him. Then I tracked him for three days while he bled. Waited until he was weak. Then I finished it.”

The common room is absolutely silent.

That’s not how you’re supposed to hunt. You don’t wound something and track it until it’s dying. That’s not clean. That’s not honorable. That’s not—

“That’s not a hunt,” Merra says quietly. “That’s an execution.”

Korin looks at her. For the first time since I’ve known him, something flickers across his face. Not anger. Not pride.

Shame.

“I know,” he says. “But he’s dead. And now nobody else has to die trying to kill him.”

He picks up the silver. Turns to leave.

“What’s your name?” I ask.

He stops. Doesn’t turn around.

“Does it matter?”

“Yes.”

Long silence. The fire pops. Someone coughs.

“Greaves,” he says finally. “Korin Greaves. I was a bounty hunter up north for twenty years. Lost my wife and daughter to a winter storm while I was off chasing a contract I didn’t need to take. Came south to get away from the memories. Turns out I’m only good at one thing.”

“Killing,” Torven says. It’s not a question.

“No.” Korin’s voice is quiet. “Solving problems. These creatures—Broken Crown, Pale Fang, Old Iron—they’re not evil. They’re just animals that ended up in the wrong place, doing the wrong things, and someone has to handle it before more people die. Someone who’s not going to make it worse. Someone who’s willing to do it the *wrong* way if the right way doesn’t work.”

He looks back at me.

“That’s all I am now. The one who does it wrong so everyone else can keep doing it right.”

Then he leaves.

The door closes.

Nobody moves for a long time.

---

I updated the bounty wall this morning.

Under Old Iron’s notice, I wrote: *Completed. Korin Greaves.*

Then I added a note at the bottom:

*“If you have a creature that won’t die. If you’ve tried everything. If people are dying and you’re out of options: Korin Greaves. No lodge. No address. No guarantee. But if he shows up, the problem gets solved.”*

It’s been three hours since I posted it.

Two other lodge-keepers have already sent runners asking if I have contact information.

I don’t.

Nobody does.

Korin Greaves is a ghost. He shows up when he wants, solves the problems nobody else can solve, and disappears again into the Emberwild like smoke.

And maybe that’s for the best.

Because the things he does—tracking prey for days until they develop patterns, wounding them and waiting until they’re weak, killing legends that should be left alone—those aren’t the actions of a hero.

They’re the actions of someone who’s already dead inside and just hasn’t stopped moving yet.

Someone who’s solving problems not because he wants glory or silver or respect, but because if he stops working, he’ll have to think about what he lost.

And thinking about it might actually kill him.

So he keeps moving. Keeps solving. Keeps killing things that need killing even when it costs him pieces of his soul he doesn’t have left to spend.

That’s Korin Greaves.

Not a legend. Not a hero.

Just a tired man with an old bow and a job he can’t quit.

And gods help whatever creature gets a bounty posted next, because Korin will show up eventually.

And when he does, the problem ends.

One way or another.
