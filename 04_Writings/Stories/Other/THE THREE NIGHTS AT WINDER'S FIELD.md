# “THE THREE NIGHTS AT WINDER’S FIELD”

(A bound leaf from a torn notebook. Dirt-stained. Written in a firm but inelegant hand, the kind of penmanship a soldier learns late in life.)

Night One

Winder’s Field is quiet again tonight.

Captain says the Plainsfolk only pull back this far when they’re choosing ground for something serious, but he says it calm, the way men do when they’re lying to their own teeth.

I took first watch. Stars were clear until they weren’t—sky went white like someone lit a forge behind the clouds. The light stayed too long to be lightning. Made the grass stand straight. Made the horses restless.

Heard a whistling too. Soft at first. Like a kettle wanting to warn you but not ruin your soup. It came from the north line, but when I walked toward it, my ears said south instead. Damn thing moved like it didn’t want to be pointed at.

Corwin joked it was just the wind.

But the wind doesn’t whistle through still grass.

Night Two

Lost Corwin.

Not dead—gone.

I’ll write this plain so I don’t choke on the truth later.

We were walking perimeter. He had the lantern, I had the spear. He stopped near the old well that’s sunk half-crooked in the earth. Said he heard someone calling. Said he swore it sounded like his sister’s voice—soft and bending in that way she used to talk when they were young.

I told him no one knows we’re out here. No one but command and the Plainsfolk scouts, and they don’t have voices like his kin.

But he kept listening. Lantern held up high.

He said, “Hear it? She’s saying my name.”

The wind died.

Everything died.

Then the lantern went out.

Lost him in the dark.

If he screamed, I didn’t hear it.

If he ran, I couldn’t see him.

Found the lantern in the morning. Glass unbroken. Flame dry. No footprints but his—leading straight to the well.

But none leading away.

Night Three

Captain forbade watches alone, though we’re down a man and discipline’s breaking like old leather.

Stranger came from the north line at dusk. Man-shaped, but the shoulders were wrong. Too narrow. Too high. Like someone built a person from memory but got the joints out of place.

He walked up to the fire slow, polite even.

Said he was a courier bringing word from Vedras.

No courier walks Winder’s Field at night.

No courier wears no boots.

No courier’s shadow moves before he does.

Captain didn’t see it.

Or pretended not to.

The man—or the shape—sat with us. Didn’t eat. Didn’t drink. Just asked questions. Too many. About our numbers. Our routes. Our signal lines. The name of our quartermaster. The horses’ colors. The birthdays of the men nearest him.

When no one answered, he smiled.

His teeth were small. Too many.

Like a child’s drawing of a smile.

When the fire dimmed, he dimmed with it.

Faded like smoke.

Vanished without standing up.

Horses screamed long after.

Final Note

We break camp at dawn. Captain won’t say so, but he’s rattled. He prays under his breath now. Calls for saints I’ve never heard of.

If Corwin’s alive, I hope he kept his spear and not his lantern.

If the courier comes again, I won’t write about it—I’ll run.

If anyone finds this book, burn it after reading. Some things follow ink.
