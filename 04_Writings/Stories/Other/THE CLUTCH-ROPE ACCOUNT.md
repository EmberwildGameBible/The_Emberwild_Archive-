# “THE CLUTCH-ROPE ACCOUNT”

(A folded page torn from a larger ledger, stained with oil and river grit. The handwriting is rough—someone used to marking crates, not penwork.)

To whoever finds this,

I ain’t much for writing, but the foreman keeps saying a man ought to leave his sense somewhere besides his skull. So here it is.

Three days back, down on the river loading the last of the timber, we heard the clutch-rope straining. Not the normal strain—ropes groan all day, that’s their nature. This was a twang like something pulling back, like a bow at full draw.

Timmens thought it was the current. I thought it was ice shifting under. Then the rope snapped.

Didn’t whip. Didn’t fly. It just—dropped.

Dropped straight down into the water like something cut it clean, but the fibers weren’t cut. They were separated. Pulled apart neat as thread teased by fingers.

Timmens said not to speak of it. Said the river plays tricks on men who’ve been too long near winter. But I’ve seen ropes snap plenty. They don’t come apart like cloth.

Second Note (written later, shakier):

Should’ve left that day.

Foreman ordered new rope. We lashed it thrice over the pulley. The crates were still on the dock when the river rose a hand-span in a blink.

Not with rain. Not with melt. The rise came from beneath, like something big passed under the water.

Then the rope went tight.

Not pulled by any crate—those were still on land. It tightened as if hauling something down there. Timmens grabbed my arm and said not to pull. I think he meant it for both of us, but the rope was already screaming.

And then it let go again. Same as before. Fibers parted. Clean.

The river settled like nothing had happened.

But I swear I saw eyes below. Not glowing. Not beast-bright. Just… watching.

Final Note (penned in uneven bends, as if written while moving):

I quit this crew. Foreman can dock my pay, I don’t care. There’s something beneath the bend that knows the feel of rope. Something that tests it same way wolves test fences.

Last night I heard dragging across the shallows. Slow. Patient.

I won’t be near when it learns the weight of men.

If someone reads this—don’t moor boats on the south bank after sundown.

And if the clutch-rope goes tight when nothing’s tied to it,

leave it.

Let the river keep what the river calls for.
