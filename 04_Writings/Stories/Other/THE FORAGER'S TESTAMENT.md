## ON ACRELEAF AND THE FIRST LESSONS

You’ll find acreleaf everywhere. That’s the point.

When my daughter turned eight summers, I took her to the eastern meadows where the grass grows tall enough to hide a crouching child. I knelt beside her in the green sea and showed her the soft, faintly sweet leaves that every Forester learns first.

“This,” I told her, “is what keeps you alive when everything else goes wrong.”

She looked disappointed. She’d wanted me to show her ashspore cap, or blackbark truffle—the rare things, the valuable things. The herbs that sell for silver in the lodges.

“Papa,” she said, “everyone knows acreleaf.”

“Yes,” I said. “And everyone who survives past their first winter knows *why*.”

Acreleaf grows where people can reach it. It asks nothing of you—no dangerous climbs, no treks into predator territory, no gambling with whether you’ve identified it correctly. When your pack is empty and your belly gnaws at itself, when you’ve burned through your rations fleeing something with too many teeth, acreleaf will still be there in the meadow grass, waiting.

The rare herbs will make you wealthy. The common ones will make you old.

Remember that.

## A WARNING REGARDING DREAD GARLIC

Found this entry in a dead man’s journal, wedged under his body in the Rotfen Marsh. The book was so waterlogged I could barely read it, but this part was clear enough:

*“The garlic here grows different. Dark skin, smell that makes your eyes water from six feet off. Local Swampers say you use it careful—one clove in a pot that feeds eight, no more. I figured they were just protecting their trade secrets. Used three cloves in my stew tonight. Tasted incredible. Writing this while it cools.”*

That was the last entry.

We found him two days later. His campfire was still smoldering. The pot was still half-full. Whatever happened to him happened fast, and he went into the deep marsh to do it. We tracked him maybe two hundred yards before we lost the trail in standing water.

The Swampers wouldn’t talk about it directly, but an old woman pulled me aside before we left.

“Dread garlic,” she said, “earned its name. It dreads nothing, and when you disrespect it, you’ll understand why. The marsh takes what it’s owed.”

I don’t know if the garlic killed him, or drove him mad, or just made him sick enough that he stumbled into something worse.

I know I don’t use it.

I know you shouldn’t either, unless a Swamper shows you how.

## ON AURORA MINT AND THE PATIENCE OF COLD

The Tundrans have a saying: “The ice keeps what the ice wants.”

Aurora mint grows in exactly three valleys I know of, all of them north of the Frostwall where the ground stays frozen eight months of the year. The leaves reflect light like they’re coated in frost even in full summer, and when you brew them into tea, the drink steams but somehow still tastes *cold* going down.

It’s worth more than its weight in silver. Merchants in the southern lodges will pay premium rates for even a small pouch. Cold-resist tonics, clarity draughts, invigorating drinks for hunters about to push into the deep ice—aurora mint is the foundation of all of them.

But you can’t rush it.

I watched a Plainsfolk trader try once. He’d hired a Tundran guide to take him to the mint valleys, and the moment they arrived, he started tearing up whole plants, roots and all, stuffing them into his pack like he was picking common meadow grass.

The guide didn’t stop him. Just watched.

On the way back, a storm came in. Not unusual for the region—the weather turns on you fast up there. But this storm came in *wrong*. The wind had teeth. The snow fell so thick you couldn’t see your own hands.

They made camp in a shallow cave. The trader kept complaining about how cold he was, how the guide should have known better, how this whole expedition was a waste. The Tundran just sat quietly, brewing tea from his own carefully harvested mint leaves.

“You want some?” he offered.

The trader accepted. Drank it down. Said it didn’t help.

“Course not,” the guide said. “You took too much. The ice knows. The mint knows. And now you’re going to learn what cold really means.”

They found the trader three days later, frozen solid ten feet from the cave entrance. The storm had passed. The guide had made it back fine.

No one accused him of murder. Everyone just understood.

The ice keeps what the ice wants. And if you’re greedy, it wants *you*.

## THE PROBLEM WITH BLACKSHELL NUT

Blackshell nuts grow deep in the old forest where the canopy blocks out the sun and the quiet makes you nervous. The shells are hard as stone—obsidian-black, smooth, heavy. You need a rock and twenty minutes of cursing to crack one open.

Inside, the meat is worth it. Rich, buttery, slightly sweet. The kind of ingredient that turns a common meal into something memorable. Elite desserts in the highland lodges use blackshell butter. I’ve seen a single nut sell for enough copper to buy a week’s worth of basic rations.

But here’s what they don’t tell you in the recipe books:

You’re not the only thing that wants them.

I was gathering blackshells once—found a good grove, nuts scattered all over the forest floor like someone had knocked them loose in a windstorm. I filled half my pack in twenty minutes. Felt like I’d struck gold.

Then I noticed the quiet.

No birds. No insects. No wind in the branches.

Just me, and the sound of my own breathing, and the feeling of being *watched*.

I looked up.

There was a bear in the grove. Not one of the small ones. Not even one of the normal big ones. This was a patriarch—probably weighed as much as three grown men, with scars across its muzzle that told you it had survived things that should have killed it.

And it was looking directly at me.

At my pack.

At *its* nuts.

I dropped the pack. Backed away slowly. Kept my eyes down—not submissive exactly, but not challenging either. Just… leaving.

The bear watched me go. Then it walked over to my pack, sniffed it once, and sat down on top of it like it was claiming a throne.

I made it maybe fifty yards before I heard the cracking sounds. The bear was eating my entire day’s worth of work, shells and all, right there on top of my pack.

I didn’t go back for it.

My point: Yes, blackshell nuts are valuable. Yes, they’re worth the trek into deep forest. But before you start filling your pack, look around. Make sure you’re actually alone. Because if you’re not—if something bigger and meaner got there first—that nut butter isn’t worth your life.

The forest keeps its own accounts, and it always collects.

## FINAL THOUGHTS FROM AN OLD FORAGER

I’ve spent forty-three years walking the Emberwild. I’ve gathered herbs on cliffsides where one wrong step meant a hundred-foot fall. I’ve pulled mushrooms from caves where the darkness felt *alive*. I’ve traded ingredients in eight different heritage lodges, learned recipes from Swampers and Highlanders and Seafarers and Mountaineers.

And here’s what I know:

The common ingredients keep you breathing. The rare ones make you wealthy. But the *knowledge*—knowing which is which, knowing when to push and when to walk away, knowing how to read the land and respect what it’s telling you—that’s what makes you old.

Every ingredient has a story. Every harvest has a cost.

Pay attention. Show respect. Don’t get greedy.

And for the love of the Heartland, **don’t put three cloves of dread garlic in your stew**.
