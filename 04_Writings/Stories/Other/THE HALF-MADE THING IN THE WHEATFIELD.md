# “THE HALF-MADE THING IN THE WHEATFIELD”

Pages torn from a small stitched journal, the hand shaky but controlled. Found near an abandoned scarecrow post north of Emberlane.

1st of Reapwind

There is something wrong in the lower field.

I noticed it first when the wheat began parting in strange shapes, not like an animal had moved through it, but as though the stalks were bending away from something they wanted no part of.

The workers refuse to go near that end now.

Jonas claimed the wind “made a circle,” but wind does not draw circles. And wind does not leave a scent like cold metal.

I will watch tonight. My father would have.

I feel I owe him at least that much.

3rd of Reapwind

I stayed up until the moon rose high, sitting in the loft with the lantern turned low. The field was still… too still. No crickets, no owls. Even the old mare refused her grain.

A figure stood at the far end.

I thought it was our scarecrow at first—same height, same crooked posture—but the scarecrow was beside the barn where I moved it two days past.

This one… leaned.

Not forward.

Not backward.

It leaned wrong, like its joints did not quite agree with each other.

I did not go out.

I am not my father.

I admit it freely here.

7th of Reapwind

It moves in daylight now.

Saw it cross through the far rows—slow, unsteady, as if walking was some new thing it had only just learned. It dragged something behind it. A sack, perhaps, or a cloak.

Jonas left. Took the other boys with him. Their mothers cursed me for not burning the field outright.

I can’t. The season’s too far gone and I’ll lose everything we’ve sown.

But tonight I will confront it.

I have the lantern. The pitchfork. My father’s knife.

And whatever courage remains.

Night of the 7th

I approached it.

Lantern high. Knife drawn.

The thing did not run.

It did not even turn.

It merely… straightened, as if remembering what that meant.

I saw clearly then:

Its limbs were not in agreement.

The left arm bent twice where it should bend once.

The right leg ended before it reached the ground, and yet it stood.

The head—too smooth, too round—tilted slowly toward me, as though measuring what shape a human ought to be.

Something inside the sack shifted.

Something that whispered.

Not words—just breath, forced through a shape not meant for speaking.

I dropped the lantern.

The flame caught.

The field burned.

I do not regret it.

8th of Reapwind

Most of the wheat is gone.

But the post where the scarecrow once hung—my father’s old post—stands charred and hollowed, and inside its ash I found something small:

A strip of my mother’s apron.

She’s been dead six years.

The thing had brought it back.

Or kept it.

Or wanted it to remember her shape.

I am leaving this place by dawn.

I will not return for the harvest.

Whoever comes after me may sow whatever courage they can muster.

But the field remains cursed.

And something half-made still walks its edges.

Trying, perhaps, to finish itself.

(The final lines are hurried, the ink smudged as though the writer closed the book too quickly.)
