# “THE NARROW ROOM UNDER WADE’S MILL”

Loose pages written in charcoal on thin ledger paper. Found bundled in oilcloth beneath a floorbeam of the old mill long after its abandonment. The handwriting shifts between steady and frantic.

—

I believe the room was always there.

Not built.

Not carved.

Not dug.

Just sealed until the day the beam gave way under my feet.

The millwrights used to joke that old Wade built the place atop a burial pit, but I never believed such talk. I worked these stones thirteen years and never felt a thing below them but the hum of the wheel.

Yesterday changed that.

The board cracked. My boot fell through.

And there—between the broken planks—was a draft of air so cold it felt like winter’s breath had found a throat to whisper through.

I should have boarded it.

I should have told no one.

But a man’s curiosity grows teeth when fed by loneliness.

So I climbed down.

—

The room is narrow.

Longer than it is wide.

Just tall enough for me to stand, though the ceiling bows like a ribcage pressed from outside.

The walls are not masonry.

Not soil.

Not bedrock.

They are smooth—too smooth—like river stones polished by centuries, yet cold as iron in a frost.

There is nothing inside except the shapes carved into the far wall.

I traced the first with my thumb:

A circle.

But not quite.

More an oval stretched thin, almost closing, almost touching at the ends.

The second was a straight line.

The third, a smaller circle set within the first.

Meaning?

None I know.

But they felt… placed.

As if drawn by someone who needed desperately to leave a record.

—

Tonight I returned with a lamp.

Oil in good measure, wick trimmed.

The carvings are deeper than I thought—cut with a tool finer than any chisel I’ve held. The grooves shimmer faintly when the lamp swings, catching light as though metal lies buried beneath the surface.

But the worst part is this:

There is writing, faint and nearly scraped away by time.

I copied what I could.

The letters are not ours, but some are cousins of shapes I know.

“When the narrow breath is taken, three will stand within the one.”

Or:

“When the narrow break is taken…”

The script is old.

Old in a way that makes the bones stiffen.

I am not a scholar.

I am a millhand.

Words like these are not meant for men like me.

—

Something moved.

I swear it.

Not in the room—no, the room has no corners for anything to hide.

It moved in the wall.

A shift, slight but certain.

Like a great beast turning in its sleep, just under the surface of the stone.

The carvings trembled. I saw dust fall—thin as flour.

The lamp guttered though there was no draft.

I climbed out faster than dignity allowed.

If the others saw me, let them laugh.

I will not go down again.

Not tonight.

—

I could not sleep.

Every creak of the mill sounded like that shifting… that turning beneath the stone.

Before dawn broke, I heard it again—faint, like a sigh let out by the earth.

The wheel above groaned though the water was low.

The beams shuddered.

The narrow room was waking.

—

I packed my things by lantern-light and meant to leave before the master arrived.

But curiosity bit me again—damn me—and I looked once more through the gap in the floor.

The room glimmered.

Not brightly.

Not warmly.

Just a thin glow like moonlight seen through deep water.

The carvings shone.

The circle was no longer straight but bending inward, its ends nearer, nearer, as though closing around something.

The inner circle brightened to a pale ring.

And then I heard the whisper.

Not words.

Not language.

Just invitation.

I fled.

I do not know if the master will find this note.

Or if the next man to work the mill will see the glow through the cracks.

But if he does—

If you do—

Hear me plainly:

Do not step below that floor.

Do not touch the carvings.

Do not answer the whisper.

For there is something beneath Wade’s Mill that wishes to stand in the place of a man.

And the narrow room is only its mouth.
