# LETTERS FROM THE LODGES

*Correspondence Between Travelers, Traders, and Those Too Stubborn to Stay Home*

---

## LETTER THE FIRST

**From: Haska Ironfoot (Mountaineer, Lodge-Keeper of Highstone Rest)**

**To: Mareen Saltborn (Seafarer, Portmaster of Tidemark)**

**Date: Third Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Mareen—

Your last shipment arrived three days late and half-frozen. The salted cod was fine. The brine kelp was acceptable. The “fresh” dewcrab you promised was *very much not fresh*.

I’m not complaining. I’m stating facts.

When I opened that barrel, the smell drove my lodge hound out the door and halfway down the mountain. He didn’t come back for six hours. I had to burn incense for two days to get the stench out of the storage room.

I sold the crab anyway. Mountaineers have strong stomachs.

But next time you promise “fresh,” I expect something that doesn’t require a funeral pyre.

On to business:

I need the following before snow closes the pass:

- 40 pounds of brinesalt (the coarse kind, not that fine-ground coastal dust)
- 20 pounds of bluepowder flour
- Kelp wraps, as many as you can spare
- One barrel of decent cider (not the swill you sent last time—Mountaineers have standards)

In return, I’m sending:

- Three elk pelts (Exceptional quality, winter-thick)
- Antler shavings (fresh, well-cured)
- Stoneginger root (your healers asked for this—apparently good for seasickness?)
- Two wheels of cave-aged cheese (you’ll know the quality when you taste it)

The pass stays open maybe another two weeks. After that, you won’t hear from me until the thaw.

Try not to send me anything dead this time.

—Haska

**P.S.** — Your nephew stopped by last week. Nice kid. Terrible climber. He made it maybe three hundred yards up the ridge before he gave up and came back wheezing. I gave him hot tea and sent him home with advice: “Stick to boats.”

## LETTER THE SECOND

**From: Mareen Saltborn (Seafarer, Portmaster of Tidemark)**

**To: Haska Ironfoot (Mountaineer, Lodge-Keeper of Highstone Rest)**

**Date: Third Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Haska—

The crab was fresh when I sent it.

Your pass is three days of hard travel through cold that would kill most of my crew. What do you *think* happens to seafood in those conditions?

Next time, order something that *keeps*.

Your shipment is already loaded. I’m sending:

- 50 pounds of brinesalt (coarse, as requested)
- 25 pounds of bluepowder flour (you’re welcome for the extra five)
- Kelp wraps (two bundles—more than you asked for, because I’m generous)
- One barrel of cider (it’s not swill, it’s *affordable*—there’s a difference)

I’m also including:

- Dried azurefin (you didn’t ask, but you’ll thank me when you taste it)
- A bottle of blackshore eel oil (your joints are going to appreciate this come winter)
- Three boxes of driftwood incense (since apparently my crab traumatized your dog)

Consider the extras a peace offering.

Your shipment is in good order. The elk pelts are beautiful—I’ve already sold two of them. The cheese is, I’ll admit, exceptional. My wife says it’s the best she’s had in five years, and she doesn’t give compliments lightly.

The stoneginger works perfectly for seasickness. My healers are already asking if you can send more in the spring.

About my nephew: He’s seventeen and thinks he’s invincible. I told him Mountaineers would either cure him of that or kill him. Sounds like you chose mercy.

I appreciate it.

Safe winter, Haska. Don’t let the snow bury you.

—Mareen

**P.S.** — My nephew said you make terrible tea. I assume this is revenge for the crab.

## LETTER THE THIRD

**From: Edrik Wyndle (Plainsfolk, Traveling Merchant)**

**To: Whoever Runs the Lodge at Thornvale Crossing**

**Date: Fourth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

To the Lodge-Keeper—

I’m writing this because I don’t know your name, and apparently neither does anyone within a day’s walk of Thornvale.

I stopped at your lodge six days ago. I needed a bed, a hot meal, and information about the northern trade routes.

What I got was:

- A bed that smelled like wet dog
- A meal that was *fine, I guess*
- Directions that almost got me killed

Let me be specific about that last part.

You told me the northern pass was “clear enough.” You said the bridge over Splitrock Gorge was “sturdy.” You mentioned, *very casually*, that “some wolves” had been seen in the area but they “mostly keep to themselves.”

Here’s what actually happened:

The northern pass was *not* clear. It was a mud-slick nightmare that cost me half a day and nearly killed my mule.

The bridge over Splitrock Gorge was *not* sturdy. It was three rotted planks held together by hope and prayer. I had to unload my entire cart, carry everything across by hand, and coax my mule over while it screamed like I was leading it to execution.

The wolves did *not* keep to themselves. I counted seven of them. They followed me for three miles. I didn’t sleep that night because every time I closed my eyes, I heard them circling my camp.

I’m alive. My mule is alive. My goods are intact.

But I will *not* be stopping at your lodge again.

I don’t know if you gave me bad information on purpose, or if you’re just dangerously incompetent. Either way, I’m passing the word to every merchant I meet: Thornvale Crossing Lodge is not worth the risk.

Consider this a courtesy warning.

—Edrik Wyndle

## LETTER THE FOURTH

**From: Garrett, Acting Lodge-Keeper of Thornvale Crossing**

**To: Edrik Wyndle (Plainsfolk, Traveling Merchant)**

**Date: Fourth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Edrik—

I got your letter.

I’m sorry your trip was difficult.

Now let me explain what you didn’t know:

Six days ago, when you stopped here, I was *acting* lodge-keeper. The actual lodge-keeper—my uncle Korren—was three days dead from a heart attack. I’d been running the lodge for less than a week. I was twenty years old. I’d never done this job before.

You asked about the northern pass. I told you what I *knew*: that it had been clear two weeks prior, when the last traveler came through. I didn’t know about the rain that turned it to mud. I didn’t know because *I was burying my uncle*.

You asked about the bridge. I told you it was sturdy because *it had been* the last time I crossed it. I didn’t know it was rotting. I didn’t know because *I’d been trying to keep this lodge running by myself*.

You asked about wolves. I told you they mostly keep to themselves because *they usually do*. Seven wolves is unusual. Seven wolves following a lone traveler is practically unheard of. I gave you the information I had.

Was it perfect? No.

Was it malicious? Absolutely not.

You want to spread the word that Thornvale Crossing Lodge isn’t worth the risk? Fine. Do it. But know that you’re punishing a kid who was doing his best in a situation he never asked for.

I’m still here. I’m still running this lodge. I’m learning.

Next time you stop—*if* you stop—I’ll give you better information. I’ll make sure the bed doesn’t smell like dog. I’ll even comp your meal as an apology.

But I won’t apologize for not being perfect when I was trying to survive.

—Garrett

## LETTER THE FIFTH

**From: Edrik Wyndle (Plainsfolk, Traveling Merchant)**

**To: Garrett, Acting Lodge-Keeper of Thornvale Crossing**

**Date: Fifth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Garrett—

I got your letter a week ago.

I’ve been thinking about it ever since.

You’re right. I didn’t know your situation. I assumed incompetence when I should’ve assumed circumstance. That was unfair.

I’ve been on the road for fifteen years. I’ve dealt with lodge-keepers who didn’t care, who gave bad information because they were lazy or drunk or just didn’t like the look of me. I assumed you were one of them.

I was wrong.

I’m sorry about your uncle. Losing family is hard. Running a lodge alone at twenty is harder.

Here’s what I’m going to do:

I’m *not* going to spread the word that your lodge is dangerous. Instead, I’m going to tell people that Thornvale Crossing has a new keeper who’s learning the job and deserves patience.

I’m also sending you something: a roll of maps. They’re copies of my personal route charts—northern pass, bridge conditions, wolf den locations, safe camping zones. They’re not perfect, but they’re current as of last week.

Use them. Update them. Share them with other travelers.

And next time I come through—and I *will* come through—I’ll take that comped meal. But I’ll also pay for the bed, because you’ve earned it.

Keep at it, kid. You’re doing better than you think.

—Edrik

**P.S.** — Fix that bed. Seriously. It *really* smells like wet dog.

## LETTER THE SIXTH

**From: Yenna Crowrath (Witch, Herbalist of Shadowfen)**

**To: Pela Duskmere (Witch, Herbalist of Longmire)**

**Date: Sixth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Pela—

I need duskleaf. Urgently.

I’ve got twelve people in Shadowfen with fever. It started slow—one case, then three, then eight. Now it’s spreading faster than I can contain it.

I’ve used everything I have: acreleaf, bluepetal, even my emergency stores of aurora mint. It’s helping, but it’s not enough. The fever breaks, then comes back harder.

Duskleaf is the only thing that’ll stop it permanently. You know this. I know this.

But my stores are empty. The last harvest failed—something in the soil wasn’t right, the plants came up stunted and wrong. I won’t have fresh duskleaf for another three months.

You grow it. I know you do. Your soil is better than mine, and you’re better at cultivation than I’ll ever be.

I’m asking: please send what you can spare. I’ll pay whatever you want—silver, ingredients, labor, favors. Name your price.

People are going to die if I can’t get this under control.

—Yenna

## LETTER THE SEVENTH

**From: Pela Duskmere (Witch, Herbalist of Longmire)**

**To: Yenna Crowrath (Witch, Herbalist of Shadowfen)**

**Date: Sixth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Yenna—

I’m sending four pounds of dried duskleaf. It’s everything I can spare without shorting my own stores.

It should reach you in three days if the runner doesn’t stop.

I’m not charging you. This isn’t a trade. This is what we do.

That said:

When this is over—and it *will* be over—we need to talk about your soil. If your duskleaf is failing, something’s wrong. Could be drainage. Could be contamination. Could be you’ve been harvesting the same plot too many years without letting it rest.

Come visit me in the spring. Bring samples. We’ll figure it out.

People don’t need to die because of bad soil.

Stay strong. You’ll get through this.

—Pela

**P.S.** — The runner’s name is Kael. He’s seventeen, fast, and *very* nervous about entering Shadowfen because he’s heard the stories. Tell him the witches aren’t going to curse him. He’ll relax after that.

---

## LETTER THE EIGHTH

**From: Yenna Crowrath (Witch, Herbalist of Shadowfen)**

**To: Pela Duskmere (Witch, Herbalist of Longmire)**

**Date: Seventh Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Pela—

The duskleaf arrived.

The fever broke within two days. All twelve patients recovered. No deaths.

I owe you more than I can repay, but I’m going to try anyway.

I’m sending:

- Six bottles of concentrated blackroot tonic (your joints will thank you)
- Two bundles of everfenn tea herb (fresh harvest, highest quality)
- A leather-bound journal full of fever treatment notes (what worked, what didn’t, what I learned)
- One wheel of bog onion and dewcrab preserve (it’s delicious, trust me)

The runner—Kael—was indeed very nervous. I told him the witches only curse people who deserve it. He asked if he deserved it. I said, “Not yet.”

He left *very quickly*.

You’re right about the soil. I’ll come visit in the spring. Bring samples, ask questions, learn how to fix this before it happens again.

Thank you, Pela.

You saved lives.

—Yenna

## LETTER THE NINTH

**From: Torvald Redbranch (Highlander, Wandering Drunk)**

**To: The Plainsfolk Inn at Grassmere Crossing**

**Date: Eighth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

To Whom It May Concern—

I believe I left my boots at your establishment four nights ago.

They’re leather. Well-worn. Probably smell terrible.

If you find them, please hold them. I’ll be back through Grassmere in two weeks.

If you *don’t* find them, that’s fine. I probably left them somewhere else.

Or I sold them for drinking money.

Honestly, I don’t remember.

—Torvald

**P.S.** — I also may have left a dagger under one of the tables. If you find that, definitely hold onto it. That one’s important.

---

## LETTER THE TENTH

**From: Mara Softstep (Plainsfolk, Innkeeper of Grassmere Crossing)**

**To: Torvald Redbranch (Highlander, Wandering Drunk)**

**Date: Eighth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Torvald—

We found your boots.

We also found:

- Your dagger (under the table, as predicted)
- Your belt (somehow wrapped around a ceiling beam)
- Three copper pieces (in the ale barrel—*how?*)
- A half-eaten loaf of bread (in the storage room, which you were *not* supposed to enter)

We did *not* find:

- Your dignity
- An explanation for how you got your belt onto the ceiling

Your items are being held behind the bar. When you return, you’ll pay your outstanding tab (two silver, four copper) plus damages to the table you broke (one silver).

After that, you’re welcome back.

But if you climb on the furniture again, I’m keeping the dagger.

—Mara

**P.S.** — Your boots smell worse than you described. I’m charging you extra for storage.
