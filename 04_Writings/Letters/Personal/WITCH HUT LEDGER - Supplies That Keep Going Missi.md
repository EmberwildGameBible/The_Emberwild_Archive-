# WITCH HUT LEDGER — “Supplies That Keep Going Missing”

*A folded list found in a locked drawer.*

Missing this week:

- two jars of crushed bark
- the long knife
- three strips of dried root
- half a bottle of antiseptic
- the good matches
- someone’s handwriting on this page who isn’t me

I’m not losing these things.

They’re being moved.

If someone’s taking supplies, fine — just say something.

But why leave no tracks?

Why put things back in places I never use?

One of the jars was warm when I found it.

Room wasn’t.

Will set a trap tomorrow.

If it’s an animal, I’ll deal with it.

If it’s a person, they’ll have explaining to do.
