# THE LETTERS OF MARLEN SOHRT

(A bundle of seven letters tied with fraying twine, found in the rafters of a collapsed barn between Ember’s End and the old mill road. All addressed, never sent.)

Letter I — Not Dated

Mam,

I know you said not to write unless the road felt safe, but truth told, there’s no road left in these parts that feels rightly so. Still, I’m writing for the sake of the habit. You always said habit keeps a man steady when the world goes crooked.

Work’s thin. Folk around here have mended their roofs for winter, and I’ve patched every fence post this side of the ridge. Been keeping to myself otherwise. Not in bad spirits—just thinking more than talking suits me these days.

Last night the wind rattled the shutters so hard I woke thinking someone was at the door. When I opened it, nothing but snow and the dark. Still, I swear I felt someone turn away before I stepped onto the threshold.

Thinking don’t make it so, I know. Sleep’s been poor.

I’ll write again soon.

—Marlen

Letter II — 3rd Frostweek

Mam,

Do you remember that carving of a hare you kept on the mantle? The one Da made the spring Jori was born?

Found one just like it on my doorstep this morning. Same notch in the ear. Same little flaw in the grain where the knife slipped.

Don’t know who left it. Don’t know why.

No tracks in the snow.

I’m keeping it on the shelf for now, though I wrapped it in cloth. Silly, maybe, but it unsettles me. Da’s been gone near seven years.

I’ll be all right. Just wanted you to know.

—M.

Letter III — 7th Frostweek

Mam,

Tomorrow I’ll go into Ember’s End for supplies, if the storm holds off. Been putting it off longer than I should—ran down to the end of my oats this morning.

There’s a sound in the barn these past nights. Not the usual creaking. More like someone shifting weight on the loft boards. I’ve checked twice with a lantern. Nothing there. Just my tools, the stacked hay, and that smell old barns get when winter tightens around them.

Still, the sound’s real.

I’m not drinking, if you’re wondering. Haven’t touched a drop since the summer after Da passed. This is something else.

Don’t trouble yourself over it—just keeping you informed like I promised.

—M.

Letter IV — 11th Frostweek

Mam,

Came back from town. Got flour, lamp oil, three nails that weren’t bent, and a new file for the drawknife.

Saw Jori’s widow in the square. She looked worn—more than grief-worn. I asked after her health. She said she hadn’t been sleeping. Said she hears someone outside her window most nights, just standing there. I asked her if she saw tracks. She shook her head.

Snow fell all day. No wind. No prints.

She said the same.

I should’ve stayed to talk longer, but the storm was coming and the road darkens early this time of year.

Wish I had stayed.

—M.

Letter V — 15th Frostweek

Mam,

Found another carving on the doorstep.

Not a hare this time. A man.

Broad shoulders. Bent posture. Head lowered like he’s carrying something he can’t put down.

It’s Da. Or it’s meant to be. Whoever carved it knew the way he stood near the end, favoring that hip of his.

I burned the carving.

It didn’t feel right to keep it, and it felt worse to throw it in the snow. Fire seemed the only clean thing to do with it.

Didn’t help. The feeling of someone watching the house hasn’t left.

Been thinking of sleeping in the barn tonight. Walls are thicker.

—M.

Letter VI — 18th Frostweek

Mam,

If this reaches you, don’t come looking.

I mean it. Don’t.

There’s something moving between the house and the treeline. I see it now. Not always with my eyes. Sometimes with the corner of them. Sometimes in the way the shadows fall wrong on the snow, like they’re bending around something that isn’t there.

Last night it laid something beside my door. Not carved. Something wrapped in cloth.

I didn’t open it.

I buried it beneath the ash pile behind the barn.

I hear it now. The boards creaking just like before, but heavier. Someone—or something—means to be let in.

I’m keeping the lantern lit. I’ve locked the door.

Again, Mam—don’t come.

—Your son, Marlen

Letter VII — Not Dated, Torn

Mam,

I didn’t open the door. I swear it. Whatever it is, it isn’t Da. Isn’t anything that was once—

(the next lines are scratched out violently)

It knows my name.

It said it through the wood. Low. Slow. As if learning how to shape the sound.

If the constable finds these letters, tell him—
