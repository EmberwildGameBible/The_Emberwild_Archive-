# “A LETTER NEVER SENT

(from Maren Thatch to her sister, Ellyn)”

This letter was found folded into the lining of a travel cloak recovered near the Fenroot Crossing. Ink water-stained. Certain words pressed harder than others, as if written through trembling.

—

My dearest Ellyn,

If this reaches you, then some benevolent hand has carried it further than mine ever could.

I write from the marsh road, where the land sinks and the lantern light grows thin. I fear I have taken a path I should not have, though the map marks it plainly enough.

I meant to arrive before nightfall, but dusk came early—

and when dusk comes early in the Fens, it is seldom for honest reasons.

I must begin with what happened two evenings past, though I wished to spare you the telling.

I heard your boy’s voice.

Clear as the day he was born, calling my name with that half-laugh he had when he chased the hens. But the road was empty. I knew it. I told myself so—“Maren, you are alone.”

Yet I looked behind me all the same.

You remember when he died. The fever took him quick, as fevers do. I still cannot reconcile the swiftness of it. When I heard him, I felt something in me buckle, like a beam in frost.

I followed the sound for five steps, no more.

Had I taken a sixth, I believe I would not be writing this.

Something moved in the reeds.

Not your boy.

The sound he made stopped all at once—

cut off, not faded.

As if a hand had closed around the throat of the world.

I ran. I do not recall my feet hitting the ground.

Tonight, I hear nothing at all. No frogs. No wind in the cattails. Even the insects hold their breath. There is a wrongness that sits on the back of my tongue, like tasting iron in the water.

If I am not imagining it, the stars are nearer than they should be. Or perhaps the earth beneath me has sunk. The marsh does that—swallows things slow as sorrow.

Ellyn, I will tell you the worst of it:

I am not sure I am alone anymore.

Not because I sense company.

Because I sense the air bending, ever so slightly, as if making room for something that is not yet here.

I have built a small fire though the ground tries to drink it. My cloak curls with the damp. I keep your boy’s ribbon in my pocket, tied tight, though I know it is superstition and nothing more.

If I do not arrive by the festival’s end, do not come searching.

I beg this of you.

The Fens do not forgive those who come looking for ghosts.

Your loving sister,

Maren
