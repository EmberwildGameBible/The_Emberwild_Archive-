# LANTERN APPRENTICE ERROR LOG — “Misreading”

*Filed at a Deep Lantern field station.*

Recorded a wrong temperature earlier today.

Misread the gauge by two points. Didn’t notice until the senior researcher checked the logs.

Nothing bad happened, but it could’ve.

If that vent had spiked and we didn’t see it, someone could’ve gotten burned.

I’m rewriting the measurements and staying late to double-check equipment.

Don’t want to be the reason we pull out of another site.
