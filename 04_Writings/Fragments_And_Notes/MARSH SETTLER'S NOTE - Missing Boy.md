# MARSH SETTLER’S NOTE — “Missing Boy”

*Pinned to the doorframe of a stilted hut in the wetlands.*

If anyone sees **Leven** — boy, short hair, wearing a brown coat — send word.

Last seen heading toward the north flats, chasing some stray critter.

Ground’s soft out that way. There’s water under places that look solid.

We searched until dark. No sign.

If you go looking, take a pole. Test every step.

Don’t call his name too loud. Sound carries strange across the flats.

Bring him home if you find him.
