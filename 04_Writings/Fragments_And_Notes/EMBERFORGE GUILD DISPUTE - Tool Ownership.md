# EMBERFORGE GUILD DISPUTE — “Tool Ownership”

*Filed at an Emberforge Guild outpost.*

Complaint:

Worker **Davin** claims **Rott** took his hammer and chisel before morning shift, without permission, and damaged them.

Rott says the tools were already worn out.

Davin insists they were new as of last week.

Supervisor ruling:

Tools will be replaced from guild stock.

Davin and Rott will work separate lines until further notice.

Guild note:

If either of them tries this again, both are suspended.

We don’t have time for petty arguing when the vents are this unstable.

— **Foreman Jakk**
