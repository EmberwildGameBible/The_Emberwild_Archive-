# PIRATE CREW REPORT — “Fight on Deck”

*Unsent note found in a Shattercoast tavern.*

Had a scrap on deck last night. Not a big one, but loud enough to wake half the crew.

Started over a barrel of dried fish. Ended with two men overboard and one with a broken arm.

We fished them out. They’ll live.

Told the quartermaster to lock the stores better. People are jumpy this season. Weather’s been bad. Makes everyone short-tempered.

If the captain asks, tell him it’s handled.

No need to make a whole show out of it.
