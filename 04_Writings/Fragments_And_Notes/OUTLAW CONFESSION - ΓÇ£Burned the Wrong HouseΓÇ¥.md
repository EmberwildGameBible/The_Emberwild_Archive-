# OUTLAW CONFESSION — “Burned the Wrong House”

*Recorded by a Heartland patrol on a torn scrap.*

It wasn’t the right house.

Didn’t know until after I saw the kid inside.

Thought it was Brann’s place — wrong fence, wrong yard.

Fire spread too fast. Couldn’t do anything.

I’ll turn myself in tomorrow.

Just needed to write it down first.

Didn’t sleep last night. Won’t sleep tonight.

Nobody deserves that.

Not them.

Not the kid.
