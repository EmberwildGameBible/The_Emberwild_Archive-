# HEARTLAND FAMILY LETTER — “What the Doctor Didn’t Say”

*Folded, water-stained letter found inside an old clothing chest.*

Ma,

Doctor says Pa’s sickness isn’t spreading fast, but I don’t believe him.

He hasn’t stood up in two days.

His breathing’s shallow and he keeps gripping at the floor like it’s slipping away.

He won’t drink.

Won’t open his eyes much.

Just keeps mumbling about “heat in the soil.”

We haven’t been near a vent in months, so I don’t know what he means.

Might be fever talk.

I’ll keep him warm. Keep him fed if he’ll take it.

But if he gets worse, I’m sending for you.

Don’t worry yet.

Just be ready.
