# MARSHFOLK RECIPE-NOTE — “Bog Stew for Cold Nights”

*Found in a clay jar tied shut with swamp reed.*

Ingredients (in order of respect):

— two handfuls of bogroot

— one strip of marshback meat

— three cups water (never river water, only marsh water; river water insults the stew)

— pinch of black salt

— emberpepper if you trust your tongue

Notes from Elder Rime:

- Never cook this stew during low tide. The steam mingles with the rotfog and draws things.
- If the stew boils too fast, tell it a story. Marsh water calms when spoken to.
- If the broth turns red, pour it out immediately. That means the ground beneath you isn’t sleeping.

This recipe has kept our family warm for four generations.

You can always taste the difference between those who respect the marsh and those who think they’re only passing through.
