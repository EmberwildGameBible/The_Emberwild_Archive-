# FOREST SURVEY REPORT — “Sound Carried Wrong”

*A detailed official report from a Greatwood ranger.*

Patrol Date: 3rd of late-light

Location: Eastern Greatwood

Personnel: Darrin Vale, Lysa Renn, Merra Toft

Report Summary:

- Heard snapping branches ahead. Thought it was a stag.
- Sound didn’t match distance.
    
    (Loud like it was close, but fading like it was far.)
    
- Ground was soft but no tracks found.
- Air felt heavier than usual; no wind.

Set markers and returned by the same route.

When passing the same point, heard the noise again — identical, like it repeated itself.

Marking this area as unstable.

Not geological — something else affecting sound.

Recommend avoiding until further notice.

Not dangerous yet, but unpredictable.
