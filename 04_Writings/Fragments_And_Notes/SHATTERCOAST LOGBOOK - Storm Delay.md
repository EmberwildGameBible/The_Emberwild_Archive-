# SHATTERCOAST LOGBOOK — “Storm Delay”

*A captain’s log entry pulled from a damaged cargo crate.*

Wind shifted before dawn. Waves aren’t matching the direction they should.

Feels like a storm’s building offshore.

Crew wants to push out anyway. Told them no.

Lost a boat last year because someone thought the sea “looked fine.”

We wait a day. Anyone who doesn’t like it can take a rowboat and prove me wrong.

Cargo’s secure.

Deck’s good.

Weather’s not.
