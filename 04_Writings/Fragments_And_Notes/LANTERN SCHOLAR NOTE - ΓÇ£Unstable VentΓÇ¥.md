# LANTERN SCHOLAR NOTE — “Unstable Vent”

*Filed by a researcher at a field station.*

Vent 47 is acting strange. Temperature rose three degrees since yesterday.

Air’s shifting down there — feels like a draft, which makes no sense.

I’m marking it unsafe for the time being.

Students keep trying to approach it without proper gear.

If one of them slips, the station’s closing for a week while we deal with the fallout.

Need to talk to the guild contact. If this vent opens up any wider, we’ll have to pull equipment.

Not worth anyone getting hurt.
