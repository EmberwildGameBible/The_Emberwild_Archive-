# GREATWOOD WORK CREW INCIDENT — “Fallen Oak”

*A work ledger entry from a lumber camp.*

Large oak came down faster than expected.

Rotted through the base — hollow inside. Didn’t look that way from the outside.

Nearly crushed two workers.

One bruised, one shaken. Could’ve been worse.

We’re marking the whole stretch as unstable.

No more cuts in that area until someone checks the soil. It’s damp in ways it shouldn’t be for this season.

We’ll move up the ridge tomorrow.

Better footing there.
