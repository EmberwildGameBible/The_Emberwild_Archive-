# PRISON SCRATCHES — “Counting Days Wrong”

*Etched into the wall of a crude holding cell in the Greatwood frontier.*

```
|||| |||| |||| |||| ||
|||| |||| |||| |||| ||
|||| |||| |||| |||| ||
||||

```

Beneath it, in scratched writing:

> “I can’t tell if these are days or just marks.”
> 

No body was found in the cell when discovered.

Door had not been opened in two weeks.
