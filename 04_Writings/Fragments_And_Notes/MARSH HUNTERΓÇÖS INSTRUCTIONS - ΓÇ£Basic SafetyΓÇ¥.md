# MARSH HUNTER’S INSTRUCTIONS — “Basic Safety”

*Handwritten list found nailed inside a marsh shelter.*

For anyone new to this place:

1. Step where the ground’s dark, not shiny.
2. If something looks like dry land but dips when you look at it, test it first.
3. If birds leave suddenly, crouch. Don’t run.
4. Don’t follow tracks unless you know what made them.
5. Keep your hands away from the water unless you see the bottom.
6. Don’t argue with locals about the marsh. We know what we’re talking about.

Take what you read seriously.

New people make mistakes.

Mistakes get you stuck.
