# FARM LEDGER — “Crop Loss”

*Found in a barn office.*

Lost two rows to pests this week.

Lost another to the tremor’s dirt shift.

Weather’s been decent at least.

Need more hands before next planting.

If Joren doesn’t return with the tools he promised, we’ll have to improvise.

If next season’s as bad as this one, we’ll move uphill.
