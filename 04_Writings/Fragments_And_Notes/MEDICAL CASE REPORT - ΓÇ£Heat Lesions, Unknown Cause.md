*Filed by a frontier medic in the Ember-Scar Range.*

Patient brought in complaining of dizziness after exploring a shallow fissure near the ridge line.

Symptoms:

- patchy skin discoloration
- tingling in hands
- mild fever
- visible twitching in left arm
- sensitivity to heat

Treated with rest and cool compresses.

Symptoms worsened by next morning.

Closer inspection showed small red marks along the arm that looked like burns but weren’t painful.

Patient insisted nothing touched him except “warm air.”

Ordered evacuation to Heartland clinic.

Patient refused, said he “felt fine now” and tried to leave.

Collapsed outside the tent.

Transport confirmed.

Clinic informed that exposure may be heat-related but *not* from normal vents.

Recommend checking area for secondary openings.
