# PERSONAL LETTER — “House Feels Wrong”

*Letter found in a drawer of an empty Heartland farmhouse.*

Ma,

I know you think I’m overreacting, but the house doesn’t feel right lately.

It’s not the weather. And it’s not the tremors.

It’s small things.

The chair pulled out in the morning.

Boots moved a foot from where I left them.

Lantern blown out when there wasn’t any draft.

I’m not scared. Just uneasy.

Might be someone coming in at night.

Might be my head.

I’ll stay with the neighbors for now.

Come check the place with me next week.
