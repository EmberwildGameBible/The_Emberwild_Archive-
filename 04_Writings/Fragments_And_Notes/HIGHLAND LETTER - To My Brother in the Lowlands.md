# HIGHLAND LETTER — “To My Brother in the Lowlands”

*A folded note carried by a northbound courier.*

Brother,

You asked why I haven’t visited since the frost came in.

Because the frost isn’t the same as it was when we were boys.

The winds don’t whistle anymore. They howl. The cliff paths crumble under their own breath. Last week, the old cairn above Stoneback Pass cracked straight down the middle — and Mother swore she heard something breathing inside it.

We’ve hunted these mountains since before we learned to shave, and I’ve never heard the snow move like that. It shifts in waves. Like something beneath it is rolling over in its sleep.

If the Heartlands are quiet, enjoy the quiet.

The highlands haven’t slept in months.

P.S. If you see a caravan heading north, tell them to turn around. They won’t believe you, but say it anyway.
