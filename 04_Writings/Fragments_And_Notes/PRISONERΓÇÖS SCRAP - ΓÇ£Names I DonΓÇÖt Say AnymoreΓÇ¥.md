# PRISONER’S SCRAP — “Names I Don’t Say Anymore”

*A torn piece of cloth with handwriting pressed in like the author had no ink.*

I don’t use names anymore.

Not mine, not theirs.

Makes it easier.

First one screamed.

Second didn’t.

Third begged.

Fourth tried running.

Didn’t get far.

Fifth and sixth weren’t supposed to be there at all.

Wrong house. Wrong night. Wrong everything.

Stopped counting after that.

Stopped caring too.

The world doesn’t notice people like us.

Just makes room when we disappear.

If you’re reading this, you won’t find me.

I know the dark places better than any of you.
