# BLACKSMITH’S PRIVATE INSTRUCTION — “What Not to Do”

*A private note kept behind a forge counter.*

If you’re new:

- Don’t hit cold metal. You’ll crack it and hurt yourself.
- Don’t use the long tongs for heavy work. They bend.
- Don’t stare at the coals too long — heat dries your eyes out.
- Don’t add water to the quench without checking the temperature.
- Don’t wear loose sleeves near open fire.

Most injuries happen because someone forgets one of these.
