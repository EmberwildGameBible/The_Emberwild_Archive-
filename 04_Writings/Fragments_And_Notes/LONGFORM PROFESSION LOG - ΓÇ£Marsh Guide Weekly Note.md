# LONGFORM PROFESSION LOG — “Marsh Guide Weekly Notes”

*A proper long entry, in the correct grounded tone.*

Week was long but not rough.

Monday:

Walked two travelers across the north flats.

One nearly stepped into a soft patch — caught him in time.

Told them to keep their poles steady. They listened.

Tuesday:

Fog rolled in earlier than usual.

Stayed put.

No reason to rush people into places they don’t understand.

Wednesday:

Found a torn pack near the reed wall.

Not sure whose it was.

No blood, no tracks, nothing taken.

Pack still had food inside, which is strange.

People don’t abandon food unless something spooked them fast.

Thursday:

Guided a trader through the east marsh.

Good man. No trouble.

Ground was firmer than usual.

Friday:

Checked the raised walkway.

Nails rusting.

Will need repairs.

Saturday:

Rest.

Listen to the water.

Make sure it hasn’t shifted under the boards.

Sunday:

A quiet week is a good week.
