# LOST EXPEDITION NOTE — “Second Day”

*A page recovered from a damaged pack deep in the Breachlands.*

Day 2.

Ground’s uneven here. Hard to tell which cracks are shallow and which ones open into something worse.

We tried laying markers, but the wind keeps knocking them over.

Haven’t seen wildlife today. That’s either good or bad. Hard to tell.

Water’s running low. We misjudged the route — thought we’d find a stream by now.

No turning back. The ridge behind us collapsed during the night.

If anyone finds this:

Don’t take the lower valley. It’s slower than it looks.
