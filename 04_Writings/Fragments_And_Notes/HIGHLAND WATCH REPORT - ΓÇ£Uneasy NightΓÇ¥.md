# HIGHLAND WATCH REPORT — “Uneasy Night”

*Written by a night watchman at a cliffside post.*

Quiet night. Too quiet.

Wind usually carries noise from the lower paths — animals, shifting rock, anything.

Tonight? Nothing.

Could be weather. Could be snow holding sound back. Hard to say.

Still makes my neck feel tight.

Saw movement near the old cairn. Probably just shadow. If it were something real, we’d have heard it.

Still, I’m keeping the torch lit.

Better cautious than stupid.
