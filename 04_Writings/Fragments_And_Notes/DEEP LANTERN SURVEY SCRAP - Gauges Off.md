# DEEP LANTERN SURVEY SCRAP — “Gauges Off”

*Unlabeled paper found near an abandoned station kit.*

Gauges are showing inconsistent readings. Could be a cracked seal or just worn gear.

We’ll replace everything tomorrow.

The vent’s pressure feels higher than last week.

Hard to prove without proper numbers, but you can hear the change if you stand close.

Not dangerous yet, but the students need to stop climbing the rocks near the mouth.

If the vent opens, it’ll be sudden.

Going to mark it as restricted until we know more.
