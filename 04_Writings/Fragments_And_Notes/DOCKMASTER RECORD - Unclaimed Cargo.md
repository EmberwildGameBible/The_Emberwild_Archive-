# DOCKMASTER RECORD — “Unclaimed Cargo”

*A long-form log entry from the Shattercoast.*

Ship: *Wavemark*

Docked: Last sun, day 17

Issue: Unclaimed cargo

Crate #27 went unclaimed. No crew member marked it.

Weight’s odd — heavier on one end.

No sound when shaken. No smell.

Opened it this morning.

Inside were thirty small metal spheres.

All with faint heat to them.

Not dangerous to touch but uncomfortable.

No merchant claims them.

No guild seal.

Moved the crate to storage.

Told the night crew not to go near it.

Not locked, but marked.

If nobody claims it by next week, we’ll hand it to the guard.

Feels like something someone didn’t want found.
