# MINER’S LOG — “Heat in the Stone”

*Recovered from a collapsed Ember-Scar dig site.*

Shift 3 — Day 22

Stone’s warm again. Barely noticeable, but warm enough to bother me.

Told the overseer. He says it’s normal. Been mining thirty years and haven’t seen “normal” stone get this warm this fast.

Crack near the south wall widened. Put a plank over it so nobody twists an ankle.

Feels like air moving under there. Don’t like that.

Tools clatter on their own sometimes. Probably the tremors. Probably.

We’ll finish the week and pull out.

If the ground wants to move again, I don’t want to be standing on top of it when it does.
