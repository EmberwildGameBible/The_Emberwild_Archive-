# FRONTIER GUARD REPORT — “The Ridge Collapse”

*Found in a supply crate at the edge of the Highlands.*

**Report from: Jorin Thale**

**Location: Northbreak Ridge**

**Status: Partial**

We walked the ridge at first light. Snow was thin but stable enough.

Halfway through the pass, the ground gave a small shake. Nothing major, but enough to worry the new recruits.

Ten minutes later we heard the crack. Not loud. More like stone tearing slowly.

The whole west wall slid maybe two feet. Could’ve been worse if it went all at once.

Lost a pack mule. Didn’t lose the supplies, at least.

Recommend avoiding the ridge for a few days. It’s holding, but just barely. There’s fresh air coming through the cracks, which means hollow space below.

We don’t need another fall-through.
