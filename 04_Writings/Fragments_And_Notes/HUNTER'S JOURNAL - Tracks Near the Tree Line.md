# HUNTER’S JOURNAL — “Tracks Near the Tree Line”

*A ripped-out journal page found in the Greatwood Belt.*

Day 14.

Found tracks again near the old tree line. Same ones as last week. Heavy, wide steps. Something big. Doesn’t match anything I know.

Whatever it is, it’s walking slow.

Not stalking — just moving.

Ground’s firm where it passed. No drag, no limping, no blood. Healthy animal.

Didn’t see it, but heard branches shifting deeper in. Didn’t sound panicked or aggressive. Just… passing through.

I’ll check again tomorrow, but I’m not going in after it. Doesn’t seem interested in people, and I’d like to keep it that way.

If someone else finds this, don’t go looking for it.

Nothing good comes from trying to be curious out here.
