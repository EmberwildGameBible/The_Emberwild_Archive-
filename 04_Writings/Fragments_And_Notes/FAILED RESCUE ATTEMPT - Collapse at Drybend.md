# FAILED RESCUE ATTEMPT — “Collapse at Drybend”

*Pulled from a collapsed tunnel clearing.*

Tried to reach the trapped group at Drybend.

Got within twenty yards before the ceiling gave out again.

Air’s bad down there — dust heavy, hard to breathe.

Couldn’t risk going further without causing another collapse.

Marking the site closed.

If anyone else tries to dig them out, they’ll just add more bodies to the pile.

We’ll try again when the tremors calm.
