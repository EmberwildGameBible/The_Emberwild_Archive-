# DEAD ADVENTURER’S POCKET NOTE — “If Found”

*Recovered from a body near a collapsed tunnel.*

If someone finds this, I’m probably gone.

Tunnel felt wrong when we went in. Air tasted stale. Walls were sweating — never seen that before.

We pushed too far. Roof gave out near the back. Crushed half the group.

I’m stuck. Can’t move my leg. Not much else to say.

Take whatever you need from my pack. Don’t waste it.

If you can, send word to my sister in the Heartlands. Name’s Lira.

Tell her I tried.
