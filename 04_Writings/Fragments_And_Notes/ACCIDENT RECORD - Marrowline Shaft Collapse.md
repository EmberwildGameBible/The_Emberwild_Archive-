# ACCIDENT RECORD — “Marrowline Shaft Collapse”

*Filed at a guild station.*

Shift B suffered collapse in Marrowline Shaft.

Two injured, one missing.

Cause unclear — shaft supports looked stable yesterday.

Recovery team sent.

Ventilation poor.

Rescue won’t be fast.

Workers reminded to check support beams, not just the floor.

We’re stretched thin as it is.
