# ABANDONED EXCAVATION JOURNAL — “Something Under the Sand”

*A multi-entry scrap found in the Dustwarr Drylands.*

**Entry 1:**

Found a dip in the sand that looks like a collapsed tunnel.

Digging around it tomorrow.

**Entry 2:**

Sand keeps falling back into the hole.

Feels like something is shifting underneath.

Not big — small movements, like settling.

**Entry 3:**

Hit stone.

Not natural.

Flat surface, too even.

Could be old structure.

**Entry 4:**

Heard tapping.

Not echo.

Not our tools.

Nobody else heard it.

Said I imagined it.

**Entry 5:**

Sand fell in fast today.

Whole slope collapsed inward.

Nobody fell, but it was close.

We’re pulling out.

Whatever’s under there isn’t worth digging up.
