# LONGFORM WITCH JOURNAL — “Patient Study: S.”

*Found tucked under a broken bedframe.*

Patient: **S.**

Found outside hut at dawn.

Cold. Weak. Barely coherent.

Day 1:

Patient says he came from the ridge path.

Keeps saying the same line: “It moved under me.”

Won’t describe what “it” is.

Treated for exhaustion, bruises, dehydration.

Left leg swollen.

Day 2:

Swelling worse.

Skin warmer than expected — not fever warm, a different kind of heat.

Patient sleeping in short bursts.

Keeps waking up asking if the ground is “steady.”

Day 3:

Leg split along the side during the night.

Not blood — fluid. Clear, hot.

Doesn’t make sense.

Cleaned wound but it keeps weeping.

Patient quiet now. Breathing shallow.

Day 4:

Patient passed before sunrise.

Buried behind hut.

Keeping notes for reference.

Not sure what he encountered, but I won’t be walking that ridge path any time soon.
