# BURNED FARMHOUSE NOTE — “After the Fire”

*Found pinned under a scorched beam.*

House is gone.

Fire took the whole north side before we could get water to it.

We’re staying with neighbors until we can rebuild. If you’re looking for us, check the stone barn near the crossroads.

Livestock is safe. Tools are not.

If you come by, bring nails. A lot of them.
