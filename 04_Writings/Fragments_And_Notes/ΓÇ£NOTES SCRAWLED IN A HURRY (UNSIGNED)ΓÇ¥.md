# “NOTES SCRAWLED IN A HURRY (UNSIGNED)”

Found beneath a loose floorboard in an abandoned river hut east of Brambleford. Ink smeared. Sentences break, restart, change tone, as though the writer kept stopping to listen.

—

Keep your voice low.

Keep your breath quieter still.

I write this because I can no longer trust my own remembering. The nights keep taking pieces. Bit by bit. I wake with less than I lay down with.

If I do not set it to paper, it slips.

First night:

Scratching on the door. Light, like a mouse or something smaller. But the dog heard it too—ears flat, teeth bare, tail between his legs.

He would not approach the door.

Not even when I called him close.

Whatever it was, it knew the wood’s soft places.

—

Second night:

Voices outside. Not speaking—shaping sounds. Like someone learning a language by running their fingers over it first.

The dog whined the whole time. When I opened the shutters at dawn, there were prints in the mud that did not match the scratching. Wider. Deeper.

Something leaned close enough to fog the glass.

I could see where the breath left it.

—

Third night:

I should have left after the second but the river was high and the path was drowned. I tried to sleep with my boots on. The dog lay on my chest, shaking so hard his teeth clicked like stones.

Near midnight the river went silent.

Rivers do not go silent.

Heard a splash like something rising—not entering, rising—from the water. Heavy. Then another. Then nothing. The dog pissed himself. So did I, nearly.

—

Fourth night:

They are closer.

I heard them beneath the floorboards. Not walking—dragging. The boards bowed. The nails creaked. When I tried to pray, the words felt like I was speaking them into someone’s cupped hands.

Something whispered back.

Not in any tongue I know, but I recognized my own name inside it.

The dog barked once—sharp, broken—and then fled through the shutters. I did not stop him. If he lives, he is wiser than I.

—

Tonight:

If I hear them again, I won’t wait for morning. I will run. Even if the river takes me. Even if I drown. Better the river’s stomach than whatever moves in the dark on hands not meant for earth.

If anyone finds this—if the ink has held—

Do not stay in this place.

Do not sleep near the river when it falls quiet.

Do not answer if something calls your name from under the floor.

Some things do not want you.

Some things want the shape you leave behind.

(The last lines trail off into a jagged tear, as though the page was ripped from the writer mid-stroke.)
