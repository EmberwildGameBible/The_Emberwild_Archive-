# HUNTER TRAINING NOTE — “Reading Tracks”

*Written on a thin piece of bark-paper in the Greatwood.*

When reading tracks:

- **Deep prints:** heavy animal or soft ground
- **Shallow prints:** small animal or dry soil
- **Staggered pattern:** injured
- **Short steps:** cautious or stalking
- **Long stride:** running

If prints vanish suddenly, look up.

Branches break easily in this part of the forest.
