# “AUTUMN BY THE EAST FEN ROADSIDE”

(A simple folded note, rain-warped at the edges, found pinned beneath a stone along the East Fen road. It reads like something not meant for many eyes—perhaps only for the one person it was written to.)

—

Marlen,

I know you said you would not come this way again, not after what happened to the Fen guardhouse and how the water kept rising for days though the sky was clear. But if you do pass by—if stubbornness or grief or the moon drags you where your sense won’t—I’ve left this here for you.

The road changes now.

Not washed out. Not overgrown.

Changed.

The reeds lean in the direction of no wind. The mud holds prints that no man, beast, or cart laid. I counted fourteen impressions this morning, all long and narrow and sunk deeper than my own weight could make. They run parallel to the road, like something walked beside me for an hour without breaking stride.

I didn’t hear a thing.

And the water. Marlen, the water’s wrong. It doesn’t lie flat anymore. Some mornings it hums—low, like a voice carried through a wall. Other mornings, the surface puckers though nothing breaks it, as though something beneath is exhaling. Once, I saw a reflection that wasn’t mine or any tree or sky above me. A face. Wide, pale, with eyes like lantern-glass.

It watched the corner of the bank where I stood until I stepped back.

The reflection did not step back.

I know why you keep away. I know why you shutter your windows at dusk and why you told me not to make the walk alone. I know what happened to your father on the night he took the low crossing—how they found his lantern still burning, still swinging, as though held by a hand that wasn’t there.

But, Marlen… I keep hearing him.

Not his voice. I’m not a fool. But something carries his old whistle-song across the reeds at dusk. You remember the one—the three short, one long. The warning call he used when we were children playing in the far fields. It comes from the direction of the guardhouse ruins. And every time, it stops the instant I move toward it.

Your mother says I should forget it. She says the Fen holds sounds the way trees hold wind, that it keeps echoes longer than it should.

But you and I both know the Fen never kept that long.

If you come through, don’t take the low crossing. Don’t step near the old guardhouse. Do not answer any whistle, no matter how familiar. Sound carries strange here, and not all of it belongs to the living.

I’ll meet you at the split stone by midday tomorrow.

If I’m not there, turn back. Do not wait, not even a breath.

—Rellan

(On the back of the note, barely legible under water damage, a second hand has scrawled a short message: “Rellan never came to the stone. I waited. Spirits guide him.”)
