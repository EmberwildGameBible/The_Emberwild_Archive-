# OUTLAW MANIFESTO — “Why We Do It”

*Found nailed to a tree along a Heartland road.*

People say we steal because we’re desperate.

Some of us are. Some aren’t.

Truth is simple:

There’s not enough room for everyone to live the way they want.

Not with the land changing under our feet every season.

Not with guilds taking every strip of ground that holds value.

Not with towns growing faster than they can feed themselves.

The law looks one way.

We look another.

We take what others can’t protect.

We do what others pretend isn’t happening.

If the world won’t make room for us, we’ll carve our own place.

Come stop us if you think you can.
