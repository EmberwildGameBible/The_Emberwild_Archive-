# RANGER AMBUSH REPORT — “Cliffside Attack”

*A folded note left at a ranger outpost.*

Patrol 3 was attacked near the mid-cliff path.

Looked like scavengers at first, but they were organized — waited behind rocks, came down from above.

We drove them off with no casualties, but they’re getting bolder.

Someone’s teaching them how to use terrain properly. That’s the worrying part.

We’ll reinforce the next patrol and avoid the south edge. Too many blind spots.
