# HISTORICAL FRAGMENT — “Account of First Emberfall Winter”

*A surviving page from an early-era ledger. Longer entry.*

Winter after the Emberfall was the worst in memory.

The ground stayed warm in some places long after the vents cooled.

Snow melted in irregular patches — left muddy sinkholes where people used to walk.

Whole settlements shifted.

Some moved uphill. Some moved inland.

Some vanished without record.

Game animals were scarce.

Forest creatures migrated in strange patterns.

Marshes froze on top but stayed fluid underneath.

Folk who survived agree on one thing:

Trust nothing that looks stable after a quake.

Children born that year were small.

Livestock mostly died.

People wrote warnings in the snow for others passing through:

> GROUND NOT SAFE
> 
> 
> **TURN AROUND**
> 
> **VENT OPENED**
> 
> **CARRY WATER**
> 

Few of these messages lasted.

Storms covered them.

Only memory kept the lessons alive.
