# ABANDONED CARAVAN NOTE — “Left Behind”

*A torn canvas sheet nailed to a wagon frame.*

Wheels snapped on the lower track. Rear axle’s done for.

We tried fixing it but the slope’s too soft and the ground keeps shifting when we brace under it.

Took what we could carry and headed for the ridge path.

If anyone passes through, take whatever is left. Don’t bother trying to haul the wagon — you’ll just get yourself stuck.

If you see a pack of grey hounds trailing the road, make noise. They kept circling us.

We’ll try for Splitwater by night.
