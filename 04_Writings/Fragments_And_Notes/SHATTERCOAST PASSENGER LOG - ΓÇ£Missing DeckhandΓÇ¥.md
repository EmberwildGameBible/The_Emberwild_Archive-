# SHATTERCOAST PASSENGER LOG — “Missing Deckhand”

*Pulled from the captain’s locked drawer.*

One of the new deckhands didn’t return after shore leave.

Name listed as **Renn Tovik**. Young, quiet. Didn’t talk much.

No sign of trouble in the port. No blood, no fight, no commotion.

He just didn’t show.

Crew’s uneasy about it. Said the sea was rough that night, but that’s nothing new.

Man could’ve slipped walking back alone. Happens more than people admit.

Filed his name under “lost.”

If he turns up, we’ll sort it out then.

— **Captain Holk**
