# KILLER’S JOURNAL SCRAP — “Second One”

*Found behind a loose board in an abandoned barn near the Marsh edge.*

Second one didn’t fight much.

Thought he would. Looked the type.

I took him after dark when he was checking traps.

Dragged him off the path before he could yell.

Soft ground covered most of the noise.

I keep waiting for guilt or something, but there’s nothing.

Feels like fixing a mistake nobody else wants to deal with.

He knew what he did.

They all do.

If someone finds this, it’s too late.

I’m not done yet.
