# “FROM THE LEDGER OF MASTER HALDRIN VALE: ON THE MATTER OF LOST APPRENTICES”

(A formal record kept by a guildmaster of the Forester Carvers’ Hall. The ink is steady, the tone clipped—written by a man trying very hard to remain composed.)

4th Day of Deepwinter, Year 82 After the Sundering

Filed under: Missing Persons – Apprentices – Unresolved

Let it be set to parchment, for the sake of record and in the duty owed to their families, what is known—

and what cannot yet be spoken with certainty.

Two of my apprentices, Garron Telle and Wrenna Holt, departed the Hall on the morning of the 3rd to retrieve timber fallen in the northern thaw. Both were capable, both steady-handed, both familiar with that stretch of ridge. They carried the long saw between them and provisions enough for three days’ work.

They did not return.

At sunrise this morning, Forester Renn found their saw halfway down the ridge path. The teeth bore no stain of work. The handles were warm to the touch despite the cold, as though set down moments before.

Their tracks were found for a time—

two sets, walking side by side, the smaller one slightly behind—

but the prints ended abruptly seven paces shy of the split cedar.

Not faded.

Not washed.

Not drifted over.

Ended.

As if the snow beneath their boots had been pressed smooth by a great palm.

Renn noted a third absence: the birds. The ridge is known for its winter thrush gatherings, yet not a single feather nor cry was heard that morning. Even the fox dens lay quiet.

I have sent word to the Northlook Wardens, who will search beyond the marked paths where our Hall men may not tread without sanction. Still, formality demands that I make note of the following:

—No sign of struggle

—No indication of avalanche

—No scent of blood found by the hounds

—No broken branches at any height

—No witness save the silent ridge itself

Wrenna’s father stood before me this evening asking for truth, and I—guildmaster these twenty years—could give him none. Not because truth is absent, but because it hides beneath something I do not yet understand.

He asked if I believed the old tales of the ridge hollows—those stories of soundless places where the air folds strangely, where a man’s steps may go on though his body stands still.

I told him no.

I lied.

There is one final detail I have recorded only here:

Renn claims the saw, when discovered, was pointed toward the hollow called Grey’s Maw—an eroded cleft the elders bar us from entering since the Sundering years.

If this is true, then the apprentices went willingly toward that place, though no task or training would have taken them that way.

I pray this mystery ends with the living found cold and hungry, and not with spirits unsettled.

Until then, the Hall keeps the candles lit and the doors unlatched for their return.
