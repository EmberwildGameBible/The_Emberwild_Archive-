# HEARTLAND LETTER — “Road Trouble”

*Delivered to a caravan master in the Temperate Heartlands.*

Road past Splitwater isn’t safe right now.

Two wagons sank into soft ground after the tremor last night.

No injuries, but the cargo’s done.

We’re rerouting through the north track. Takes longer, but it’s stable.

If anyone comes through your way, tell them not to risk the shortcut.

It’s not worth the time they think they’re saving.
