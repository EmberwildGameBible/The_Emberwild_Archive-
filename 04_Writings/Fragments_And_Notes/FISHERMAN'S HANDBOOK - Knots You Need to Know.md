# FISHERMAN’S HANDBOOK — “Knots You Need to Know”

*A training page from a Shattercoast guild.*

### **Basic Knots**

**Boathitch:**

For tying to posts. Holds well even in wet conditions.

**Linekeeper:**

For tying two ropes together. Only use if you trust the other rope.

**Snapknot:**

Breaks under load if pulled too hard. Useful if something drags the boat.

**Netbind:**

Secures nets. If it comes loose, the whole catch’s gone.

Practice knots every morning.

Bad knots sink boats.
