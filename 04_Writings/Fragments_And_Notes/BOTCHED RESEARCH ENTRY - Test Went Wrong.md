# BOTCHED RESEARCH ENTRY — “Test Went Wrong”

*Note found in a small Emberforge workshop.*

Test 14 failed.

Compound separated under heat and spat out half the mixture before I could shut the vent.

Burned my arm. Not bad, just stings.

Lost two days’ worth of ingredients though. That hurts more.

Need to rethink the ratio.

Resin’s too unstable on its own.

Maybe if I crush the ore finer, it won’t react so hard.

Workshop smells like metal and smoke now.

Going to step outside for a while.

Head’s pounding.

If anyone uses the bench, *don’t touch the left side*.

It’s still hot.
