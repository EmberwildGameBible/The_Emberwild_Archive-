# DEEP LANTERN EXPERIMENT NOTE — “Exposure Test”

*A sealed paper found in a cracked metal container.*

Exposure Time: 27 minutes

Subject: Fragment C-17 (amberstone shard)

Results:

- Surface temperature rose 3 degrees
- Minor vibration felt through gloves
- Faint sound when placed on metal (unconfirmed)
- Residue left on cloth, corrosive to skin

We need proper containment.

Until then, nobody touches this without protection.

One apprentice tried shifting it with bare hands.

He’s fine, but the burn marks aren’t going away.

Closing note:

Not sure we should be studying this.

Feels like we’re pushing our luck.
