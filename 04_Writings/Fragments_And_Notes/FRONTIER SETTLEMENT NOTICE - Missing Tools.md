# FRONTIER SETTLEMENT NOTICE — “Missing Tools”

A simple notice — but too specific to be a normal theft.

Some tools have gone missing over the last week:

- two saws
- three shovels
- a pry bar
- a lantern
- a short rope
- water jug
- blanket

All taken at night.

Doors weren’t forced.

Dogs didn’t bark.

If anyone knows who’s doing it, speak up.

These aren’t random items.

Someone’s preparing for something.
