# COMPANION TRAINING NOTES — “Basic Handling”

*Written on rough parchment found near an animal pen.*

Keep your voice calm.

Don’t make movements you don’t mean.

Feed them before training; hungry animals don’t listen.

Give them time to understand commands.

Don’t punish confusion — only disobedience.

If the animal stares fixed at something behind you, move away slowly.
