# Order — Travel Pass Requirement for Bulk Lamp Oil

*A stiff notice sheet, posted crooked and re-nailed twice. The corner is torn where someone tried to pull it down.
The ink at the bottom is darker, as if written in haste—or after dusk.*

**Issued by:** Harrow Field Council (Trade & Safety Committee)  
**Filed by:** Council Clerk’s Office  
**Date:** Late Harvest, Day 19  
**Posting Locations:** East Gate / Wellpost / Council Steps / “Wherever folks will complain loudest”  
**Order Code:** HF-C/TS-19-LAMP

## BY COUNCIL ORDER (READ IT BEFORE YOU GET FINED)

Effective immediately, the transport of **lamp oil in bulk** through Harrow Field jurisdiction requires a valid **Travel Pass**.

This includes:
- sealed tins
- barrels
- “old stock”
- “clear stock”
- “salvaged stock”
- and anything else that burns long enough for someone to do something stupid beneath it

This order applies to:
- the East Fen Road
- Marshline Way (within our ditch-markers)
- and all side-tracks that join them “by accident”

---

## WHY THIS ORDER EXISTS (OFFICIAL REASON)
Due to:
- increased night theft of settlement tools (rope, nails, lantern hoods)
- unsafe sale of “old stock” lamp oil
- and repeated incidents of flame behavior “not consistent with honest fuel”

…the Council has determined that bulk oil shipments require oversight “for the safety of citizens.”

*(If you laughed while reading that line, pay the fine like everyone else.)*

---

## WHAT COUNTS AS “BULK”
Any lamp oil transported in:
- **10 or more tins**, or
- any **barrel**, or
- any container declared “for resale,” or
- any container accompanied by **more wick-twine than a household needs**

If you attempt to split a bulk shipment into “many small shipments,” you will be treated as if you are clever.
Harrow Field does not reward clever.

---

## WHAT A VALID TRAVEL PASS MUST INCLUDE
A Travel Pass must be presented at the East Gate or at any watch checkpoint upon request.

Pass must include:
1) **Carrier Name** (and wagon mark, if applicable)  
2) **Origin** (declared depot or seller)  
3) **Destination** (declared buyer or market)  
4) **Quantity** (tins/barrels)  
5) **Batch Mark** (“clear,” “old,” etc.)  
6) **Trade Office Stamp** (sheaf over crossed nails)  
7) **Witness Initials** (Trade Office runner or appointed clerk)

Passes without all seven elements are invalid.

Passes with all seven elements may still be questioned.  
Do not argue with a person holding the fine-book.

---

## FEES & FINES (PAYABLE IN COIN, NOT BUTTONS)
**Travel Pass Fee:** 3 copper per bulk shipment  
**Inspection Fee (if requested):** 1 silver (non-refundable)  
**Fine for transport without pass:** 2 silver + confiscation of excess oil  
**Fine for forged stamp:** 10 silver + public notice + “further action”

*(Further action means the Council decides how bored they are.)*

---

## INSPECTION PROCEDURE (IF YOU’RE SELECTED)
A selected shipment may be inspected for:
- seal integrity
- stamp authenticity
- odor (“fen-cut,” “smoke-cut,” “sweet-cut,” “metal-cut”)
- flame behavior (tested by appointed flame-keeper)

**IMPORTANT:**  
Any oil that burns:
- green
- silent
- sideways
- or toward a person who isn’t holding the lantern  
…will be held “pending determination.”

*(Determination takes as long as it takes. Don’t ask.)*

---

## EXEMPTIONS (RARE AND TEMPORARY)
Exemptions may be granted to:
- shrine processions carrying sanctioned flame
- watch escorts under signed order
- Council-approved emergency supplies during storm weeks

Any exemption must be written in ink, not charcoal.
Any exemption written in green ink is suspicious.  
Yes, we know someone will try anyway.

---

## NOTES FOR CARRIERS (UNOFFICIAL BUT TRUE)
- If you are paid in **buttons**, you are not being paid.
- If the seller will not say where the oil came from, it came from somewhere that wants to remain unnamed.
- If a clerk offers to “speed it up” for a favor, the favor will not end at the desk.

## SIGNATURES & SEALS
**Trade & Safety Chair:** Edrin Mallow (mark: E.M.)  
**Council Clerk:** [initials blurred by a thumbprint]  
**Watch Witness:** Jarr (East Gate)

**Stamped:** *(wax impression: sheaf over crossed nails)*

*(At the bottom, a second stamp appears faintly—like it touched the page by mistake: three wavy lines under a wheel.)*

---

## MARGIN ADDITIONS (NOT PART OF THE ORDER)

In smaller handwriting, likely from someone who reads too much:

- “They’re not regulating oil. They’re regulating *light*.”  
- “Inspection fee is a bribe with manners.”  
- “Second stamp on this posting—cartage mark? Why?”  
- “If the Council shed lock was intact, who keeps taking what they ‘confiscate’?”

A final scratch, pressed hard enough to tear the paper:
“**Ask Brin** why his mark is on tins he didn’t press.”
