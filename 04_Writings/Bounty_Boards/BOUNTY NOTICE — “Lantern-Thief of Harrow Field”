# BOUNTY NOTICE — “Lantern-Thief of Harrow Field”

A frontier posting nailed to wet wood. The ink has run once and been traced over.

**Issued by:** Harrow Field Council  
**Jurisdiction:** Harrow Field and the East Fen Road  
**Charge:** Theft of settlement tools; endangerment by night removal of light and rope  
**Reward:** 30 silver + Council Favor (winter ration priority)

---

## DESCRIPTION (READ THIS OR GET LOST)
Moves at night.

Doors weren’t forced. Dogs didn’t bark.

Leaves wet prints where the ground is dry.

Carries a short lantern low, hooded, like a coal that refuses to die.

## KNOWN HISTORY (AS FILED)
- **Born:** East Fen roadside camp — *where people learn to watch water more than sky.*
- **Formerly:** Emberforge Guild runner (unverified)
- **Noted for:** quiet steps; knowing which boards won’t creak
- **The Incident:** dismissed after bringing “warm stone” to a toolhouse (the toolhouse stayed warm for three days)

## ASSOCIATES / SIGNS
- **Known contacts:** a traveling tinker called “Berrin”; a lantern-apprentice seen at dusk
- **Marks / tells:** smell of lantern oil and fen-water; right glove patched with black thread
- **Preferred ground:** reed beds, ditch-lines, culverts, old mile-stones

## LAST VERIFIED SIGHTING
**Where:** the east ditch beyond the council sheds  
**When:** three nights past  
**Witness:** watchman (name withheld), who swears the lantern-light “bent” when it passed

## WARNING
If you follow into the reeds, bring rope you can afford to lose.

Do not go alone.

## RUMOR (UNVERIFIED)
“They’re gathering tools for someone beneath the Ember-Scar stone.”

*(Another hand has added: “Or the stone is gathering THEM.”)*

**Seal/Stamp:** *(wax seal: a rough sheaf-mark over crossed nails)*

## ARCHIVE NOTES (DEV)
- **Links (add later):** the “Missing Tools” notice; Deep Lantern field notes; Emberforge Guild catalog scraps
- **Leads to:** a small “culvert cache” micro-location (stash of stolen tools + a weird warm stone chip)
- **Payoff:** unlock a hidden tinker vendor OR a lantern-apprentice contact who starts a longer chain
