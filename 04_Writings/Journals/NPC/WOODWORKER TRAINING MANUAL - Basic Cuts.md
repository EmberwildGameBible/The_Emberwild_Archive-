# WOODWORKER TRAINING MANUAL — “Basic Cuts”

*A page from a beginner’s woodworking guide.*

### **Straight Cuts**

Use the full length of the saw. Don’t shorten the motion.

If the wood splinters, check the grain — cut with it, not against it.

### **Joint Cuts**

Mark the joint twice before cutting.

If you only mark once, you’ll be off by a finger-width.

### **Tool Care**

Don’t leave saws in damp places.

Oil the blade once a week.

Check handles for cracks — loose handles cause accidents.

### **Final Note:**

If something feels wrong with the wood, set it aside.

Don’t fight difficult pieces. There’s always another board.
