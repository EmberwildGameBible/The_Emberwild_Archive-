# THE LODGE-KEEPER’S JOURNAL

*Being the Private Records of Maris Thornwell, Keeper of Deepwater Rest, Forester Territory*

## ENTRY 1 — FIRST SNOW

**Date: Ninth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

The first snow came early this year.

Not the dusting kind. Not the gentle kind that melts by midday. The *serious* kind—six inches overnight, wind howling through the gaps in the shutters, cold so sharp it makes your teeth ache.

I woke up to find icicles hanging from the eaves and a family of Plainsfolk huddled on my doorstep.

Five of them: mother, father, two children, one grandmother. They’d been caught on the trail when the storm hit. The father had frostbite on three fingers. The youngest child—couldn’t have been more than six—was blue around the lips.

I got them inside. Started a fire. Made tea with aurora mint from my emergency stores (which I’m *not* supposed to use except for emergencies, but a half-frozen child counts).

The father kept apologizing. Kept saying they’d pay, they’d work it off, they didn’t mean to be a burden.

I told him: “You’re not paying. You’re not working. You’re drinking this tea, warming up, and staying until the storm passes. That’s the job.”

He looked confused. Like he’d never heard of a lodge-keeper who didn’t charge for storm shelter.

I didn’t have the heart to tell him that if I charged everyone who stumbled in here half-dead, I’d be the richest woman in the Emberwild—and also a monster.

The grandmother thanked me. Said something in Plainsfolk dialect I didn’t fully understand, but it sounded like a blessing.

I hope it works. This winter’s going to be long.

## ENTRY 2 — THE HUNTER WHO WOULDN’T LISTEN

**Date: Tenth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

A hunter came through yesterday. Young. Maybe twenty-five. Had that look—the one that says “I’ve killed three wolves and now I think I’m invincible.”

He wanted to know about the deep woods. Specifically, about the old growth territory northwest of here.

I told him: “Don’t.”

He asked why.

I said: “Because there’s a great cat that’s claimed that territory. Big one. Been there at least five years. It’s killed two hunters I know of, maybe more I don’t.”

He laughed. Actually *laughed*. Said: “I’ve killed cats before.”

I said: “Not like this one.”

He said: “I’ll be fine.”

I gave him the speech. The one I give to every cocky hunter who walks through here:

*“The Emberwild doesn’t care how good you think you are. It doesn’t care about your kill count or your reputation or how many pelts you’ve sold. It will test you. And if you fail, it will kill you. And no one will find your body until spring, if at all.”*

He nodded like he was listening.

He wasn’t listening.

He left this morning, headed northwest. I watched him disappear into the tree line with his bow strung and his pack light and his confidence unshaken.

I’m writing this down so that when someone comes looking for him in two weeks, I have a record of what I told him.

I hope I’m wrong.

I’m usually not.

## ENTRY 3 — THE SWAMPER’S OFFERING

**Date: Tenth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

A Swamper stopped by today. Older woman, maybe sixty, with hands that looked like they’d spent a lifetime in mud and brine.

She didn’t ask for shelter. Didn’t ask for food. Just walked up to the lodge, set a wrapped bundle on the doorstep, and said: “For the children.”

Then she left.

I opened the bundle.

Inside: three wheels of preserved bog onion and dewcrab, a bottle of blackroot tonic, dried everfenn tea herb, and a note that just said *“Heard you took in a Plainsfolk family during the storm. The marsh remembers kindness.”*

I don’t know how she knew about the family. They left two days ago.

I don’t know how she knew we were running low on medicinal supplies.

I *definitely* don’t know how she knew the grandmother had a cough that wouldn’t quit.

But Swampers know things. That’s their gift—and their curse.

I’m keeping the blackroot tonic for the next sick traveler. The tea herb will last us through winter. The preserved dewcrab is already in the storeroom.

And the note? I’m keeping that too.

Because sometimes you need a reminder that kindness echoes.

## ENTRY 4 — THE ARGUMENT ABOUT BREAD

**Date: Eleventh Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Two travelers almost came to blows in my common room today.

Over *bread*.

Here’s what happened:

Traveler One: Tundran, early thirties, been on the road for weeks. Orders food. I serve him what I have—standard Forester fare. Stew with arbor elk, amberroot, acreleaf. Side of hard bread.

He eats the stew. Tears into the bread. Makes a face.

“This is awful,” he says.

Traveler Two: Forester, late forties, looks like he’s been hunting since before I was born. He’s sitting three tables over.

“That’s good bread,” he says.

Traveler One: “It’s dry. It’s tasteless. It’s like chewing bark.”

Traveler Two: “It’s *supposed* to be dry. Lasts longer. Doesn’t mold. You can carry it for weeks.”

Traveler One: “I don’t care if it lasts forever. It tastes like failure.”

Traveler Two: “You know what tastes like failure? *Starving* because your bread went bad after three days.”

They keep going. Back and forth. Tundran talking about how Tundrans make frostbite bread that’s soft and rich and actually edible. Forester talking about how Foresters make bread that *works*, that keeps you alive, that doesn’t need to taste good to do its job.

I let them argue for ten minutes. Then I slammed a ladle on the counter.

“Enough.”

They both shut up.

I said: “You’re arguing about bread. *Bread*. Do you know how stupid that is?”

Traveler One: “But—”

Me: “No. Listen. The Tundran makes soft bread because the Tundra is *cold*. You need dense calories. You need fat. You need something your body can break down fast for warmth. That’s smart.”

I turned to the Forester.

Me: “The Forester makes hard bread because the *forest is wet*. You need something that won’t spoil. Something you can carry through rain and humidity without it turning into a moldy mess. That’s *also* smart.”

I looked at both of them.

Me: “You’re both right. You’re both making the bread your region needs. And you’re both idiots for thinking your way is the only way.”

They stared at me.

Then the Tundran laughed.

Then the Forester laughed.

Then they bought each other drinks and spent the rest of the night trading recipes.

I don’t know what I expected, but it wasn’t *that*.

## ENTRY 5 — THE HUNTER CAME BACK

**Date: Eleventh Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

The cocky hunter came back.

He’s alive.

Barely.

He stumbled into the lodge three hours past sunset, bleeding from a gash across his shoulder, his bow snapped in half, his pack torn to shreds.

I got him inside. Cleaned the wound. It was deep—claw marks, four parallel lines. Great cat, no question.

He didn’t say anything while I worked. Just stared at the fire with the kind of hollow look you get when you’ve seen something that breaks you.

When I finished bandaging him, I asked: “What happened?”

He swallowed. Took a long time to answer.

“I found the cat,” he said.

“And?”

“It found me first.”

He told me the story:

He’d tracked it for two days. Found prints, scat, claw marks on trees. Felt like he was closing in.

Then he realized the tracks were *leading* him. The cat wasn’t running. It was *baiting* him. Drawing him deeper into its territory.

By the time he figured it out, it was too late.

The cat hit him from behind. Knocked him flat. Tore his pack open. Snapped his bow like it was a twig.

Then it just… *sat* there. Five feet away. Watching him.

He said: “It could’ve killed me. I know it could’ve. But it didn’t. It just looked at me. Like it was saying, ‘You’re not worth it.’”

Then it walked away.

He lay there for an hour before he could move. Took him another six hours to make it back here.

I asked: “Are you going back?”

He looked at me like I’d just suggested he cut off his own hand.

“Never,” he said. “I’m never going back there.”

Good.

Maybe he learned something.

## ENTRY 6 — WINTER STORES

**Date: Twelfth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

Took inventory today. Here’s what we have:

**Food:**

- 40 pounds of amberroot (enough for three months if we’re careful)
- 20 pounds of dried arbor elk meat
- 15 pounds of hard bread (Forester style, since apparently that’s a controversy now)
- Acreleaf (plenty—it grows everywhere)
- Amberweed (dried, stored in the cellar)
- One wheel of cheese (bog onion and dewcrab, gift from the Swamper)
- Assorted preserved goods (jams, pickled vegetables, smoked fish)

**Medicine:**

- Blackroot tonic (two bottles)
- Everfenn tea herb (one bundle)
- Aurora mint (half a pouch—emergency use only)
- Bluepetal (dried, for minor fevers)
- Bandages, needle and thread, basic field surgery tools

**Firewood:**

- Enough for two months if we ration carefully
- Need to chop more, but the snow’s getting worse

**Other:**

- Six wool blankets (three are worn thin—need patching)
- Two sets of spare clothes (for travelers who arrive soaked or frozen)
- Candles, lamp oil, flint and steel

It’s enough. Barely.

If we get a steady stream of travelers, we’ll be fine. If we get a bad storm and no one comes through for weeks, we’ll tighten belts and make it work.

That’s the job.

## ENTRY 7 — THE CHILD WHO ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS

**Date: Twelfth Moon, Year of the Ash Wind**

A family stayed here last night. Plainsfolk again—different from the ones during the first snow. Parents, three children.

The youngest—maybe eight years old—wouldn’t stop asking questions.

“Why is the lodge so far from the village?”

“Why do you live here alone?”

“Aren’t you scared?”

“What do you do when no one comes?”

“Have you ever seen a bear?”

“Do you have a husband?”

“Why not?”

The parents kept apologizing. Kept trying to shush her.

I didn’t mind.

I answered every question:

The lodge is far from the village because travelers need shelter *between* villages. That’s the whole point.

I live here alone because someone has to, and I’m good at it.

I’m not scared because I know the land. Fear comes from not understanding. Once you understand, it’s just… respect.

When no one comes, I chop wood, repair things, read, think. Silence isn’t emptiness. It’s just space to breathe.

Yes, I’ve seen bears. Many bears. I leave them alone. They leave me alone. Mostly.

No, I don’t have a husband.

Because I don’t want one.

She thought about that last answer for a long time.

Then she said: “I think I want to be a lodge-keeper when I grow up.”

Her mother looked horrified.

I smiled.

“Come back in ten years,” I said. “I’ll teach you.”

## ENTRY 8 — THE LONGEST NIGHT

**Date: Midwinter, Year of the Ash Wind**

Midwinter’s here. Longest night of the year.

I made the traditional stew—arbor elk, amberroot, barkroot, acreleaf. Nothing fancy. Nothing expensive. Just the kind of meal that says: “I survived this far. I’ll survive the rest.”

I ate alone. The lodge is empty tonight. No travelers. No guests. Just me, the fire, and the wind outside.

Some people think Midwinter is sad when you’re alone.

It’s not.

It’s *quiet*. There’s a difference.

I spent the evening thinking about the people who’ve passed through here this year:

The Plainsfolk family with the frozen child. The cocky hunter who learned humility. The Swamper who left kindness on my doorstep. The Tundran and Forester who argued about bread. The little girl who wants to be a lodge-keeper.

They’re all out there somewhere. Living their lives. Surviving their own winters.

And I’m here. Keeping the fire lit. Keeping the door open.

That’s the job.

And I’m good at it.

## ENTRY 9 — SPRING THAW

**Date: First Moon, Year of the Frost-Break**

The ice is breaking.

I heard it this morning—that deep cracking sound, like the earth itself is waking up. The river’s moving again. The snow’s melting. The air smells different.

Spring’s coming.

That means:

- Travelers will start moving again
- Trade routes will reopen
- Hunters will push deeper into the woods
- I’ll need to restock everything we burned through during winter

It also means I survived another year.

The lodge survived.

The people who stopped here survived.

That’s worth something.

## ENTRY 10 — A VISITOR

**Date: Second Moon, Year of the Frost-Break**

Someone knocked on the door today.

I opened it.

Standing there: a girl. Maybe eighteen. Plainsfolk. Carrying a pack, a bedroll, and a nervous smile.

“Are you Maris Thornwell?” she asked.

“I am.”

“I’m Kessa. I was here ten years ago. With my family. During the first snow. You gave us shelter. Saved my little sister’s life.”

I remembered. The blue-lipped child. The aurora mint tea. The father with frostbite.

“I remember,” I said.

She smiled wider. “I’m here to learn. If you’ll teach me.”

I looked at her. Really looked. She had the right build—strong, but not bulky. She had the right eyes—sharp, aware, patient.

She had the right question in her expression: *Can I do this?*

I stepped aside. Held the door open.

“Come in,” I said. “Winter’s over. Now the real work begins.”

She walked inside.

And I thought: *Maybe I won’t be alone next Midwinter.*

Maybe that’s worth something too.
