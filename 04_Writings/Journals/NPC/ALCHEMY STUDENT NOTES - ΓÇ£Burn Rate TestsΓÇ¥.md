# ALCHEMY STUDENT NOTES — “Burn Rate Tests”

*Found in a ruined alchemy shed.*

Test 1:

Mixture burned too fast. Lost half the ingredients.

Test 2:

Burn rate slowed but left residue. Not usable.

Test 3:

Added crushed mineral. Helped stabilize heat. Jar cracked from pressure though.

Test 4:

Burned clean. Writing formula below.

*(Formula section torn out.)*

Test 5:

Tried repeating the clean burn.

Different result.

Flame jumped out of the pot.

Need better containers.

Heat-resistant clay maybe.
