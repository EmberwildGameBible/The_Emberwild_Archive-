# FISHING LOG — “Shattercoast Trip #12”

*Pulled from a waterproof satchel.*

Trip #12

Weather bad at first light — wind too sharp. Stayed onshore until it eased.

Caught:

- 3 small flatfish
- 1 good-sized grayfin
- something heavy that snapped the line before I saw it

Saw lights under the water again.

Crew says it’s just the way sun hits the sand shelf, but we weren’t in shallow water.

Boat creaked twice on the return.

Going to check the hull tomorrow.
