# TRAVELER’S DIARY — “First Steps into the Heartlands”

*Recovered from a torn leather satchel near an abandoned waypost.*

Day 3 on the south road.

Can’t say much for the caravans out here. They move quick and speak little, eyes on every tree line. I thought they were being dramatic until the second tremor hit.

The ground didn’t shake hard — just enough to remind me why they call this place Emberwild. The old man on the wagon said, “It ain’t the quake that kills you. It’s what crawls out after.”

I laughed. No one else did.

Saw a red crack running across a distant hill tonight. Looked like the land exhaled light. I asked if that was normal. The old man said, “Depends on what you mean by normal.”

If I live long enough to write a second notebook, I’ll call that progress.
