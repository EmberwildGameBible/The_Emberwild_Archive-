# WITCH FIELD INSTRUCTIONS — “Herb Collection Notes”

*Written on a thin scrap of paper found near a small hut.*

For whoever collects the herbs next:

- Pick only the green-stem roots. The red ones are too old — they break when dried.
- Don’t yank them. Twist them out slow or the soil caves in.
- Keep everything in the clay jar. The metal tins contaminate the mixture.
- Bring extra water. The trail back is longer than it looks.
- Don’t wander. If you hear running water, you’re off the path.

That’s all.
