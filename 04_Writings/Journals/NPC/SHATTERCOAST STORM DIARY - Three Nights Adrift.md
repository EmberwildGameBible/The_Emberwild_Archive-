# SHATTERCOAST STORM DIARY — “Three Nights Adrift”

*Recovered from a half-rotted driftwood crate.*

**Night 1:**

Storm hit harder than expected. Lost the mast.

Food’s soaked; blankets too.

Crew kept it together. Nobody panicking yet.

**Night 2:**

Waves quieter today. Still no land.

Saw debris from another ship — not ours.

Means we’re drifting into bad waters.

One of the anchors broke loose and slammed a crate. Nearly took a man’s leg off.

**Night 3:**

Wind died down.

Sea’s flat.

Too flat.

No birds.

No clouds.

No drift.

It feels wrong.

Saw lights underwater after dark.

Not bright. Just moving.

Crew wants to paddle.

I’m not sure where.

If someone finds this:

We were somewhere west of the Shattercoast.

Tell my brother I didn’t quit.
