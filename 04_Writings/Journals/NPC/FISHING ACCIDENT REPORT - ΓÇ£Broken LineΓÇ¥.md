# FISHING ACCIDENT REPORT — “Broken Line”

*A short field report by a Shattercoast deckhand.*

Line snapped on the deep cast.

Not normal — rope was new.

Crew thinks it caught on rock.

I think something pulled it.

Whatever it was, it moved fast.

Water barely rippled.

Marking this spot.

Not coming back here soon.
