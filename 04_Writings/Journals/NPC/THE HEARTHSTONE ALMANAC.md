*Recipes, Traditions, and Entertainments of the Eight Heritages*

## **FORESTER MIDWINTER STEW** *(Served on the Longest Night)*

**What You Need:**

- 2 parts arbor elk meat, cubed
- 1 part amberroot, chopped thick
- 1 part barkroot for body
- Handful of acreleaf (dried is fine)
- Amberweed to taste
- Creek salt
- Rendered alderfenn fat
- Water enough to cover

**The Tradition:**

Foresters mark Midwinter—the longest night of the year—not with celebration, but with *survival*. The old teaching says: “If your family can gather around a hot pot when the dark is deepest, you’ve done enough.”

This stew is deliberately simple. It uses common ingredients, things any Forester household should have even in the leanest months. The point isn’t luxury. The point is **sufficiency**.

You start the pot at dusk. You don’t serve it until full dark has settled and someone—usually the eldest—has checked the lodge perimeter, the woodpile, the tool shed, and confirmed that everything is secured for winter.

Only then do you eat.

My grandmother used to say the stew tastes better when you’ve earned it. I didn’t understand until the winter I spent alone after my first companion died hunting. I made the stew by myself, in a one-room lodge, with wind howling through gaps in the shutters I hadn’t yet learned to seal properly.

It was the best meal I’d ever had.

Not because of the recipe. Because I’d *survived* to eat it.

**The Cooking:**

Brown the elk meat in alderfenn fat until it stops bleeding. Don’t rush this. Add the roots and enough water to cover everything by two fingers. Bring it to a boil, then drop it to barely bubbling.

Let it go for three hours. Stir occasionally. Add the acreleaf and amberweed in the last twenty minutes.

Season with creek salt. Serve with hard bread if you have it.

Eat slowly. Speak quietly. Remember the people who didn’t make it to this Midwinter.

Then sleep, knowing you’ll wake up to dawn.

## **TUNDRAN FROSTBITE BREAD** *(New Year’s First Meal)*

**What You Need:**

- 3 parts driftwheat flour
- 1 part bluepowder flour
- Arctic rhizome, grated fine
- Aurora mint, crushed (just a pinch—this is expensive)
- Creek salt
- Breezewater (cold as you can get it)
- Rendered fat for the pan

**The Tradition:**

Tundrans celebrate the New Year at first thaw—not when the calendar says, but when the ice finally cracks and the rivers start moving again. It’s the moment when you know you *survived* another winter.

The first meal of the new year must be bread baked in a cast-iron pan over an open flame. No ovens. No lodges. You go outside, build a fire on bare ground, and cook this bread in the cold air while the river breaks behind you.

Why?

Because if you can make bread in the cold, you can make anything. It’s a test. A proof. A way of saying: “I’m still here. I’m still strong. The ice didn’t keep me.”

The aurora mint is optional, but traditional families insist on it. It represents *clarity*—the ability to see what’s coming and prepare for it. Without clarity, the Tundrans say, you’re just waiting to freeze.

**The Cooking:**

Mix the flours, grated rhizome, and salt. Add the crushed aurora mint—seriously, just a pinch. This stuff is potent.

Work in cold breezewater until you have a shaggy dough. Knead it with cold hands (this is part of the test) until it’s smooth.

Pat it flat into a disk. Heat your pan over the open fire until a drop of water dances on it.

Grease the pan with rendered fat. Lay the bread down. Cook until the bottom is golden and crisp, then flip. The top will puff slightly if you’ve done it right.

Serve immediately, torn into pieces, shared with everyone who made it through winter with you.

The first bite is always silent.

The second bite, you’re allowed to speak.

## **HIGHLANDER RIDGEWALK CAKES** *(Coming-of-Age Trial)*

**What You Need:**

- 2 parts crispwheat flour
- 1 part brownrice, cooked and cooled
- Honey (any kind, but auric honey if you’re trying to impress)
- Brightspice
- Antler shavings (yes, really)
- Creek salt
- Enough water to bind it

**The Tradition:**

When a Highlander child turns fourteen, they walk the Ridgeline alone. Three days, two nights, carrying nothing but a knife, a waterskin, and these cakes wrapped in arbor leaf.

The cakes are made by the family the night before. Everyone participates—mother grinds the grain, father cooks the rice, siblings mix the dough, grandparents press the antler shavings into the top of each cake before baking.

The antler shavings aren’t for flavor. They’re symbolic. Antlers represent **resilience**—they fall off, they grow back, stronger each time. The Highlanders say: “You’ll fall on the Ridgewalk. What matters is whether you get back up.”

These cakes are dense, filling, and they don’t spoil quickly. They’re designed to keep a young Highlander alive during the hardest trial of their youth.

If the child returns with uneaten cakes, they’re considered too soft. Not ready. They walk again next year.

If they return with crumbs and stories, they’re welcomed as adults.

**The Cooking:**

Mix flour, cooked rice, honey, brightspice, and salt. Add water slowly until it forms a stiff dough.

Divide into palm-sized portions. Flatten each one into a thick disk.

Press antler shavings gently into the top of each cake.

Bake on a stone near the fire until firm and golden. They should be hard enough to survive being carried in a pack for three days.

Wrap in arbor leaf. Tie with alpine vine.

Give them to someone you believe in.

## **STONES & BONES** *(A Highlander Gambling Game)*

**What You Need:**

- 6 small stones (river stones work best—smooth, roughly equal size)
- 6 small bones (finger bones from hunted game, cleaned and dried)
- A flat surface
- 2–6 players
- Something to wager (copper, rations, tasks, pride)

**The Rules:**

This is a game of **bluffing, memory, and calculated risk**. Highlanders play it in lodges during winter, around fires during hunts, and in taverns when they’re far from home. It’s older than anyone can remember.

**Setup:**
Each player gets 3 stones and 3 bones. You hold them hidden in your hand or a pouch.

**The Round:**
Players take turns placing one item (stone or bone) face-down in the center. You don’t reveal what you placed.

After everyone has placed, you start the *calling phase*.

**Calling Phase:**
Starting with the youngest player, each person makes a claim about what’s in the center:

- “There are four stones.”
- “There are more bones than stones.”
- “There are exactly two bones.”

You can call someone a liar. If you do, all items are revealed.

- **If the claim was true**: the accuser loses a stone or bone (their choice) to the center permanently.
- **If the claim was false**: the liar loses a stone or bone to the center permanently.

**Winning:**
Last player with any items left wins the pot (everything wagered at the start + all forfeited items).

**The Strategy:**

Stones are worth more than bones in most Highlander traditions—they represent **permanence**, while bones represent **sacrifice**. Good players will bluff about having more stones than they actually do.

The trick is reading faces, remembering what people placed in previous rounds, and knowing when to challenge.

I’ve seen fortunes change hands over this game. I’ve also seen lifelong friendships start because someone called a bluff at exactly the right moment and both players laughed until they couldn’t breathe.

**Highlander Saying:***“Stones hold. Bones break. But liars? Liars always pay.”*
