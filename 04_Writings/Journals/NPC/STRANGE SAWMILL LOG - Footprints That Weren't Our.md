# STRANGE SAWMILL LOG — “Footprints That Weren’t Ours”

Found in a ledger at a Greatwood lumber camp.

Tracks seen behind the mill.

Small, barefoot, running stride.

Deep impressions.

Too wide for a child.

Followed them thirty yards until they stopped abruptly.

Not faded. Stopped.

Ground ahead undisturbed.

Will set a watch tonight.
