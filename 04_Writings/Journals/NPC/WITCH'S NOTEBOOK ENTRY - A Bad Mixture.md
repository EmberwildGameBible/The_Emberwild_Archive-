# WITCH’S NOTEBOOK ENTRY — “A Bad Mixture”

*Found near a burned-out camp, pages singed around the edges.*

I mixed the wrong thing today. Should’ve checked the heat before adding the resin.

The whole batch went off too fast — popped loud enough to scare the birds out of the trees.

No serious harm. Lost half the supplies, burned my sleeve.

Still better than what happened to the last apprentice who tried rushing this step.

I’ll try again in the morning.

Need to trade for more resin first. Don’t feel like boiling roots all night just to make up what I lost.

If anyone finds this note before I get back:

Don’t touch the pot.

It’s not safe yet.
