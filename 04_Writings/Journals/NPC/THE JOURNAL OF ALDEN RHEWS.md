Entry — Cold Month, 12th Day

Woke with the ache in my ribs again. Weather turning.

Couldn’t stay in bed—roof leaks when the snow gets heavy, and the bucket was near full.

Went to the storehouse to fetch a new plank. Found the old trap of Father’s instead. Nearly stepped on the damned thing. Could almost hear him laughing. “Watch where your feet fall, boy,” he used to say. “The ground keeps score better than men do.”

I cleaned the trap. Don’t know why. Habit, I suppose.

Entry — Cold Month, 14th Day

Saw a woman walking the tree line before dawn.

Not trespassing—just walking, slow, her hands behind her back like she was thinking hard on something.

Didn’t call out. Folks walk early when they’ve got things gnawing at them.

Who doesn’t these days?

Found her tracks later. Small feet. Light step. Almost no weight. Strange she left any print at all in this snow.

Entry — Cold Month, 17th Day

Ma’s chair creaked last night.

No one sat in it.

House settles, I tell myself. Old timber speaks in winter.

Still, I moved the chair to the far wall. Didn’t sleep.

Found an old letter of hers tucked behind the stove stones.

Half burned. Couldn’t read most. Only one line remained clear:

“I hear your voice when I pass the orchard.”

I don’t know who she meant. Father? Someone before him?

She never told me everything. Parents don’t.

Went to the orchard myself tonight.

Didn’t hear a thing.

But standing between those trees in the frost—

I understood why she wrote it.

Sometimes a place holds more of a person than we do.

Neighbor’s boy, Jore, came by with a basket of coarse flour. Said his mother baked too much, but the way he said it… no, she sent it because she’s worried. Folks notice when you stop coming to market.

I thanked him. Gave him one of Father’s carvings in return. A little bird. He smiled, but I think he only took it so he wouldn’t hurt my feelings.

Good boy.

Dreamt of the library in Thornhearth. Haven’t been in years.

Saw the long tables… the dust motes in the tall windows…

and someone sitting with their back to me, bent over a book too old to touch bare-handed.

They turned a page.

And I woke.

Hands shaking. No reason for it.

Sometimes the mind pulls up things it has no business remembering.

Entry — Cold Month, 30th Day

A fox was lying on the step this morning. Curled tight.

Dead, but not stiff yet.

I buried it by the birches.

Couldn’t bring myself to skin it.

Father would’ve scolded me for that.

Entry — Cold Month, 32nd Day

Storm coming. Big one.

Sky’s gone white at the edges, and the air smells like iron and wet stone.

If the roof gives out tonight, well—

Suppose it’s only fitting. Been living on borrowed beams since Father passed.

I’ll write again if the morning takes me.
