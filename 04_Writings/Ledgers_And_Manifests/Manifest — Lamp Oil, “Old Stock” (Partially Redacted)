## INSPECTION FINDINGS (CLERK’S SUMMARY)

### 1) “Old Stock” problem
Three buyers reported the “old stock” lamp oil burns:
- *too bright for a breath* then
- *too low for a prayer* then
- *sideways* (as if the flame is listening elsewhere)

One buyer claims the oil “won’t catch” unless spoken to.  
The clerk refuses to write down what was spoken.

### 2) Tin stamp mismatch
Most tins show: **PRESS & PIN / B.S.** (clean stamp)

Two tins show: **PRESS & PIN / B.S.** (stamp doubled, as if struck twice)

One tin shows: **PRES S & PIN** (missing a letter) *(counterfeit suspected)*

### 3) Wick-twine stamping irregularity
Council Sheaf-Mark present on all spools—however:
- six spools show the mark on the *inside* of the paper wrap
- two spools show the mark in **green** ink (illegal; Council mark is black)

---

## ATTACHED RECEIPT (TORN)

*The bottom half of a receipt, ripped clean through the seller line.*

“Paid in advance. Buyer prefers ‘old clear’ from [REDACTED].  
Deliver late. Do not arrive by noon.  
If asked, say: **shore spoilage**.”

*(A smear of wax remains. The wax was once pressed with something round and ridged—like a coin, not a seal.)*

---

## WITNESS NOTES (UNOFFICIAL, DO NOT ARCHIVE)  
*(Someone archived them anyway.)*

**Rusk “Two-Reins” Mall (driver):**  
Says he received the tins from a “lantern boy” who wouldn’t step into sunlight.  
Claims the boy paid the toll with **buttons** and a grin.

**Ilda Fenwright (driver):**  
Says the cargo “sounded full” until it didn’t.  
Claims she heard a bell when they crossed the third mile-stone—  
then the bell stopped when she stopped looking.

**Watch hire (unnamed):**  
Refused statement. Took payment and left town at dawn.  
*(Clerk wrote: “coward.” Then scratched it out and wrote: “smart.”)*

---

## CLERK’S ACTIONS (OFFICIAL)

1) **Hold** sales of Item A until batch is tested by a sanctioned flame-priest.  
2) **Fine** Siltwake Cartage for altered count.  
3) **Request** the Council issue a travel-pass requirement for bulk oil shipments.  
4) **Confiscate** the warm river stone “for safety” and place in Council Shed #2.  
   *(Margin note: “Stone gone by morning. Shed lock intact.”)*

## MARGIN SCRAWLS (NOT PART OF THE RECORD)

- “Who stamps ink *inside* the wrap? Someone hiding the mark from buyers.”  
- “Green Council mark means a friendly clerk or a forged one.”  
- “Press & Pin stamp used without Brin’s hand? Ask him.”  
- “Buttons again. Always buttons.”  
- “If old clear burns sideways, what does it burn *toward*?”

*(At the very bottom, small handwriting like a confession:)*  
“**HF-TO-18-7B** filed under ‘oil’ because I don’t know what else to call it.”

---

## SEALS / MARKS (DESCRIBED)

**Trade Office Stamp:** a sheaf over crossed nails  
**Siltwake Cartage Mark:** three wavy lines under a wheel  
**Press & Pin Print Mark:** a thumbprint beside a small pin

*(One extra impression appears faintly on the back page: a ridged circle, like a coin pressed into wax.
It has no face, only teeth.)*
