# CHAPTER 30 — THE TAMER & THE COMPANION SYSTEM

Emberwild Game Bible v4.1

FULL REWRITE (Replaces all previous versions)

Aligned with your new creature tiers + no magic + realism + grounded world tone

This is now canon and matches Chapter 11 perfectly.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# CHAPTER 30 — THE TAMER & THE COMPANION SYSTEM

“The bond between hunter and beast is earned, not given.”

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.0 — PURPOSE

The Companion System is Emberwild’s realistic animal partnership framework.

It supports the Animal Tamer class, but ALSO governs:

- wild creature behavior
- capture methods
- training skill
- companion AI
- feeding/grooming
- injury & morale
- region-specific companion identity
- open-world utility roles

Normal → Rare → Elite → Rare Elite → Mini-Boss → Boss

Only the first four can ever be companions.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.1 — WHAT COUNTS AS A COMPANION

Only grounded, realistic creatures may become companions.

Eligible tiers:

- Normal
- Rare
- Elite
- Rare Elite

Mini-Bosses and Bosses cannot be companions.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.2 — TAMER CLASS ROLE IN COMPANION SYSTEM

The Animal Tamer class has:

- higher Companion Cap
- improved Morale regen
- improved Loyalty retention
- advanced training skills
- better harvesting from their own companion kills
- class-exclusive behaviors (track assist, flush prey, harass, pin, guard)

Non-Tamers:

- can have 1 basic companion
- limited behaviors
- limited control
- lower morale ceilings
- lower HP/DR scaling

Tamers:

- can have 2 active companions
- can maintain a stable (6–10 slots)
- have special commands
- gain synergy talents that enhance specific Families

This chapter defines the universal rules; the class chapter defines unique Tamer abilities.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.3 — CAPTURE SYSTEM (NO MAGIC, PURE SKILL)

Companions come from skillful capture, not spells or whistles.

There are two capture methods:

---

## 1. Snare Capture (Passive)

Used on:

- small mammals
- basic canines
- birds (ground-based)
- some reptiles

Requirements:

- crafted snare
- bait
- appropriate location
- tracking knowledge

Outcome:

- creature is caught → frightened → subdue → stabilize → bond stage begins

---

## 2. Subdue Capture (Active)

Used on larger creatures (boars, wolves, cats, raptors).

Flow:

1. Fight until threshold (creature weakened but NOT killed)
2. Subdue attempt (Tamer or player uses Subdue skill)
3. Creature collapses into “Pinned” state
4. Stabilize (stop bleeding, bind limbs, calm)
5. Begin bonding

This is skill-based, not RNG.

Weakening too much kills the creature.

Weakening too little = capture fails.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.4 — THE BONDING PHASE

Bonding is a short process requiring:

- feeding
- grooming
- tending wounds
- resting safely

Bond strength is measured by Loyalty, a hidden stat until full bond.

Bonding length varies by tier:

| Tier | Bond Time |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | Short |
| Rare | Moderate |
| Elite | Moderate-Long |
| Rare Elite | Long |

Bonding is fail-proof if you tend to the creature properly.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.5 — COMPANION STATS & SCALING

Companion stats scale by:

### 1. Creature Family (Base Identity)

Boars: tanky bruisers

Cats: burst ambush

Wolves: DPS and pack synergy

Birds of prey: tracking and bleed

Raptors: flanking and shred

Bears: high HP, low speed

etc.

### 2. TIER

| Tier | Stat Multiplier |

| Normal | 1.0× |

| Rare | 1.1× |

| Elite | 1.25× |

| Rare Elite | 1.4× |

### 3. COMPANION LEVEL

Companions level slowly from:

- kill participation
- survival
- feeding quality

### 4. TAMER TALENTS

Tamer talents provide:

- HP boosts
- damage boosts
- threat control
- flanking AI upgrades
- loyalty caps
- tracking synergy

This maintains realism while giving meaningful depth.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.6 — COMPANION MORALE

Morale determines:

- obedience
- aggression level
- stamina recovery
- performance under duress
- whether the companion flees or stands ground

Factors that raise morale:

- feeding
- grooming
- resting at camp
- successful hunts
- staying healthy
- high loyalty

Factors that lower morale:

- starvation
- excessive damage
- being left to bleed
- losing repeatedly
- low loyalty
- forced travel while injured

Companions can panic or flee if morale collapses.

Tamers have talents to stabilize morale instantly.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.7 — INJURY, WOUNDS, & VETERINARY CARE

Companions do not magically regenerate.

This is grounded, RDR2-style animal care.

### Wound Types:

- Bruising
- Lacerations
- Punctures
- Broken limbs (rare on normal hits, common vs mini-bosses)

### Treatment:

- bandages
- poultices
- stitched wounds
- splints
- rest

A companion that isn’t treated:

- loses max morale
- loses stat effectiveness
- risks permanent injury (rare)
- refuses to obey advanced commands

This deepens survival realism.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.8 — COMPANION BEHAVIOR MODES

These are universal modes available to ALL companions.

### 1. GUARD

Protects the player, reacts to threats, holds ground.

### 2. HARASS

Light, fast pressure to disrupt enemy AI.

### 3. MAUL / FANG / CLAW (Family Specific)

High-aggression mode; uses the creature’s natural attack type.

### 4. FLANK

Attempts to get behind or to the sides of enemies.

### 5. TRACK ASSIST

Helps locate clues, finds trails, or alerts you to nearby signs.

### 6. FETCH / RETRIEVE

For birds, canines, or certain trained animals.

### 7. HOLD

Stops movement entirely until released.

### 8. HEEL

Return to the player and stay close.

Tamers unlock advanced versions of these modes (better AI).

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.9 — COMPANION FAMILY ROLES (Identity Summary)

Every family follows Chapter 11 but has specific Companion identity rules.

Examples:

### Wolves

- best flanking AI in the game
- pack synergy
- high morale ceiling

### Boars

- tankiest
- best stagger resistance
- strong charge interrupts

### Cats (Large Felines)

- best ambushers
- highest burst
- lowest morale

### Raptors

- best bleeds
- aggressive chase behavior

### Bears

- highest HP
- slowest travel speed
- best for new players

### Birds of Prey

- exceptional tracking assist
- situational harassment

Tamers can specialize through talents.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.10 — COMPANION EQUIPMENT

No armor sets.

No fantasy barding.

No unrealistic saddles.

Equipment is grounded:

- tracking collars
- scent-masking wraps
- padded barding (light)
- paw protectors
- harnesses
- signal whistles
- utility packs (small)

This system is intentionally simple.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.11 — COMPANION PROGRESSION

Companions gain:

### A. Loyalty

(affects obedience)

### B. Discipline

(reduces AI mistakes)

### C. Fortitude

(stagger/bleed resist)

### D. Experience Levels

(HP, damage, resist scaling)

### E. Bond Traits

Unique perks earned from:

- hunting certain families
- surviving wounds
- defeating Rare Elite creatures
- traveling long distances
- saving player’s life

These traits are flavorful and grounded (no magic traits).

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.12 — STABLES & STORAGE

Only Tamers maintain a full stable.

Stable features:

- recovery beds
- grooming stations
- feed storage
- training posts
- recordkeeping (creature history)

Players can rotate companions but only one active (two for Tamers).

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.13 — COMPANION DEATH

Death is permanent unless:

- stabilized before bleeding out
- treated quickly
- carried back to camp
- revived within a realistic window (minutes, not magical resurrection)

This enforces:

- respect for wildlife
- realistic stakes
- grounded danger

Tamers have abilities to stabilize bleeding more efficiently.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.14 — WHAT COMPANIONS DO NOT DO

To keep the realism intact:

- no magical abilities
- no elemental damage
- no spirit-realm powers
- no teleporting to the player
- no carrying unrealistic loads
- no MMO “pet skills” or “spell buttons”
- no unnatural healing
- no flying mounts
- no supernatural buffs

Everything stays grounded.

────────────────────────

────────────────────────

# SECTION 30.15 — DESIGN INTENT

The Companion System should feel like:

- RDR2 animal bonding
- Classic WoW hunter pet depth
- grounded, slow, meaningful care
- tracking + hunting synergy
- an emotional connection
- part of survival, not a gimmick

A companion is:

a living animal, not a spell or tool.
