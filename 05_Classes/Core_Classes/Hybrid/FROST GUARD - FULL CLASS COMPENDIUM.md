# FROST GUARD — FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

# SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

## 1.1 CLASS FANTASY

The Frost Guard is Emberwild’s heavy-armored cold-forged defender — not a spellcaster, not a cryomancer, but a warrior trained in brutal cold endurance.

Cold exposure, breathing discipline, muscle conditioning, and an ability to exploit how cold affects joints, armor, and movement define their combat style.

They use:

- heavy plate armor
- tower shields
- war-hammers, axes, and polearms
- slow pressure, environmental conditioning
- brittle-window control

No spells.

No magical frost.

Just real-world cold training weaponized.

Identity Pillars:

- Endurance > Aggression
- Control > Burst
- Timing > Mobility
- Resolve > Fear
- Environment > Magic

Where they excel:

- Control tanking
- Slow stacking
- Brittle window exploitation
- Multi-target control
- High mitigation
- Long fights / cold biomes

Where they struggle:

- Mobility
- Casters
- Fast skirmishers
- DPS races
- Ranged pressure

The Frost Guard is the control tank, distinct from:

- Highlander (pure mitigation tank)
- Mercenary (bruiser/off-tank)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

Primary Role: Heavy-Armor Control Tank

Secondary Role: Brittle finisher / Slow master

Combat Profile:

- Very low mobility
- Strongest slow kit in the game
- Heavy Resolve windows
- Low DPS
- Nearly unkillable vs physical enemies
- Extremely strong elite control

Damage Shape:

- Slow, heavy swings
- Physical cold-pressure DoTs
- Brittle windows → high ally damage
- Minimal crit
- High armor scaling

Weaknesses:

- Poor damage
- Weak to casters
- Must maintain stance discipline
- Requires careful resource rhythm

## 1.6 EXPLORATION & WORLD UTILITY

Frost Guards excel at:

- Cold survival
- Blizzard traversal
- Ice structure breaking
- Climbing icy surfaces
- Pushing through storms

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# SECTION 6 — PASSIVE SYSTEMS (GLOBAL CLASS PASSIVES)

The Frost Guard carries multiple passive systems that reinforce:

- cold endurance
- control tanking
- slow mastery
- brittling windows
- heavy armor dominance

These are ALWAYS ON unless otherwise stated.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6.1 — Cold Conditioning (Class Passive)

Long-term cold exposure training grants:

- +10% resistance to all slow effects
- +6% reduced damage from “environmental cold” hazards
- –10% Vitality drain while in cold biomes
- +10% Resolve regen when standing still

Grounded, physical, realistic — NOT magical frost resistance.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6.2 — Plate-Bound Endurance

While wearing full Plate (all 5 armor slots):

- +3% armor effectiveness (multiplicative)
- +2% reduced stagger duration
- +1% Brittle application chance

This is the Frost Guard’s “armor identity” passive.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6.3 — Unmoving Stance

If the Frost Guard has not moved for 3 seconds:

- +4% Block Chance
- +6% Block Value

Loss of movement instantly removes these bonuses.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6.4 — Cold Breath Pressure

While blocking or bracing, enemies within 3m are considered under passive cold pressure:

- Applies micro-Chill (does NOT stack regular Chill)
- Slightly reduces enemy stamina regen
- Creates an “icy zone” identity without magic

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6.5 — Brittle Awareness

When a Brittle target is within 10m:

- The Frost Guard gains +3% crit chance (physical precision bonus)
- Shatter Strike cooldown reduced by 1 sec
- Threat generation increased by 5%

This rewards the player for controlling brittling windows.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# SECTION 7 — VISUAL / AUDIO / ANIMATION IDENTITY

No fantasy spells.

No ice magic.

Everything grounded, realistic, physical.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 7.1 — Visual Style

Frost Guard visuals emphasize:

- Thick, cold-forged steel plates
- Heavy furs layered for insulation
- Slow, purposeful posture
- Steam breath in cold weather
- Frost accumulation on armor edges
- Slow cracks in the ground from heavy swings (not magical — just impact force)
- Shields frost over slightly during block animations
- Brittle windows show hairline cracks on enemy armor/weapons (no magical glow)
- Frostbite pressure shows stiffened movements, slower steps

Everything is physical cold, not spell effects.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 7.2 — Animation Identity

Animations are:

- Heavy and weighted (long recovery frames)
- Low stance with grounded footwork
- Shield bracing with visible strain
- Cold Endurance shows a deep inhalation, fogging breath
- Shatter Strike: wide overhead smash with body torque
- Glacial Break: slow wind-up → brutal impact → stagger physics

The class should feel slow, immovable, iron-bodied.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 7.3 — Audio Identity

Audio cues emphasize:

- deep metallic impact
- shield rumble
- heavy armor creaking
- cold wind whistling when abilities slow targets
- enemy bones/armor cracking on brittle windows
- chest-resonance breathing during Resolve abilities

Everything must feel industrial, brutal, cold — never magical.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# SECTION 8 — ROLE SUMMARY AT LEVEL 60

Here is the Frost Guard’s final identity at max level.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 8.1 — Primary Role: Control Tank

Frost Guard is the best slow and brittle tank in Emberwild.

Strengths:

- unmatched slow chaining
- strongest Brittle uptime
- exceptionally long defensive windows
- top-tier AoE control
- highest mitigation VS physical after Highlander
- predictable, stable tanking

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 8.2 — Secondary Role: Debuffer / Zone Controller

Frost Guard provides:

- area suppression via Frostline Aura
- multi-target slow stacking
- armor vulnerability windows through brittle
- huge benefit to melee DPS classes via Shatter + Brittle

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 8.3 — Damage Profile

Damage is intentionally low:

- slow heavy strikes
- high modifiers only during Brittle
- simple rotation
- threat comes from control, not raw numbers

This matches Classic WoW Warrior Prot + WotLK DK tank pacing without magic.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 8.4 — Group Performance Summary

In dungeons:

- extremely stable tank
- simple to heal
- trivializes many melee enemies
- weaker against caster mobs

In raids:

- excels on slowable bosses
- struggles against high-mobility bosses
- provides top-tier debuff windows for group burst

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 8.5 — Solo Play

Solo performance is:

- slow but safe
- low damage
- high control
- nearly impossible to kill

Great for players who like “big, slow, unstoppable wall” fantasy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# SECTION 9 — ENDGAME BUILDS (LEVEL 60)

All builds follow:

40 points in main tree + 14 in off-tree

…or full hybrid.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# BUILD A — IMMUTABLE WALL (40 Aegis / 14 Herald)

Role: Dungeon Main Tank, Max Mitigation

### Highlights:

- biggest DR windows
- enormous block value
- Resolve Guard machine
- slows keep mobs glued
- extremely low healing required

### Weakness:

- lowest DPS of all tank builds

This is the “true tank” version.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# BUILD B — SHATTER TANK (40 Icebreaker / 14 Aegis)

Role: Damage-focused tank / elite hunter

### Highlights:

- strong burst during Brittle
- big Icebreaker spikes
- best solo tank build
- can contribute decent DPS

### Weakness:

- less stable than Aegis build
- requires timing

This is the Frost Guard’s aggressive variant.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# BUILD C — FROST AURA CONTROLLER (40 Herald / 14 Aegis)

Role: AoE slow tank, control specialist

### Highlights:

- insane aura radius
- huge slows
- battlefield lockdown
- nearly unkiteable

Great for handling groups, invasions, or waves.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# BUILD D — BALANCED HYBRID (23 Icebreaker / 23 Aegis / 8 Herald)

Role: All-purpose solo build

### Highlights:

- good mitigation
- good slows
- good brittle uptime
- simple, steady rotation

### Weakness:
