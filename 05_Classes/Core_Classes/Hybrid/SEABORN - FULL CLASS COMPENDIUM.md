# SEABORN — FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

# SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

## 1.1 CLASS FANTASY

The Seaborn is Emberwild’s coastal duelist, raider, and swift close-quarters fighter.

Born from reef villages, merchant docks, longshore crews, and shipboard combat traditions, the Seaborn fights with:

- fast blades
- harpoons and polearms
- boarding axes
- thrown knives and javelins
- agile footwork and stamina discipline

Where the Pirate is reckless aggression and brute force, the Seaborn is disciplined technique and tempo control.

Where the Hunter fights from range, the Seaborn wins by controlling distance at melee and short-throw range.

Where the Highlander stands like a wall, the Seaborn flows around blows, conserving Vitality and answering with fast counter-hits.

### Identity Pillars

- Technique over brute force
- Tempo over attrition
- Stamina discipline over rage
- Precision over chaos
- Mobility, but not unrealistic acrobatics

The Seaborn thrives in:

- coastline fights
- docks, piers, boarding planks
- forests and plains (mobile dueling)
- tight spaces where footwork and timing beat armor

He struggles in:

- heavy armor engagements
- magic-dominant environments
- prolonged attrition against tanks

This is a light-armor, high-skill melee hybrid.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

### Primary Role

- Melee DPS / Duelist

### Secondary Role

- Short-range skirmish / thrown utility

### Combat Profile

- High attack speed
- Strong opener pressure
- Reliable counter-attacks and reaction abilities
- Solid mobility (realistic sprint bursts, evasive footwork)
- Good sustained DPS with correct tempo
- Bleeds, wound pressure, armor-shred effects
- Short-range thrown options (up to 10–15m)

### Weaknesses

- Light armor only (Cloth → Leather)
- Limited defensive cooldowns
- No magic resist
- No ranged sustain
- Requires positional discipline
- Suffers when kited at long range

This is the closest class to a Classic Rogue, but:

- no stealth baseline
- no magic
- broader weapons
- more naval boarding flavor
- more stamina-driven tempo

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES (FINAL)

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.4 RESOURCE — VITALITY (PRIMARY & ONLY)

The Seaborn uses Vitality exclusively:

### Vitality Powers:

- Strikes
- Counters
- Evasive maneuvers
- Bleeds & pressure attacks
- Thrown tools

### Vitality Regeneration

- High out-of-combat
- Moderate in-combat
- Penalties when exhausted by repeated heavy abilities
- Bonuses from tempo talents

### Why no Rage, Focus, or Current?

Because Seaborn is the cleanest grounded fighter:

- not magical
- not spiritual
- not berserker
- not a ranged class

Pure Classic-style melee resource.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.5 EXPLORATION & WORLD UTILITY

Seaborn excel at:

- moving through coastal shallows
- climbing rigging, ropes, small ledges (not physics nonsense—just faster climb speeds)
- spotting fishing paths, tide marks
- identifying structural weaknesses in wooden environments
- reading tracks in sand, mud, or wet stone

Exploration Bonuses:

- Reduced movement penalties in shallow water
- Faster climb speed on ropes, vines, ladders
- Slight fall damage reduction (seaman training)
- Bonus stamina regen outdoors

NO magical tracking, NO supernatural sensing.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.6 GROUP ROLE

In dungeons, Seaborn provide:

- strong melee DPS
- wound pressure
- interrupts (kick, pommel bash)
- target swap efficiency
- short-range thrown pulls
- control options (hamstring-style slows, disarms)

Weaknesses:

- squishy
- limited AoE
- must manage Vitality
- no big defensive cooldowns like Highlander

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1.7 DAMAGE PROFILE & SCALING

### Damage Sources

1. Light melee auto-attacks (fast weapons)
2. Special strikes (Vitality-based)
3. Bleed effects (physical DoTs)
4. Counter-attacks (reactive tempo abilities)
5. Thrown knives/javelins (short-range utility)
6. Burst windows from stances

### Scaling

- Agility (primary)
- Attack Power
- Weapon Skill
- Crit
- Haste (minor)
- Armor Penetration (late-game)

### Damage Shape

- Fast hits
- Steady sustained DPS
- Bleed consistency
- High opener burst
- Strong dueling power
- Limited AoE

────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS & CLASS SYSTEMS

## 2.0 OVERVIEW

The Seaborn’s internal engine is made of:

1. Tempo System — basic → advanced → exhaustion states
2. Counter-Attack Mechanics — reactions to enemy swings
3. Bleed & Wound Pressure — physical DoTs and armor breaks
4. Footwork System — stance-based bonuses
5. Thrown Weapon Utility — short-range tools
6. Vitality Economy — stamina-like resource management

The class is simple on paper, hard to master.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1 TEMPO SYSTEM

Tempo = the rhythm of attacks.

The Seaborn has 3 states:

### Neutral Tempo

- Baseline damage
- Normal Vitality regen
- Standard attack speed

### Advancing Tempo

Triggered by:

- Landing 3 consecutive weapon hits
- Using a stance ability
- Successfully countering an enemy attack

Effects:

- +X% attack speed for 6 sec
- +small Vitality regen
- Enables certain abilities (e.g., Finisher Strikes)

### Exhausted Tempo

Triggered by:

- Using a heavy finisher
- Taking high burst damage
- Running out of Vitality

Effects:

- X% attack speed for 4 sec
- Reduced damage
- Reduced regen

This system is realistic, simple, and entirely physical.

No magic.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.2 COUNTER-ATTACK SYSTEM

Seaborn excel in timing-based reactions.

### Counter-Attack Triggers

- Successfully dodge an attack
- Parry (based on weapon skill + Agility)
- Interrupt an ability
- Riposte after stance use

### Counter-Attack Benefits

- Free or reduced-cost follow-up
- Bonus crit chance
- Armor penetration
- Tempo advancement

This makes Seaborn a skill-based melee class without RNG gimmicks.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.3 BLEED & WOUND PRESSURE

Seaborn specialize in:

- cuts
- cripples
- tendon hits
- shallow-but-effective bleeds

Bleeds scale with:

- Agility
- AP
- Weapon DPS
- Rank

Bleeds DO NOT stack infinitely — 2–3 max depending on ability.

Wound Pressure = small armor reduction or periodic internal damage.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.4 FOOTWORK SYSTEM (STANCE ENGINE)

Seaborn use stances, but not magical auras.

They are physical postures:

- Duelist’s Guard — defensive, reactive
- Breaker’s Advance — offensive, armor-shred
- Fleet Stance — mobility and bleed advantage

Only one stance active at a time.

Stances cost no upkeep but cost Vitality to switch.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.5 THROWN WEAPON UTILITY

Short-range only (10–15m):

- Opening pulls
- Interrupts
- Armor-shred javelins
- Bleed knives
- Execute-range throws

Thrown tools cost Vitality, NOT ammo.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.6 VITALITY ECONOMY

Vitality is used for:

- Strikes
- Counters
- Stances
- Thrown attacks

Typical costs:

- Light strikes = 10–20
- Medium = 20–35
- Heavy finishers = 40–60
- Stance swap = 15–20
- Interrupts = 10–15

This economy enforces Classic pacing.

────────────────────────────────────────

Perfect — C (mixed 2–3 talents per tier) is the correct choice.

This lets us keep the class clean, Classic-WoW authentic, and mechanically tight, without forced bloat or forced minimalism.

I will now rewrite ALL THREE Seaborn talent trees from the ground up:

- Duelist (single-target, stance mastery, counter-attacks)
- Raider (cleave, mobility, thrown weapons, skirmish pressure)
- Reaver (bleeds, finishers, tempo dominance)

Each tier will have 2 or 3 talents, whichever makes the most sense mechanically, thematically, and for long-term balance under Combat Patch 1.0.

Capstones = Tier 9 = 1 talent (as always).

Everything will be clean, AAA, detailed, and balanced — no random abilities, no magical bullshit, no drift.
