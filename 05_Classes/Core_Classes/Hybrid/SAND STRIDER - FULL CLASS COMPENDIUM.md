# SAND STRIDER — FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

## SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

### 1.1 CLASS FANTASY — THE DUNE PREDATOR

The Sand Strider is Emberwild’s ambush-duelist:

a light-armored survivalist who hunts across dunes, burrows beneath the battlefield, and punishes enemies with precise, venom-infused cuts.

Not a rogue.

Not a monk.

Not a barbarian.

A Sand Strider is defined by:

- movement mastery
- terrain exploitation
- precise bleeds and poisons
- burrow-based repositioning
- sand manipulation and evasion
- momentum over brute force

Visual fantasy:

- sand veils flickering across the ground
- sudden eruptions from below
- slashing attacks that leave thin red lines
- drifting sand trails behind movements
- desert-style wraps, sashes, and curved blades
- fluid movements with constant directional shifts

Identity pillars:

- precision over power
- ambush over attrition
- terrain over stat brute-force
- venom over raw damage
- repositioning over trading blows

Where the Sand Strider excels:

- 1v1 duels
- assassinating or isolating dangerous targets
- controlling movement tempo
- shredding foes with bleed/poison stacking
- ambushing in tight spaces
- repositioning faster than any melee class
- avoiding burst damage through evasion tools

Where the Sand Strider struggles:

- against heavily armored tanks
- sustained long fights without resetting
- against high-mobility ranged kiting classes
- heavy AoE spellcasters
- cramped spaces where burrow paths are limited

The Sand Strider is Emberwild’s desert ambusher —

deadliest when controlling space, punishing missteps, and dictating movement tempo.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

Primary Role:

Ambush DPS / Bleed-Poison Duelist

Secondary Role:

Reposition Specialist / Soft Control / Evasion-Survivor

Combat profile:

- rapid direction changes
- controlled stamina usage
- bleeds + poisons forming a damage engine
- high payoff after perfect movement
- short, lethal burst windows after burrow emerges
- terrain-dependent toolkit
- sand veils for evasive micro-survival
- strong soft-CC (blinds, slows, sand ripple)
- no direct heavy nukes like Hunter / Witch

Weaknesses:

- poor into armor (Highlander, Frost Guard)
- relies on consistent repositioning
- low AoE throughput
- punishable during mispositioned dives
- dependent on Venom Flow sequencing

Combat rewards:

- spacing
- positional mastery
- timing burrow emerges
- chaining bleeds + poisons
- stamina rhythm
- counter-movement
- punishing dodge-bait windows

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES

Armor:

- Light armor only (cloth → leather progression)

Sand Striders depend on mobility, not armor rating.

Allowed Weapon Types

Primary:

- Daggers
- Shortswords
- Curved blades (scimitars, khopesh-style)

Secondary:

- Thrown knives
- Short spears
- Hand-crossbows (utility ranged implements only)

Off-Hand:

- Light straps / bucklers (evasion-focused)
- Poison vials
- Venom pouches

Forbidden Weapon Categories

- Two-handed weapons (greatswords, greataxes, mauls)
- Maces / hammers
- Greatbows / full crossbows
- Guns
- Heavy shields
- Medium/heavy armor

Weapon identity:

fast, fluid, precise, built around puncture, bleed, and poison interaction.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.4 RESOURCE — STAMINA & VENOM FLOW

The Sand Strider operates on a dual-resource model:

### Stamina

- fuels movement, dodges, rolls
- fuels Burrow Dive and Sand Veil
- regenerates quickly out of combat
- regenerates slowly in combat

Stamina is the class’s defensive economy.

### Venom Flow

- a pseudo-resource built from bleeds/poisons
- fuels finishers and high-tier venom effects
- does not have a strict hard cap
- organizes itself into Venom Tiers
- higher tiers = faster tick rate + stronger finishers

Venom Flow is the offensive engine.

It rewards perfect tracking, uptime, and movement tempo.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.5 EXPLORATION & ENVIRONMENT SPECIALIZATION

Sand Strider excels in:

- dunes
- deserts
- canyons
- soft soil / sand paths
- caravan routes
- ruins partially buried in sand
- predator nests
- oasis terrain

Exploration strengths:

- +movement speed in sand
- better stamina regen in desert areas
- can burrow through soft terrain to access shortcuts
- terrain-based stealth and ambush advantage
- environmental tracking bonuses on sand
- faster harvest of desert herbs & toxins

Exploration drawbacks:

- limited Burrow paths on stone / metal
- poor in full-water zones
- weaker in dense forests or jungles
- struggles on steep vertical cliffs

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.6 GROUP ROLE — DUNGEONS & PARTY PLAY

A Sand Strider brings:

- elite target isolation
- strong finishing power
- slows, blinds, and micro-controls
- reposition windows to pull mobs apart
- emergency peel tools via blinds & slows
- utility through stamina pressure on enemies
- reliable execute in boss phases

Weaknesses in groups:

- low AoE damage
- heavily single-target oriented
- cannot front-line
- dependent on teammates not dragging mobs away
- needs space to maneuver

The Strider is a surgical melee DPS, not a cleaver or front-line bruiser.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.7 DAMAGE PROFILE & SCALING

Damage sources:

1. Bleeds
2. Poisons
3. Burrow emerges (Emerge Puncture)
4. Positional strikes (flank/back)
5. Venom finishers (Venom Crush, Venom Burst, Dune Execution)
6. Sand Veil / blind setups
7. Movement-enhanced attacks

Primary scaling stats:

- Agility
- Weapon Damage
- Bleed Scaling
- Poison Potency
- Critical Strike Chance
- Stamina Regeneration

Damage shape:

- weak opener
- ramps quickly as bleeds and poisons stack
- poison spikes at mid-tier Venom Flow
- strongest after Burrow emerges + blind/slow setups
- no long-cooldown nukes; relies on continuous engine loops

────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────

## SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS & BURROW / VENOM ENGINES

The Sand Strider is governed by three interconnected engines:

1. Venom Engine — Bleeds & Poisons + Flow Tiers
2. Burrow Engine — Dive → Reposition → Emerge Strike
3. Sand Veil Engine — Evasion → Blind → Reset Window

Everything the class does revolves around synchronizing these three.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.0 MECHANICAL OVERVIEW

Strider combat is:

- positional
- movement-driven
- tempo-controlled
- bleed/poison-layered
- stamina-paced

Unlike burst classes (Hunter, Witch), Strider damage ramps rather than spiking instantly.

Core loop:

1. Open with mobility → apply bleed.
2. Layer poison → build Venom Flow.
3. Burrow → reposition.
4. Emerge → heavy bleed modifier.
5. Blind or slow → secure uptime.
6. Spend Venom Flow on finisher.

The class is strongest when:

- the Strider maintains constant movement
- burrow emerges align with bleed/poison windows
- Venom Flow reaches Tier 2–3 consistently
- Sand Veil is used reactively, not spammed

Weak when:

- forced into straight trading
- chased by long-range kiting classes
- locked into bad terrain
- stamina is pressured

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.1 VENOM ENGINE (BLEEDS + POISONS + FLOW TIERS)

Venom Flow Generation

+1 Flow:

- bleed tick
- poison tick
- Quick Cut hit
- any hit vs slowed or blinded enemy

+2–4 Flow:

- application of a new bleed
- application of a new poison
- Twin Slash second hit

+6–8 Flow:

- Emerge Puncture
- Snakebite
- Dustlash per target (max +12 Flow per cast)

Flow Decay Rules

Out of combat:

- –4 Flow every 3 seconds

In combat (no DoT activity):

- –6 Flow every 8 seconds
- moving 3+ meters delays next decay tick by +1s
- Sand Veil delays decay by +2s

Flow has no hard numeric cap; tiers determine bonuses.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.2 VENOM TIERS

Tier 0 (0–19 Flow) — Minor Venoms

- basic bleed/poison behavior
- no special bonuses

Tier 1 (20–39 Flow) — Active Venoms

- bleed tick speed +10%
- poison potency +10%
- small poison impact burst on application

Tier 2 (40–69 Flow) — Lethal Rhythm

- bleed tick speed +20%
- poison potency +20%
- finishers deal +15% more damage
- Emerge Puncture applies additional bleed

Tier 3 (70+ Flow) — Predator’s Sting

- bleed tick speed +35%
- poison potency +35%
- flanking strikes grant +10 Flow
- poison tick interval reduced by 0.2s
- decay slowed by 30%

AI treats Tier 3 as a high-danger state.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.3 BURROW ENGINE (DIVE → POSITION → EMERGE STRIKE)

Valid Burrow Terrain

- sand
- soft soil
- dust
- light gravel

Cannot burrow on:

- stone / rock
- metal floors
- deep water
- spirit-only zones
- rune-protected floors

Burrow Dive Behavior

- stamina cost: 30
- 0.2s delay before dive
- partial untargetability (frontal melee cannot hit)
- 50% reduced AoE damage taken
- controlled by player direction input

Emergence Behavior (Emerge Puncture)

On emerging:

- triggers Emerge Puncture (strike + bleed)
- applies 0.25s flinch
- bonus damage from rear/flank
- grants temporary evasion (10% dodge for 1s)
- generates 6–8 Venom Flow (rank-based)
- resets auto-attack sequence

Distance Scaling

| Distance traveled | Emerge damage bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 0–4m | +0% |
| 5–8m | +6% |
| 9–12m | +12% (cap) |

AI Reactions to Burrow

- melee enemies step back and try to sidestep
- ranged enemies kite diagonally and fire at predicted emergence
- elites place ground hazards along likely burrow paths

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.4 SAND VEIL ENGINE (EVASION → BLIND → REPOSITION)

Base Sand Veil Behavior

- cost: ~22 stamina (modified by talents)
- 12s base cooldown (modified by talents)
- 0.2–0.6s blind (rank/talent scaling)
- +12–20% dodge chance for ~2s (rank scaling)
- breaks soft slows
- reduces ranged hit chance
- delays Venom Flow decay

Blind is short and non-stacking. It:

- interrupts casts
- causes heavy miss chance
- creates a punish window

Sand Veil is a micro-reset, not vanish.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.5 BLEED & POISON INTERACTION RULESET

Bleeds

- apply instantly
- tick every 2s baseline
- scale with Agility + Weapon Damage
- tick speed affected by Venom Tier
- refreshed bleeds extend duration by +1s

Poisons

- apply on hit
- tick every 1.8s baseline
- scale with Poison Potency
- generate more Flow than bleeds
- gain small impact bursts at Tier 1+

Combo State (Bleed + Poison on same target)

- Strider deals +6% increased damage to that target
- Sand Veil blinds vs that target extend by +0.1s
- slows against that target are +10% stronger
- Emerge Puncture against that target gains +15% damage

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.6 STAMINA ENGINE (MOVEMENT → DODGE → BURROW)

Stamina governs:

- dodges and rolls
- Sand Veil
- Burrow Dive
- sprint bursts

Baseline regen:

- +4 per second out of combat
- +2 per second in combat

Bonus stamina gains:

- dodging attacks
- hitting slowed or blinded targets
- landing flanking hits

Running out of stamina:

- prevents burrow, dashes, and Sand Veil
- collapses the class’s defensive identity

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.7 CONTROL MECHANICS (BLINDS, SLOWS, RIPPLE)

Sand Strider uses soft control only:

- Blinds (0.1–1.0s)
- Slows (20–35%)
- Flinch (0.25s)
- Sand Ripple slow zones

Purpose:

- disrupt casting rhythm
- punish sloppy positioning
- weaken enemy bursts
- create offensive windows
- open flanking opportunities

No hard stuns, roots, or long silences.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.8 AI INTERACTION (STRIDER AS ENEMY / ALLY)

Enemy Sand Striders (NPC):

- only burrow on valid terrain
- prefer flank emerges
- use Sand Ripple at choke points
- avoid frontal trades
- pop Sand Veil before big hits

Allied Sand Striders (NPC):

- avoid pulling off tanks
- position at flanks, not front
- stagger Sand Ripples instead of stacking
- use Sand Veil defensively
- sync finishers with tank stuns/slows

────────────────────────────────────────

### 2.9 MOMENTUM WINDOWS

Three engine-level power windows:

1. Burrow → Emerge Window (primary burst, ~1.8s)
2. Blind → Flank Window (brief punish state)
3. Venom Tier 3 Window (sustained DPS state until Flow < 70)

When all three align, peak single-target DPS can briefly reach ~22–24% above Priest baseline after the micro-nerf, then drops back into sustained ramp.

## SECTION 6 — CLASS SYSTEMS & AI INTERACTION

Sand Strider — Venom Engine / Burrow Engine / Sand Veil Engine / Flow System

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Sand Strider combat is defined by four internal engines:

1. Flow Engine — momentum-based combat rhythm (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3).
2. Venom Engine — dual-DoT system (bleed + poison) with stacking interaction rules.
3. Burrow Engine — ambush mobility, emerge bonuses, flanking power.
4. Sand Veil Engine — dodge, blind, DR, control, misdirection.

Sand Strider damage = DoT management + flanks + emerge windows + dodge uptime.

Everything is built around constant movement, positional advantage, and status layering.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 FLOW ENGINE — MOMENTUM & COMBO RESOURCE

Flow = class momentum resource (0 → 100).

Flow Tiers:

- 0–33 = Tier 1
- 34–66 = Tier 2
- 67–100 = Tier 3

Flow Generation Sources

- hitting a bleeding target: +3
- hitting a poisoned target: +3
- applying a bleed or poison: +5
- using Sand Veil: +8
- flanking: +5
- emerging from burrow: +6
- dodging an attack: +3
- critting a DoT tick: +2 (1s ICD)

Flow Decay

- out of combat: –5 every 4s
- in combat, not attacking: –5 every 6s
- after Sand Veil: decay paused 2s
- after emerging: decay paused 2s

Flow Breakpoints

- Tier 1 → basic rotation stable
- Tier 2 → +6% attack speed, +5% DoT tick speed
- Tier 3 → +12% attack speed, +15% DoT tick speed, +10% finisher damage

Flow is a non-spending system; it creates momentum rather than acting as a mana dump.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 VENOM ENGINE — BLEED / POISON SYSTEM

Sand Strider uses two parallel DoT types:

1. Bleeds (physical DoT)
2. Poisons (nature DoT)

DoT Rules

- You can maintain multiple bleeds + multiple poisons on one enemy.
- Bleeds & Poisons scale separately with Flow Tier.
- Poisons benefit more from crit.
- Bleeds benefit more from flanking.
- When enemy has both, they enter Venom State.

Venom State Effects

When target has ≥1 bleed AND ≥1 poison:

- target takes +6% damage from Sand Strider
- finisher abilities deal +10% more
- bleed ticks +10%
- poison ticks +6%
- Flow generation +2 per tick (1s ICD)

Bleed Refresh Logic

- Bleeds may be refreshed without resetting max duration.
- Certain talents extend duration by 0.2–1.0s per hit.

Poison Stacking Logic

- Multiple poisons can overlap; strongest ticking poison is displayed.
- Secondary poisons contribute +25% of their damage to main poison tick.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 BURROW ENGINE — MOVEMENT, AMBUSH, EMERGE

Burrow functions as both mobility + damage window engine.

Burrow Rules

- Burrow Dive moves at 150% run speed underground.
- Cannot be hit by melee.
- Ranged/spells hit for 45% reduced damage.
- Burrow lasts up to 4s.
- Burrow cannot pass through solid objects.
- AI loses target lock for 0.5s during descent.

Emerge Rules

- emerging counts as flanking if coming from >90° angle
- Emerge Puncture always crits if:

– traveled ≥7m

– and Flow Tier 2+

- emerging pauses Flow decay for 2s
- first 2 abilities after emerging gain +5 Flow each

Blind/Slow Rules

Talents may add:

- 0.1–0.3s blind
- 15–45% slow
- 5–10% DR for 2s

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.4 SAND VEIL ENGINE — DODGE / BLIND / DR / CONTROL

Sand Veil = core survivability + control tool.

Sand Veil Core Rules

- 1.5s duration
- +35% dodge (base)
- –20% ranged damage taken
- blinds nearby enemies for 0.5s
- generates +8 Flow
- negates soft slows for 1.5s after ending
- interrupts enemy “aim time” if within 6m

Blind Rules

- blind duration 0.5–1.5s depending on talents
- blind causes:

– 100% miss chance on melee for 0.5s

– ranged accuracy –50%

– AI loses target for 0.3s

Veil Interaction Logic

Within 3s of Sand Veil:

- next 2 attacks generate +1–3 Flow
- bleeds deal +6% (Sandgrip talent)
- first hit deals +10–25% bonus

Sand Veil is the core defensive → offensive conversion tool.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.5 AI INTERACTION — SAND STRIDER AS ENEMY

Melee AI vs Sand Strider

- backs away during Sand Veil
- waits for blind to end
- uses gapclosers post-emerge
- avoids frontal approach if 2+ bleeds active
- attempts to interrupt poisons

Ranged AI vs Sand Strider

- kites backwards when poisoned
- uses burst only during Veil cooldown
- attempts to bait Sand Veil before big attacks
- targets Sand Strider during emerge recovery

Elite/Boss AI vs Sand Strider

- burrow detection: predicted re-emerge zones
- ignores first blind but adapts to second
- applies constant soft AoEs to punish burrow play
- rotates shield to block flank attempts

Overall: bosses make Sand Strider work for every punish window.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.6 AI INTERACTION — SAND STRIDER AS ALLY

Friendly AI behavior:

- stays OUT of Sand Veil blind radius
- keeps enemies grouped for bleeds
- avoids knocking enemies away during Venom State
- tanks face mobs so Strider can flank
- healers time heals after Veil ends

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.7 EDGE CASE LOGIC

If Sand Strider is Stunned

- bleeds/poisons continue
- Flow decays normally
- cannot burrow or veil

If Silenced

- bleeds/poisons unaffected
- burrow/veil still usable
- finishers still usable

If Rooted

- can Veil to break soft slows but NOT root
- can burrow but cannot move more than 1m

If Snared

- Sand Veil negates snare
- burrow reduces snare by 50%

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 POSITIONAL SYSTEM — FLANK & BACK ATTACKS

Flank (90° arc)

- +6% damage
- +3 Flow

Backstab (30° arc)

- +12% damage
- +5 Flow
- +4% crit

Emerging from burrow always counts as flank if not directly in front.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.9 COMBO WINDOWS

Sand Strider strongest window:

Emerge → Sand Veil → Venom Crush → Finisher → Dash → Re-engage

Within this sequence:

- enemies are slowed or blinded
- Flow spikes to Tier 3
- DoTs hit fastest
- finishers hit hardest
