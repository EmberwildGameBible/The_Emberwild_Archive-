# FARMER - FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

SEGMENT 1 — SECTION 1: CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY
CLASS: FARMER
Emberwild Design Document — Class Bible v2 (Balance-Pass Edition, Priest-Format)

⸻

SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

1.1 CLASS FANTASY — THE HANDS OF THE WORLD
The Farmer is Emberwild’s grounded preparation-and-sustain archetype:
a working tradesperson who turns land, soil, and hard-earned know-how into staying power, steady damage, and quiet protection.

Not a druid.
Not a shaman.
Not a cleric.
Not a mage.

A Farmer is a craftsman of conditions: they manipulate terrain, timing, and supplies rather than raw magic. They plant hazards, fortify ground, brace through impact, and outlast enemies with healing food, tinctures, field tools, and stubborn resilience.

Identity pillars
• preparation over panic
• terrain over mobility
• sustain over burst
• tools over spells
• patience over aggression
• campcraft over flash
• locality over universal power

Where the Farmer excels
• long fights and attrition
• outdoor encounters and natural terrain
• holding positions, choke points, or camps
• small-group sustain and support
• turning small mistakes into huge advantages (good bracing, good ground)
• solo durability and safe leveling
• cooking, field repairs, and supply-based buffs

Where the Farmer struggles
• fast, explosive burst fights
• highly mobile skirmishers
• teleport-heavy spirit encounters without preparation time
• tight indoor arenas with no time to set up
• very long-range engagements (archers, snipers)

The Farmer is not a heroic spellcaster.
They are Emberwild’s survivor-profession: the person who keeps everyone fed, alive, and standing through grit and practical craft.

⸻

1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY
Primary Role:
• Sustain / Support Hybrid (mid-line anchor)

Secondary Role:
• Control / Soft Mitigation / Safe Soloer

Combat profile
• moderate, honest weapon damage
• strong self-healing and regen
• positional buffs (standing near groundworks, gardens, or camp fixtures)
• brace windows to halve incoming danger
• damage over time through seeds, soil hazards, and treated tools
• simple, repeatable loops that reward patience

Weaknesses
• lowest burst in the game
• low mobility
• relies on terrain, placed tools, and timing
• must pre-plan fights for full impact
• weak snap-response to sudden adds or ganks

Combat rewards
• placing ground effects and camp fixtures early
• bracing at the right time
• keeping food buffs and tonics rolling
• choosing where to stand (and making enemies come to that spot)
• thinking like a survivalist, not like a duelist

⸻

1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES
Armor Progression
• Cloth → Leather → Chain
The Farmer wears practical working gear that slowly gains resilience via reinforced leather, chain underlays, and padded work clothing.

Armor identity
• not a plate tank
• relies on Vitality, brace, and terrain instead of raw armor value
• gains minor bonuses when wearing lighter, flexible work gear (better gathering, better placement speed)

Allowed Weapons
Primary
• Hoes, spades, and hand-pick tools (count as 1H maces)
• Work knives and hatchets (light 1H axes)
• Simple staves (walking sticks, tool-handles)

Off-Hand
• Tool satchels
• Seed pouches
• Lanterns
• Small bucklers (late-game only, as improvised shields)

Forbidden Weapons
• heavy warhammers
• greatswords
• polearms
• longbows, crossbows, firearms
• ornate magical implements

The Farmer fights with work tools, using whatever they already had in their cart.

⸻

1.4 RESOURCE — VITALITY & GRIT
Farmers operate on a dual-rhythm system:

Vitality
• core resource used for bracing, healing surges, and restorative skills
• regenerates over time, faster when well-fed or at camp
• interacts with food buffs (higher max Vitality, faster regen)
• fuels the “sustain” half of the class

Grit
• lightweight secondary meter that builds when:
– the Farmer takes hits while braced
– groundworks and hazards are tripped
– allies benefit from Farmer’s food and field tools
• spent or consumed by stronger field actions (big brace, big patching, wide-area fortification)
• never fully “dumped” like a burst resource; it’s slowly churned

Vitality = “how much you still have in the tank.”
Grit = “how stubbornly you keep going and protect others.”

⸻

1.5 EXPLORATION & ENVIRONMENT SPECIALIZATION
The Farmer is Emberwild’s environmental specialist.

Farmers excel in:
• fields, farms, and rolling plains
• forest edges and scrublands
• hill slopes and roadside clearings
• any outdoor space where they can stand their ground

Exploration strengths
• spotting forage, herbs, and wild crops
• finding better footing and “good ground” (micro defensive spots)
• establishing quick camps and waypoints
• patching gear and tending wounds away from town
• making bad terrain slightly less dangerous for allies

Exploration drawbacks
• minimal advantage in deep stone corridors or smooth, artificial floors
• natural tools are weaker in pure spirit zones
• struggles when constantly forced to move with no time to plant or set

Indoor / unnatural environment rule (retuned)
• Farmers lose a portion of their soil and ground-based bonuses indoors
• but gain compensation through better personal regen, longer brace, and a small group comfort aura (lantern/warmth logic)

⸻

1.6 GROUP ROLE — DUNGEONS & PARTY PLAY
In parties, Farmers provide:

- constant small healing and regen
• reliable DR windows via brace auras
• environmental soft control (slows, minor hazards, bad footing for enemies)
• food buffs and between-pull stabilizing tools
• emergency saves via big brace or patch-up abilities
• safe, predictable damage

They are not:
• the main tank
• the primary healer
• the top DPS

They are the anchor that makes risky pulls safe and sloppy play survivable.

Group weaknesses
• cannot hard-carry damage checks
• needs allies to play around their groundworks (standing in the right places)
• offers little in extremely mobile fights with constant displacement or leaps

⸻

1.7 DAMAGE PROFILE & SCALING
Damage Sources
1.	Work-tool weapon swings (baseline DPS)
2.	Soil hazards (thorns, caltrops, briars, slick mud)
3.	Simple damage-over-time from treated tools (oils, saps)
4.	Punishment from enemies standing in bad ground
5.	Occasional “harvest” burst when timing lines up (modest, not explosive)

Primary Scaling Stats
• Stamina (survivability, light DR, small regen boosts)
• Vitality (resource depth and sustain)
• Tool Mastery (internal scaling stat for Farmer’s weapon and hazard output)
• Modest Spell Power equivalent (for herbal poultices and treated soils only)

Damage Shape
• steady, never spiky
• low early-level burst, then stable mid-game plateau
• relies heavily on damage prevented and fights extended on your terms
• strongest in multi-target brawls where enemies stay in your prepared spaces
• weakest where everything dies or moves too fast for ground-based play to matter

⸻

SEGMENT 2 — SECTION 2: CORE MECHANICS & FARMER ENGINES

CLASS: FARMER

---

SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS

The Farmer’s gameplay is defined by three engines:

1. Brace Engine — short, timed defensive windows
2. Groundwork Engine — placed hazards, soil treatments, and terrain shaping
3. Campcraft Engine — food, tinctures, regen, and comfort auras

These interact with Vitality (core resource) and Grit (stubbornness meter).

---

2.0 — MECHANICAL OVERVIEW

Farmer combat is built on:

- choosing the ground
- bracing to halve incoming danger
- applying steady pressure through hazards
- healing over time through food and poultices
- using Grit for emergency stabilization
- punishing enemies who overextend into your prepared area

Unlike other classes, Farmer power depends on where they fight, not how fast they press buttons.

---

2.1 — BRACE ENGINE

Brace is the Farmer’s core survival mechanic.

Brace Rules:

- brief 2–3 sec window of −35% incoming damage
- faster Vitality regeneration during brace
- some attacks “glance” during brace, reducing impact
- grants Grit when absorbing hits
- cannot be spammed — 10 sec minimum downtime
- strengthened in indoor environments (compensation rule)

Brace Types

1. Basic Brace — early-level core defensive skill
2. Deep Brace — enhanced version with higher DR and Grit generation
3. Field Brace — affects both Farmer and nearby allies
4. Harvest Brace — adds modest retaliation damage

Brace Identity

- not a parry
- not a block
- not magical
- a practiced survival posture that makes you hard to knock down

---

2.2 — GROUNDWORK ENGINE

Groundworks are placed terrain effects that define Farmer combat.

Groundwork Types:

- Briarthorn Patch — small thorn damage & slow
- Mud Slick — movement reduction, footing penalty
- Sap Trap — sticky slowing snare
- Caltrop Scatter — repeated micro-puncture damage
- Bole Mound — defensive soil that reduces incoming damage
- Garden Circle — regenerative zone for self and allies
- Oil Spread — increases tool damage for a short time

Groundwork Rules:

- only 2 groundworks can be active at early levels
- improved to 3–4 with talent investment
- groundworks last 10–20 sec depending on type
- enemies inside suffer footing and accuracy penalties
- strongest in outdoor or semi-natural terrain
- reduced potency on flat stone or spirit surfaces (with indoor compensation buffs)

Ritual-Like Behavior

Groundworks fill a similar “battlefield area” role as Witch rituals, but built from craft rather than magic.

Placement time is short but not instant.

---

2.3 — CAMPCRAFT ENGINE

Campcraft is the Farmer’s sustain and support system.

Campcraft Actions:

- heal-over-time poultices
- Vitality regen boosts
- field meals (long-term food buffs)
- bandage-style emergency patching
- lantern comfort aura
- tinctures (minor stat bonuses or cleanses)

Food Rules:

- only one food buff active at a time
- lasts 15–30 minutes depending on quality
- provides max Vitality, regen, or resistance bonuses
- premium foods require ingredients from exploration

Poultice Rules:

- instant application (2 sec global action)
- heal over time
- cannot be stacked with other poultices
- increased effect when standing on natural soil

Tincture Rules:

- 30–90 sec buffs
- small bonuses to stamina, damage, DR, or regen
- some cleanse minor debuffs

Campcraft Identity

- low-cost, high-economy sustain
- not magical healing
- based on herbs, salves, soil, and rest principles
- supports entire party between pulls

---

2.4 — DAMAGE CONVERSION & HAZARD PRESSURE

Farmer has no burst buttons.

Damage is built through long fights and terrain control.

Hazard Interactions:

- movement in groundworks causes repeated micro-damage
- treated tools gain bonus damage for short windows
- hitting braced enemies increases retaliation from hazards
- some groundworks synergize (e.g., Mud Slick + Caltrops create double triggers)

Footing Penalty System:

Enemies inside Farmer groundworks suffer footing penalties:

- −10–18% accuracy
- reduced ability to crit
- increased chance of “stumble” (small delay on next attack)
- slight movement drag

These penalties add up in multi-enemy brawls.

---

2.5 — GRIT ENGINE

Grit = the Farmer’s resolve meter.

Grit Generation:

- taking hits during brace
- enemies triggering hazards
- healing allies with poultices
- using camp tools successfully
- surviving near-death moments (below 30% HP)

Grit Uses:

- emergency +50% brace amplification
- instant small heal
- rapid placement of a groundwork
- “Harvest Moment” — short damage spike

Grit never dumps to zero like a rage bar – it churns between 0–100 with slower decay.

---

2.6 — INDOOR COMPENSATION ENGINE

Because so much of Farmer power relies on soil and outdoor terrain:

Indoors (tuned rule):

- lose 10% effectiveness on soil-based abilities
- gain:

– +10% Vitality regen

– +10% brace duration

– lantern aura: +5% damage resist for allies, +3% stamina regen

- groundworks become “tool-based” versions (modified tile-based effects)

This keeps the class playable in dungeons without breaking immersion.

---

2.7 — TOOL MASTERY ENGINE

Tool Mastery is an internal stat unique to Farmers.

Tool Mastery increases:

- all tool-based damage
- caltrop/briar damage
- harvest attacks
- treated tool bonus duration
- brace retaliation damage
- minor increases to poultice effectiveness

Tool Mastery grows through:

- leveling
- some talents
- better tools
- treated implements (oils, saps)

---

2.8 — ALLY INTERACTION & GROUP SYNERGY

Allies benefit heavily from Farmer presence when they play correctly.

Ally Benefits:

- safer footing inside groundworks (defensive side only)
- better stamina and regen when close to lantern aura
- safe choke-holding via Bole Mound
- long-term sustain via meal buffs
- steady patch-ups between fights

Enemies are punished when they:

- rush Farmer in groundworks
- ignore briar patches
- move irregularly through caltrops
- stay on Farmer’s chosen ground for too long

---

2.9 — FARMER AS ENGINE-CLASS

The Farmer is not a burst class, but an engine class:

- attrition → preparation → sustain
- fights on their own terms
- wins long engagements
- keeps others alive
- shapes the battlefield

SECTION 6 — CLASS SYSTEMS & AI INTERACTION

Farmer — Brace Engine / Groundwork Engine / Campcraft Engine

---

6.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Farmer interaction rules (Engine-driven):

- Brace = short DR windows
- Groundworks = hazards + slows
- Campcraft = regen + sustain loops
- Grit = emergency & offensive windows
- Placement = timing + terrain identity

Enemies punished for staying in Farmer terrain too long.

---

6.1 BRACE ENGINE — AI RULES

AI respects Brace windows like this:

Melee AI

- delays heavy attacks during Brace
- attempts to break groundworks from edge
- tries to push Farmer off Bole Mound
- punishes missed Brace (if Farmer doesn’t time it well)

Ranged AI

- fires through Brace but moves away from groundworks
- attempts to interrupt Patch-Up
- focuses Garden Circle users

Boss AI

- purposefully attacks off-Brace
- pulls Farmer out of Garden Circle
- executes heavy attacks when Brace is down
- avoids staying in double groundwork stacks

---

6.2 GROUNDWORK ENGINE — AI INTERACTIONS

Enemies respond to placed ground:

- avoid briars unless enraged
- walk around caltrops unless narrow corridor
- attempt to jump/slip out of Mud Slick
- get slowed reliably by Sap Trap
- suffer stability penalties when pushing into Farmer’s chosen choke
- bosses temporarily ignore but still take penalty effects

---

6.3 CAMPCRAFT ENGINE — AI

AI allies behave around Farmer tools:

- stand inside Garden Circle for regen
- tanks park mobs in groundworks
- ranged allies stay near Lantern Comfort
- healers rely on poultice rhythm between fights
- melee DPS avoid Sap Trap but stay in Bole Mound

AI enemies recognize:

- Garden Circle = healing zone → try to move Farmer
- Bole Mound = DR spot → displace Farmer with knockback
- Lantern aura → reduce visibility for ambush

---

6.4 GRIT ENGINE — SPECIAL INTERACTIONS

If Farmer is stunned:

- Grit generation paused
- brace disabled
- hazards still function

If Farmer is silenced:

- almost no effect (non-magical class)

If Farmer is knocked back:

- Grit increases
- groundworks remain
- Brace cooldown unaffected

If Farmer kites:

- Grit gains slow
- hazard pressure decreases
- class becomes weaker the more it moves

---

6.5 SOIL & TERRAIN RULESET

Outdoor:

- full hazard strength
- full regen bonuses
- stronger brace windows
- better poultices

Indoor:

- −10% soil potency
- +10% brace duration
- +10% Vitality regen
- Lantern Comfort gives group resistance
- groundworks become tool-based variants (less soil, more placed objects)

---

6.6 PARTY COMPATIBILITY

Farmer is compatible with ALL classes:

Best with:

- Highlander
- Priest
- Warden
- Frost Guard

Neutral with:

- Witch
- Hunter

Slightly mismatched with:

- Seaborn
- Sand Strider

(too mobile; can’t hold ground long)

---

6.7 COMBAT ENGINE SUMMARY

Farmer wins:

- long fights
- choke fights
- outdoor fields
- multi-target brawls

Farmer loses:

- highly mobile skirmishers
- burst assassins
- open terrain with no cover
- long-range duelers
