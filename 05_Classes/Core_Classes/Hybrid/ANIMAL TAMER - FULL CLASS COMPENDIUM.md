# SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

## 1.1 Class Fantasy

The Tamer is a grounded melee fighter who battles alongside a trained living companion. Their strength comes not from magic, spirits, or summoned creatures — but from the real, breathing animal that chooses to stand beside them. The Tamer maintains control of the battlefield through bleeds, slows, cripples, and timed synergy windows, while their companion provides instinct-driven bursts and defensive support.

Their fantasy is defined by discipline, respect for the natural world, and learned mastery over training, bonding, and coordinated combat.

## 1.2 Combat Role

Primary Role: Melee DPS / Control

Secondary Role: Utility Off-Tank through companion intervention

Tamers excel at:

- sustained bleed pressure
- precise melee positioning
- companion instinct timing
- kiting + chase control
- consistent mid-range mobility
- joint burst windows with Instinctive Strike

## 1.3 Strengths

- Excellent sustained damage (bleeds + sync windows)
- Strong control toolkit (Hamstring, Cripple, slows)
- Extremely good solo capability
- Companion offers tanking utility
- Multiple viable build paths (Tamer-only, Pet-focused, Hybrid)
- High companion variety (12 distinct families)

## 1.4 Weaknesses

- Very limited ranged options
- Relies heavily on pet uptime
- Lower base armor than heavy classes
- Requires sync precision for peak output
- Weak against frequent target swapping

## 1.5 Resource / Armor / Weapon Identity

Resource: Vitality

Used for mobility, bleeds, and burst. Replaceable only by sustained pacing, not regen spam.

Armor:

Leather → light chain in late game.

Weapons:

Daggers, swords, axes, maces, spears, thrown weapons, bucklers.

---

# SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS

## 2.1 Companion System (1 Active Companion)

Tamers fight with one active companion at a time.

Commands:

- Attack — Engage target. Forces opening movement.
- Follow — Return to Tamer. Clears CC effects (with talents).
- Stay — Hold position; situational control.

Each companion has:

- 1–2 instinct abilities
- Basic attack
- Behavioral tuning by species
- Happiness state
- Bond scaling
- Trait Trees (Ferocity / Tenacity / Guile)

Companion responsiveness scales with Bond and species identity.

## 2.2 Bond System

Bond measures trust and cooperation between Tamer and companion.

Bond provides:

- Instinct responsiveness
- Damage bonuses
- Better accuracy and weak-point reliability
- Trait Points (1 point roughly every Bond level)
- Up to 54 Pet Trait Points at Bond 60

Bond increases through:

- Fighting together
- Feeding
- Not letting the pet die
- Travel time
- Successful instinct syncing
- Leveling

## 2.3 Happiness System

Happiness influences companion damage and Bond gain.

| State | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Happy | +20% pet damage, +30% Bond gain |
| Content | Baseline |
| Unhappy | –15% pet damage, –25% Bond gain |

Maintained with Feed Companion, rest, and avoiding pet deaths.

## 2.4 Sync Windows

If the Tamer and companion strike the same target within a timing window:

- Weak-point chance increases
- Instinctive Strike gains bonus damage
- Companion’s next instinct becomes stronger
- Some talents amplify burst during sync

This is the Tamer’s “high-skill” component.

## 2.5 Control Profile

The control loop is predictable:

Slow → Cripple → Bleed → Position → Sync → Burst → Sustain

This gives the class tactical pacing without overwhelming complexity.

# SECTION 7 — INTRO QUESTLINE: “PATH OF THE BOND”

Full Level 1–10 class introduction arc.

The Tamer’s introductory storyline teaches:

- early melee fundamentals
- restraint and precision
- how to weaken creatures without killing them
- how to tame safely
- how to feed, maintain Happiness, and avoid neglect
- how to control their first companion
- how to fight together as a pair

This mirrors the Hunter’s early-game teaching structure but remains grounded in your world.

---

## STAGE 1 — “Signs in the Grass”

Objective: Learn to use Animal Sense to track a juvenile beast in your region’s starting biome.

Elements taught:

- following tracks
- analyzing scat
- recognizing nesting marks
- observing creature behavior from a distance

This builds anticipation before the player earns their first companion.

---

## STAGE 2 — “Proving Patience”

Objective: Weaken a creature without killing it.

Teaches:

- restraint in combat
- stun/slow timing
- HP threshold requirement for Taming (20–30% HP)
- positioning discipline

If the creature is killed, the player must retry with another one — reinforcing careful play.

---

## STAGE 3 — “The Moment of Trust”

Objective: Use Tame Beast on the weakened creature.

Rules:

- Taming fails if the creature is still aggressive
- Fails if the player is hit during channel
- Fails if the creature panics or flees
- Success requires calm, control, and timing

This is the identity moment of the Tamer.

---

## STAGE 4 — “First Meal”

Objective: Feed your new companion to raise its Happiness to “Content.”

Teaches:

- Food types
- Happiness effects (+20% dmg / –15% dmg)
- Bond gain rate tied to happiness
- Basics of upkeep (no magic, real creature needs)

---

## STAGE 5 — “Training the Basics”

Objective: Complete three control scenarios using:

- Command: Attack
- Command: Follow
- Command: Stay

The player must:

- send the companion to hit a dummy
- reposition them mid-combat
- stop them from running ahead
- call them back during an ambush setup

---

## STAGE 6 — “Your First Hunt Together”

Objective: With your new companion, defeat a mid-tier creature as a team.

Teaches:

- maintaining bleed uptime
- using slows to help the companion stay in range
- coordinating instinct windows
- rotating Wild Strike → Rending Flurry → Instinctive Strike

This cements the core combat loop.

---

## STAGE 7 — “Claiming the Path”

Rewards:

- Handler’s Satchel (starter class item)
- Basic starting pet food
- A “Companion Tag” item (collar/identifier)
- Access to pet trait trees after gaining Bond levels
- Access to trainer for future skills

Story close:

“You now walk the true Tamer path — not alone, but never unguarded.”

---

# SECTION 8 — TRAINER NPCs (REGIONAL)

Each major region has a Tamer trainer whose personality and teaching philosophy reflects the local culture.

---

## 8.1 Alder Wynn — Forester Region

Personality: Calm, perceptive, grounded.

Teaches: Navigation, patience, natural signs.

Quote:

“A beast does not bow to force. It walks with you because you earned its trust.”

---

## 8.2 Hara Brann — Plainsfolk Region

Personality: Practical, blunt, hands-on.

Teaches: Combat synergy, handling under pressure.

Quote:

“A good pair doesn’t think. You just move — and the beast moves with you.”

---

## 8.3 Bryn Coldtrail — Tundran Region

Personality: Cold, efficient, severe.

Teaches: Survival under exhaustion, loyalty under strain.

Quote:

“If you falter, your beast freezes. Keep your strength or lose it all.”

---

## 8.4 Edda Mireclaw — Swamper Region

Personality: Eccentric, intuitive, sharp instincts.

Teaches: Reading fear, agitation, subtle behaviors.

Quote:

“Creatures see what we pretend isn’t there. Learn that, and they’ll never flee from you again.”

---

# SECTION 9 — LEVELING ROTATION & COMBAT FLOW

Mirrors the pacing and formatting of your other chapters.

---

## LEVEL 1–10 (Pre-Pet)

- Wild Strike → filler
- Hamstring Blow → control
- Cripple → soften dangerous mobs
- Field Dressing → between-fight sustain

Combat is slower, deliberate, and teaches the Tamer pacing before companions enter.

---

## LEVEL 10–20 (Early Pet Synergy)

- Open with Command: Attack
- Apply Cripple
- Apply Rending Flurry
- Use Handler’s Jab to remove threat from the pet when necessary
- Keep Field Dressing up for long pulls

The pet tanks most fights; you maintain bleeds and control.

---

## LEVEL 20–40 (Bleeds + Mobility Phase)

- Maintain Rending Flurry
- Control enemy movement with Hamstring
- Reposition using Tamer’s Lunge
- Maintain sync windows via Pack Rhythm
- You and companion alternate threat naturally

Bleeds become a major DPS slice.

---

## LEVEL 40–60 (Sync Burst Phase)

- Sync Instinctive Strike after companion instincts
- Burst with Tamer’s Surge during bleed uptime
- Rotate slows on elite mobs
- Use Last Stand Together for lethal windows
- Weak-point chaining becomes the strongest part of your kit

Endgame rotation is about timing, not spamming.

---

# SECTION 10 — VISUAL IDENTITY & ANIMATION NOTES

### Combat Stance

Low center of gravity, forward-leaning, weapon held at an angle that matches the companion’s stance.

### Melee Animation Style

Grounded, realistic, athletic.

No unrealistic acrobatics or fantastical particle effects.

- Wild Strike: quick diagonal chop
- Hamstring Blow: low sweeping cut
- Cripple: controlled, downward strike
- Rending Flurry: two rapid slashes → one deep cut
- Instinctive Strike: timed forward lunge synced with pet
- Tamer’s Lunge: short, tactical leap

### Companion Animation Style

Species-specific, realistic animal locomotion:

- bite, claw, snap, slam
- instinct animations distinct from basic attacks
- defensive instincts show posture shifts
- visual “sync cues” for burst windows (subtle)

### Audio Direction

- grounded physical contact sounds
- subtle rustling, breath, fabric tension
- animal roars, yelps, hisses based on family
- no magical hums or mystical VFX

---

# SECTION 11 — INTERNAL BALANCE NOTES & INTEGRATION

Matches the “internal balance” sections of your Hunter, Frost Guard, Highlander chapters.

---

## 11.1 DPS Distribution

At level 60 equilibrium:

- 55% player melee
- 30% companion
- 15% bleeds and DoT
    
    Aligned with Patch 1.0 global DPS norms.
    

---

## 11.2 Bleed Budget

Bleeds contribute about 14–18% of total DPS depending on uptime.

Comparable to bleed profiles of similar hybrid classes.

---

## 11.3 Sync Window Impact

Instinctive Strike is tuned so:

- base damage is moderate
- sync bonus is meaningful
- timing creates skill expression
- cannot outperform pure melees in raw burst

Design target:

Hunter-level burst, Highlander-level pacing, unique Tamer rhythm.

---

## 11.4 Survivability Profile

Tamer durability sits between:

- Below Highlander/Frost Guard (no heavy armor, no large DR tools)
- Above Hunter (thanks to pet DR, Handler talents, Field Dressing)

This fits your global survivability curve.

---

## 11.5 Mobility Profile

- mid-range mobility through Lunge
- predictable cooldown
- no spam movement
- balanced around positioning mastery

---

## 11.6 Pet Damage Philosophy

Pets must support the Tamer, not overshadow.

Ferocity builds can push pets up to ~45% of total DPS, but only in heavy investment builds.

---

## 11.7 Full Integration Notes

- Tamer now fits cleanly between Hunter and Highlander on the melee spectrum
- Companion Trait Trees give depth and replay value
- 12 families offer meaningful biome diversity
- Tamer is fully aligned with:
    - Patch 1.0 Combat Lock
    - Weapon rules
    - Armor tier progression
    - World identity (grounded realism)
    - Player-pet systems (Bond, Happiness, Traits)
    - Your ecosystem, biome logic, and rarity system

The class is now fully complete and fully integrated with Emberwild’s global ruleset.
