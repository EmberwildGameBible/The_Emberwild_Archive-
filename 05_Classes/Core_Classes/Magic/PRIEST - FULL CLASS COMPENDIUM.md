# PRIEST — FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

# SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

### 1.1 CLASS FANTASY — THE JUDGMENT-BEARER

The Priest is Emberwild’s pure holy retaliation archetype:

a cloth-armored wielder of consecrated justice who converts incoming harm into radiant punishment, stabilizes allies with wards, and defines the battlefield through sanctified zones.

Priests do not channel arcane spellcraft, shadow, spirits, or corruption.

Their power is rooted entirely in:

- righteousness
- consecration
- willpower
- discipline
- sanctified retaliation

Visual fantasy

- radiant bursts triggered by blows
- wards cracking open into holy shockwaves
- blind-flashes and judgment beams
- expanding discs of consecrated ground
- holy pressure waves at mid-range
- shimmering cloth robes reinforced with symbols

Identity pillars

- retaliation over aggression
- purity over darkness
- wards over armor
- judgment over brute force
- healing interwoven with justice
- sanctity over cooldowns
- holy zones over mobility

Where the Priest excels

- sustained retaliation damage
- punishing melee attackers
- zone control through wards + ground
- dungeon and elite mechanics
- multi-target scenarios
- hybrid healing roles
- mid-range crowd shaping (tuned)
- Sanctity-based burst phases

Where the Priest struggles

- pure long-range duels
- burst assassins without ward timing
- raw DPS races
- extreme kiting
- open-field skirmishes with no cover

The Priest is not a wizard, cleric, or paladin.

They are Emberwild’s holy retaliation specialist.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

Primary Role:

Retaliation DPS / Sanctity-Based Punisher

Secondary Role:

Support Healer / Zone Controller / Utility Cleanser

Combat profile

- low direct damage
- high retaliatory burst
- small but constant AoE pulses
- mid-range holy pressure (tuned via Radiant Lance)
- potent ward detonations
- sustained hybrid loops through Sanctity
- blind spikes and weaken effects at high Sanctity

Weaknesses

- cloth armor
- low mobility
- weaker at very long range
- requires engagement to build Sanctity
- momentum-based damage profile

Combat rewards:

- timing
- retaliation positioning
- ward placement
- managing Sanctity thresholds
- spacing inside consecrated ground
- punishing aggression
- baiting enemies into holy zones

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES

Armor:

- Cloth only (Level 1–60)

Priest survivability comes from wards, Sanctity, and positioning — not armor.

──────────────────────

Allowed Weapons

Primary

- Staves (main scaling weapon)

Secondary

- 1H Maces (ritual/holy melee only)
- Wands
- Hand-Crossbows / Light Firearms (caster-range implements; not weapon DPS tools)

Off-Hand

- Tomes
- Lanterns
- Holy Relics
- Scripture books

──────────────────────

Forbidden Weapon Categories

- Swords (all)
- Axes (all)
- Polearms / Spears
- Bows
- Crossbows (full-scale)
- Guns
- Thrown weapons
- Heavy melee tools

Priests are pure holy implement-users, not weapon fighters.

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.4 RESOURCE — SPIRIT & SANCTITY

Priests operate on a dual-resource model:

Spirit

- fuels healing, wards, and utility
- regenerates naturally
- classic healer-mana structure

Sanctity

- passive holy buildup
- generated when Priest is struck, heals, removes effects, or wards take damage
- amplified through retaliation and Radiant Pressure

Sanctity empowers:

- retaliation pulses
- Judgment scaling
- ward detonations
- blind chances
- instant-cast windows
- high-value burst phases

Sanctity is not spent directly.

Priest damage is based on thresholds, not “resource dumps.”

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.5 EXPLORATION & ENVIRONMENT SPECIALIZATION

Priests excel in:

- temples
- ruins
- consecrated sites
- sanctuaries
- graveyards
- ritual chambers
- holy shrines

Strengths:

- detecting corrupt influence
- illuminating hidden runes
- identifying weakened ward structures
- purifying tainted zones
- stabilizing sanctified ground

Drawbacks:

- limited ranged pressure in wide fields
- reactive pacing in exploration combat
- cannot brute-force wildlife without engagement
- struggles with fast-moving ranged beasts

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.6 GROUP ROLE — DUNGEONS & PARTY PLAY

Priests contribute:

- holy wards (absorb → explode)
- retaliation AoE for trash packs
- Sanctity-fueled burst windows
- sustain healing
- Purify utility
- blind/weaken disruption
- Consecrated Ground support zones
- stabilization during heavy mechanics

Weaknesses:

- requires positioning discipline
- struggles in kiting groups
- Sanctity-dependent DPS flow
- vulnerable before wards are placed

────────────────────────────────────────

### 1.7 DAMAGE PROFILE & SCALING

Damage Sources

1. Retaliation pulses
2. Ward detonations
3. Judgment spells
4. Consecrated burn zones
5. Penance Burst
6. Divine Sentence
7. Sanctity threshold bonuses

- strong in sustained combat
- anti-melee control
- multi-target soft AoE
- mid-range holy beam counterplay (tuned)

- finishing power at 60+ Sanctity

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS & SANCTITY SYSTEM

The Priest’s mechanics revolve around converting incoming harm, healing output, and consecrated positioning into holy retaliation and judgment bursts.

Everything ties into four engines:

1. Retaliation Engine — reactive holy pulses
2. Sanctity Engine — dynamic power scaling
3. Ward Engine — absorb → detonate → punish
4. Radiant Pressure Engine — instant-cast combo system

These define Priest gameplay at all levels.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.0 — MECHANICAL OVERVIEW

Priest combat is reactive, positional, and momentum-based.

Unlike casters, priests ramp damage by:

- taking hits
- healing allies
- absorbing blows through wards
- cleansing effects
- building Sanctity passively

Priests reach peak power when:

- enemies stay inside ward/ground zones
- Sanctity ≥ 40 (strong tier)
- Sanctity ≥ 60 (burst tier)
- Radiant Pressure hits 5 stacks (judgment combo window)

This creates a holy damage profile that is slow to start, but deadly once fully built.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.1 — HOLY RETALIATION ENGINE

Retaliation pulses are triggered when the Priest:

- is struck by melee or ranged attacks
- has a ward absorb damage
- breaks a ward
- heals an ally
- purifies an effect
- reaches Sanctity thresholds

Retaliation mechanics (tuned):

- deals holy damage in a 4.5 m radius (increased from 4.0 m)
- never misses
- hits all enemies in range
- scales with Spirit + Sanctity
- applies minor accuracy debuff at high Sanctity
- feeds Radiant Pressure stacks

Internal spacing:

Retaliation has a 0.5s internal cooldown to prevent ultra-rapid pulse spam.

Impact of tuning:

The increased radius significantly improves mid-range consistency and fairness in ranged matchups, without increasing raw damage.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.2 — SANCTITY ENGINE (UPDATED)

Sanctity is a passive holy charge.

It rises constantly from:

- being struck
- wards taking damage
- wards breaking
- casting Light Mend
- casting Light Mend Wave
- Purify (large Sanctity gain)
- Radiant Pressure combo finishes
- healing criticals
- healing allies in Consecrated Ground
- Radiant Lance hits (tuned: +2 Sanctity)

Sanctity does not have a maximum.

Instead, every 20 points moves the Priest into a stronger tier.

### Sanctity Tiers

0–19 — Minor Sanctity

- small retaliation
- weak ward bursts

20–39 — Moderate Sanctity

- retaliation pulses intensify
- wards explode harder

40–59 — High Sanctity

- Judgment deals significant damage
- retaliation pulses apply weak blind
- Consecrated Ground becomes threatening

60+ — Divine Sanctity

- Judgment blinds
- Penance Burst becomes lethal
- Divine Sentence becomes devastating
- retaliation pulses weaken enemy damage

### Sanctity Decay (Tuned)

Sanctity decays slower now:

Out of Combat:

- 2 every 4 sec (previously 3 sec)

In Combat (no damage taken):

- 5 every 10 sec (previously 8 sec)

This tuning allows the Priest to retain momentum long enough to counter ranged kiting.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.3 — RADIANT PRESSURE ENGINE

Radiant Pressure stacks accumulate from:

- retaliation pulses
- ward detonations
- healing criticals
- Purify
- Consecrated Ground interactions
- being struck at Sanctity ≥40

Max stacks: 5

Decay: resets after 10 seconds without gaining stacks.

At 5 stacks, the next Judgment is:

- instant-cast
- deals bonus damage
- blinds the target
- heals the Priest slightly
- grants +20 Sanctity
- can be used as a mid-range punish

This is the Priest’s main burst window.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.4 — WARDS (ABSORB → DETONATE → SANCTITY)

Priest wards:

- absorb incoming damage
- crack visibly under pressure
- generate Sanctity per hit taken
- explode upon breaking or expiry
- deal AoE holy damage
- empower Retaliation Engine
- apply blind at high Sanctity

### Ward Radius (Tuned)

All ward detonations now have +10% increased radius.

This strengthens Priest zone control without increasing damage numbers.

### Ward Types

1. Minor Consecrated Ward
2. Greater Ward of Radiance
3. Punishing Ward
4. Radiant Barrier

Each ward follows the same logic:

Absorb → Sanctity → Detonate → Pulse → Radiant Pressure

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.5 — DOT INTERACTION (NEW TUNING RULE)

Originally, DoTs gave the Priest nothing, which made the Witch matchup unfair.

New Rule:

Damaging DoTs grant +1 Sanctity per tick, capped at 1 per second.

DoTs do NOT trigger retaliation pulses, keeping class identity intact.

This change:

- adds fairness
- keeps Priest vulnerable to casters
- fixes the hard negative matchup
- without altering power level in melee fights

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.6 — JUDGMENT ABILITIES

Judgments are the only direct offensive attacks Priest has:

- Radiant Flicker
- Holy Lash
- Judgment of Light
- Condemnation
- Radiant Lance
- Divine Sentence

Their damage is built from:

- Spirit
- Spell Power
- Sanctity tier
- Radiant Pressure bonus

### Radiant Lance (Tuned)

- range increased from 20 m → 24 m
- now grants +2 Sanctity on hit
- minor projectile speed increase (implicit via tuning)

This gives Priest a single, fair mid-range punish tool.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.7 — CONSECRATED GROUND (TUNED)

Consecrated Ground creates a holy zone:

- burns enemies (damage slightly increased)
- grants Sanctity when healing allies inside
- reduces Sanctity decay temporarily
- weakens enemy accuracy
- amplifies retaliation pulses inside the zone

### Tuning:

- radius increased 6 m → 7 m
- burn tick damage +5%

This ensures Consecrated Ground has real presence in mid-range skirmishes.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.8 — HEAL-TO-PUNISH SYNERGY

Priest healing automatically fuels offensive potential.

Every time the Priest heals:

- Sanctity rises
- retaliation pulses intensify
- next Judgment gains bonus scaling
- wards absorb more damage
- Radiant Pressure stack chance increases

Healing is not a separate “role” — it is part of the Priest’s retaliation loop.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2.9 — NEW PASSIVE: LIGHT ECHO (TUNED ADDITION)

Added at Level 22 for natural progression.

Light Echo

“When you deal holy damage at more than 20 meters range, gain:

- +1 Sanctity
- -1 sec from Sanctity decay timer”

This stabilizes ranged matchups without giving Priest real ranged burst.

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 6 — CLASS SYSTEMS & AI INTERACTION

Priest — Holy Retaliation / Sanctity Engine / Ward Detonation Framework

This section defines the precise rules the engine, combat scripts, and AI follow when interacting with the Priest.

It is written in the same deep-logic style as the Hunter’s Weak-Point Engine and Frost Guard’s Chill→Brittle Engine.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Priest gameplay is governed by four interconnected engines:

1. Retaliation Engine
2. Sanctity Engine
3. Ward Engine (Absorb → Detonate → Sanctity)
4. Radiant Pressure Engine (Combo Window System)

These engines ensure:

- damage taken → retaliation pulses
- healing → Sanctity + retaliation
- wards breaking → AoE holy damage + Sanctity
- Sanctity increasing → higher damage + blind windows
- Radiant Pressure → instant Judgment finishers

Priest is a defensive → offensive conversion class — uniquely reactive.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.1 RETALIATION ENGINE

(Updated with tuned radius + DoT → Sanctity interaction)

### Retaliation Pulse Trigger Conditions

A holy retaliation pulse triggers when:

- Priest is struck by a physical attack
- Priest is struck by any direct-damage spell
- a Ward takes damage
- a Ward breaks
- Priest lands a heal
- Priest purifies a debuff
- Priest hits a target with Radiant Flicker or Radiant Lance (Light Echo)
- Priest reaches a Sanctity threshold (40 or 60)

### Retaliation Pulse Rules

- always hits (cannot miss)
- deals holy damage
- scales with Spirit → Spell Power → Sanctity tier
- grants +1 Radiant Pressure
- small accuracy debuff at Sanctity ≥40
- guaranteed blind chance at Sanctity ≥60
- cannot be silenced, interrupted, stunned, or disarmed

### Retaliation Radius

Base radius: 4.5 meters (tuned)

(This is the radius used for all Radiant Pulse ranks.)

### Internal Cooldown

- minimum 0.5 sec gap between pulses
- prevents infinite chain explosions in large melee clusters

### Retaliation & Damage Over Time

A new tuned rule: Holy retaliation is triggered by DoTs only when the final tick deals damage.

Each final DoT tick →

- triggers a reduced retaliation pulse
- grants +1 Sanctity

Prevents infinite loops with multi-dotting enemies.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.2 SANCTITY ENGINE

(Fully rebalanced: decay tuning, ranged sustain, spike rules.)

Sanctity is a dynamic passive resource constantly rising and falling.

### Sanctity Gain Sources

- taking damage
- Ward taking damage
- Ward breaking
- healing allies
- Purify
- Radiant Pressure 5-stack
- Radiant Lance (tuned +2)
- Light Echo (ranged hit above 20m)
- critical heals
- healing allies inside Consecrated Ground

### Sanctity Tiers

- 0–19: minor retaliation
- 20–39: moderate retaliation
- 40–59: high retaliation, blind chance
- 60+: overwhelming retaliation, guaranteed blind, huge Judgment multiplier

### Sanctity Decay (TUNED)

Out of combat:

- −2 Sanctity every 3 seconds

In combat:

- −5 Sanctity every 8 seconds if not taking damage
- decay pauses while healing
- decay pauses for 1 second when Radiant Lance hits at 20+ meters
- Light Echo adds −1 second decay delay

### Sanctity Soft Cap

Sanctity has no hard numeric cap — it simply grants no further bonuses above ~130.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.3 WARD ENGINE (ABSORB → DETONATE → SANCTITY)

(Integrated radius tuning + AI logic + double-detonation talents)

Wards are the core of Priest defense & offense.

### Ward Rules

- 1 Ward baseline
- 2 Wards with Aegis Talents
- absorb damage before health
- scale with Spirit + Spell Power
- last 10–15 seconds depending on type
- generate Sanctity on every hit absorbed

### Ward Detonation Conditions

A Ward explodes when:

- its absorb value is depleted
- it expires naturally
- Divine Reprisal forces detonation
- Shield of the Absolute (capstone) tensions it

### Detonation Effects

- holy AoE blast
- tuned radius: 5.5 meters (base)
- damage scales with missing OR remaining absorb
- always grants Sanctity
- high Sanctity may blind targets
- can chain-trigger retaliation pulses

### Double Detonation (Talent-Based)

With Wall of Faith, all wards:

- detonate normally
- detonate again at 40–80% power

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.4 RADIANT PRESSURE ENGINE (COMBO SYSTEM)

(Instant Judgment → Blind → Heal → Sanctity Loop)

Radiant Pressure is the Priest’s combo stack system.

### Gain Conditions

+1 Radiant Pressure on:

- retaliation pulses
- heals that crit
- Purify
- ward detonations
- hitting enemies in Consecrated Ground
- taking damage while Sanctity ≥40

### Rules

- max 5 stacks
- stacks last 10 seconds
- dropping a stack resets the whole sequence

### At 5 Stacks

The next Judgment becomes:

- instant
- deals bonus damage
- blinds for 0.5–1 sec
- restores small health
- grants +20 Sanctity

This is the Priest’s primary burst window engine.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.5 CONSECRATED GROUND ENGINE

(7m tuned radius, heal interactions, weaken debuff, zone AI)

Consecrated Ground (CG) is a holy zone that shapes battlefield flow.

### Core Rules

- lasts 6–10 seconds
- 7m radius (tuned)
- deals holy burn per second
- increases Sanctity generation when healing allies inside
- reduces enemy Accuracy slightly
- causes enemies to take more retaliation damage inside

### Player Interactions

Standing inside CG grants Priest:

- slower Sanctity decay
- small Spirit regen
- increased retaliation radius
- slightly increased blind chance

### Ally Interactions

Allies standing inside CG gain:

- slight DR (with Radiant Buffer talent)
- healing from Holy Breath talent

### AI Interactions

Enemy AI:

- avoids CG if healthy
- enters CG if enraged or high threat
- attempts to pull Priest out of CG
- will avoid CG during blind windows

CG is the Priest’s “control platform” — similar to a frost zone or root web.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.6 AI INTERACTION LOGIC — PRIEST AS ENEMY

(Full AI behaviors tuned for mid-range, wards, and Sanctity.)

## Melee AI Behavior

- backs away if Sanctity ≥50
- prioritizes breaking wards
- circles to avoid Consecrated Ground
- lunges during Sanctity decay windows
- retreats when blinded
- attacks faster when Priest uses Radiant Lance
- attempts flanking to avoid retaliation cone

## Ranged AI Behavior

- attempts to stay outside 24m Radiant Lance range
- attacks between retaliation pulse timings
- uses interrupts aggressively during heals
- focuses wards with ranged fire at low HP
- pulls Priest out of CG with displacement abilities

## Elite/Boss AI

- deliberately breaks Wards
- tries to prevent Sanctity reaching 60+
- pulls Priest out of zones
- applies periodic debuffs to force Purify
- reacts to Divine Reprisal by disengaging briefly
- uses slow-ticks to reduce retaliation triggers

Elites almost “know” Priest windows — creating skill-intensive duels.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.7 AI INTERACTION — PRIEST AS ALLY (NPC BEHAVIORS)

Allied NPCs interacting with Priest follow strict rules:

### General Ally Rules

Allies:

- avoid blocking ward detonations
- attempt to stand inside Consecrated Ground
- stay in Priest’s LOS for heals
- avoid pulling enemies away from wards

### Tank Allies

- taunt immediately after a Priest’s ward detonation
- avoid dragging mobs off CG
- group enemies to maximize retaliation

### Ranged Allies

- keep line-of-sight open
- avoid stepping into blind flashes
- help break wards strategically when called

### Healer Allies

- treat Priests as secondary tanks in AoE packs
- allow Priest to self-heal for Sanctity generation

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.8 EDGE CASES & SPECIAL INTERACTIONS

(Bulletproofing all weird scenarios.)

### If Priest is Stunned

- retaliation still works
- wards still absorb and detonate
- Sanctity still increases
- Judgment cannot be cast

### If Priest is Silenced

- retaliation continues
- wards still function
- Sanctity still increases
- heals disabled
- judgments disabled

### If Priest is Knocked Back

- Sanctity decay pauses for 0.5 sec
- retaliation continues
- Consecrated Ground remains where placed

### If Priest is Immobilized

- Sanctity spikes from taking damage
- Radiant Pressure builds rapidly
- retaliation becomes primary DPS

### If Priest Attempts Long-Range Kiting

- retaliation decreases
- Sanctity rises slower
- Radiant Lance + Light Echo sustain is the only ranged support
- ranged enemies pressure the Priest harder

────────────────────────────────────────

# 6.9 SANCTITY SPIKE WINDOWS (40+ AND 60+)

(Defines exact thresholds for power.)

### At Sanctity 40+

- retaliation pulses double
- Judgment gains heavy bonus
- blind chance becomes moderate
- burst windows open

### At Sanctity 60+

- retaliation pulses apply accuracy debuff
- blind is guaranteed on Judgment
- Divine Sentence becomes lethal
- ward detonations double-blind targets
- Sanctity amplifies all AoE by large multipliers

These spike rules ensure Priest keeps up with high-end burst classes.

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 7 — VISUAL, AUDIO & ANIMATION IDENTITY

Priest — Pure Holy Retaliation / Ward Master / Sanctity Specialist

This entire section is structured identically to Highlander, Frost Guard, Sandstrider, and Hunter visual identity documents.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.1 VISUAL IDENTITY

### Holy Theme (Core Aesthetic)

The Priest is defined by radiant retaliation, not spellcasting theatrics.

Visual tone:

- white-gold radiance
- geometric pulses instead of sparkles
- flashes resembling compressed light pressure
- modest vestments with metallic threading
- grounded, church-militant look
- no overt magic wizardry
- no angelic wings or fantasy halos

The Priest visually represents defensive holiness weaponized through pressure, warding, and retaliation.

---

## Silhouette & Costume Language

Priest silhouette must always be recognizable by:

- layered cloth robes
- minimal armor plates (symbolic, not functional)
- belts holding tomes, relics, lanterns
- staff or mace held as a ritual tool
- subtle metallic trims
- posture disciplined and upright
- geometry and symmetry rather than flourish

Their gear does not exaggerate fantasy — it stays grounded and believable.

---

## Ward Visuals (Tuned)

Ward visuals reflect the new tuned behavior:

- appear as faint, circular geometric shields
- edges crack more visibly as they absorb damage
- tuned radius (5.5m) represented by a slightly larger outer shimmer
- breaking emits a bright, concussive flash
- secondary detonation (if talented) appears as inner → outer pulse

Wards should look structurally tense, as if holding back pressure.

---

## Retaliation Pulse Visuals

Retaliation pulses emphasize holy force, not magic:

- soft white-gold shockwave bursting from the Priest’s chest
- cloth fluttering outward slightly
- exact tuned radius (4.5m) suggested by a faint circular ripple
- tiny flecks of radiant dust
- brighter flashes at Sanctity 40+
- cone of sparks at Sanctity 60+

Pulse visuals should be readable even in crowded fights.

---

## Judgment Visuals

Judgments are linear, compressed radiance:

- sharp, needle-thin lines of light
- instantly snapping from Priest’s hand
- small light deformation along path
- blind-flash (0.5–1 sec) at max Sanctity

---

## Consecrated Ground Visuals (7m Tuned Radius)

Consecrated Ground uses:

- large circular runic seal
- faint heat-haze distortion
- slow rotating inner ring
- soft gold flicker along symbols
- subtle burning emission on enemies standing within

The tuned radius is visually supported by a clearly readable outer boundary.

---

## Radiant Lance Visuals (24m Range)

Long-range holy spear-beam:

- narrow spear of gold-white pressure
- minimal glow, more like compressed air
- faint crackling along its length
- slight recoil on Priest’s arms
- Sanctity hit effect adds a tiny spark

---

## Divine Reprisal & Divine Sentence

Divine Reprisal:

- inward-suction glow → explosive outward flare
- faint corona of rotating geometry
- retaliation pulses brighter + faster

Divine Sentence:

- staff planted or foot braced
- cone erupts like a radiant shockwave
- ground cracks briefly with light
- enemies hit stagger visually

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.2 ANIMATION THEMES

Priest animations must feel:

- grounded
- restrained
- realistic
- tense
- retaliation-focused

No flamboyant wizard movements — discipline over flourish.

---

### General Movement

- upright posture
- controlled, deliberate steps
- robes swaying naturally
- slight lean-in under pressure
- stance widens on incoming blows

---

## Casting Animations

Priest casting is minimal:

- palms open or lowered
- short hand-thrust for Judgment
- both hands clasped for healing
- slight forward lean during Radiant Lance
- tracing small circle for ward placement
- controlled downward hand movement for Consecrated Ground

Animations must look like ritual precision, not spell theatrics.

---

## Retaliation Pulse Animations

Triggered when struck:

- shoulders tense
- torso contracts slightly
- flash at the sternum or palms
- cloth ripples outward
- shockwave expands at tuned 4.5m

This is the defining Priest animation.

---

## Ward Animations

Placement:

- draw a small geometric sigil in the air
- ward shimmers into being instantly
- visual tension lines form along edges

Breaking:

- flash of white-gold light
- concussive outward burst
- shards of light scatter
- second detonation if talented

---

## Consecrated Ground Animations

- one hand raised
- short push downward
- holy seal stamps the ground with force
- faint dust lift as runes ignite

---

## Divine Reprisal Animation

- both arms raised
- golden particle pull-in
- rapid glow intensification
- continuous pulse of pressure around Priest

---

## Divine Sentence Animation

- Priest plants staff firmly
- torso tightens
- radiant cone erupts explosively
- slight backward recoil

────────────────────────────────────────

# 7.3 AUDIO IDENTITY

(Holy pressure, not sparkles or magic chimes.)

Priest audio style is:

- pressure waves
- crystalline strain
- deep hums
- soft choral resonance

No sparkles. No magical twinkling.

---

## Core Sound Families

### Retaliation Pulses

- low, quick “THOOM”
- metallic resonance
- faint chest-level vibration
- slight distortion wave

### Ward Sounds

- crystalline tension while absorbing
- crack-pop as it reaches limit
- bassy thump on detonation
- 2-stage detonation if talented

### Judgments

- linear “snap”
- sharp beamlike impact
- slight metal-rod strike reverb

### Healing

- soft, rising harmonic warmth
- faint choral breath
- slight metallic overtone

### Consecrated Ground

- faint, lower-frequency hum
- slow geometric rotation noises
- subtle ground resonance

### Radiant Lance

- tight beam compression sound
- sharp hiss upon release

### Divine Reprisal

- rising hum
- sudden large “pulse”
- sub-bass aftershock

### Divine Sentence

- compressed air blast
- cone-shaped pressure roar
- lingering low-end rumble

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 8 — BUILD THEORY, META, AND ENDGAME PATHING

Priest — Pure Holy Retaliation / Ward Master / Sanctity Specialist

Priest builds scale around three pillars:

1. Retaliation (damage taken → DPS)
2. Wards (absorb → explode)
3. Sanctity (momentum → burst windows)

This section explains:

- stat priorities
- weapon synergy
- ability chains
- advanced builds
- leveling paths
- matchup spread

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.1 STAT PRIORITIES (BY ROLE)

## A. Radiant Vow — Retaliation / Sanctity DPS

1. Spirit (primary holy scaling)
2. Spell Power
3. Sanctity Gain / Sanctity Retention
4. Critical Strike (for Radiant Pressure)
5. Stamina (more hits → more retaliation)
6. Haste (small Judgment gain)

## B. Aegis of Light — Ward Defense / Support Tank

1. Spirit
2. Stamina
3. Spell Power
4. Ward Strength / Absorb Mods
5. Damage Reduction
6. Sanctity Retention

## C. Sacred Ministry — Healer / Purifier

1. Spirit
2. Spell Power
3. Haste
4. Critical Strike
5. Stamina

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.2 WEAPON SYNERGY

### Staves

Best weapon type.

- largest Spirit scaling
- biggest Spell Power potential
- consistent animation rhythm
- stable for Radiant Lance recoil
- optimal for all Priest builds

### 1H Maces + Off-Hand

- increased survivability
- stronger ward synergies
- staff remains better for DPS, but this is best for Aegis/Ministry
- optimal for hybrid Priest-tank or group healer variants

### Wands / Hand Crossbows

- long-range tagging
- Light Echo synergy at 20+ meters
- used to prevent Sanctity decay
- strictly weaker for DPS
- niche support tool

Weapon identity remains grounded and holy — never martial.

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.3 ABILITY SYNERGY (REAL ROTATIONS)

Priest does not have rigid rotations — it has reactive priority chains.

## Radiant Vow (DPS Priority Loop)

1. Keep Reproach Aura active

2. Maintain an active Ward

3. Build Sanctity (through hits / heals / Purify)

4. At Sanctity ≥40:

- Judgment → Condemnation → Pulse chain

5. At 5 Radiant Pressure:

- instant Judgment burst

6. At Sanctity ≥60:

- Divine Sentence or Penance Burst

7. Consecrated Ground for multi-target

Identity: defensive → offensive conversion.

---

## Aegis of Light (Tank-Support Loop)

1. Maintain Greater Ward of Radiance

2. Punishing Ward on cooldown

3. Consecrated Ground before pulls

4. Light Mend Wave for Sanctity

5. Save Penance Burst for clustered mobs

6. Divine Reprisal during heavy incoming

Identity: holy detonator tank-support.

---

## Sacred Ministry (Healer Loop)

1. Light Mend → Wave → Light Mend cycle

2. Judgment on cooldown for Light Messenger

3. Consecrated Ground under allies

4. Purify constantly

5. Divine Intercession for burst windows

Identity: holy sustain healer.

────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────

# 8.6 MATCHUP ANALYSIS (TUNED)

Priest vs Melee:

S-tier.

- retaliation radius punishes
- ward detonations forced
- blind windows
- Shackles + slow + pulses

PRI strongest matchup.

Priest vs Ranged:

C-tier (unless Light Echo maintained).

- ranged can kite judgment windows
- Sanctity decay pressure
- Radiant Lance helps but doesn’t delete them

Weakest matchup.

Priest vs Assassins:

B-tier.

- strong vs melee
- weak vs vanish-openers

Best when Sanctity is pre-charged.

Priest vs Tanks:

B-tier.

- ward detonations help
- but tanks reduce Sanctity gain by spacing attacks

Priest vs Casters:

A-tier.

- retaliation triggers on direct damage
- blind + purge destroys casting rhythm

────────────────────────────────────────

# SECTION 9 — PASSIVE SYSTEMS & ROLE SUMMARY (TUNED EDITION)

Pure Holy / Retaliation / Sanctity Specialist

────────────────────────────────────────

This version includes:

- retaliation radius buff
- Sanctity decay tuning
- Radiant Lance range & value upgrades
- Consecrated Ground burn buffs
- mid-range compensation rules
- extended AI logic
- updated role and matchup analysis
- strengthened “holy warrior, not a caster” identity
- full endgame viability

Everything below is the authoritative tuned edition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 9.1 PASSIVE SYSTEMS (TUNED)

### 1. Holy Weapon Discipline (Re-Tuned)

Priests never “glance” or deal half-strength hits.

Your holy damage always resolves at full value.

Additional tuning:

- +4% baseline holy accuracy
- +10% improved mid-range hit consistency (8–15m)
- Radiant Lance benefits from this baseline

### 2. The Sanctity Economy (Core Engine)

Sanctity now fuels the entire kit more efficiently:

- Sanctity decay reduced: 3 every 10 seconds (was 5 every 8s)
- Healing allies slows decay by 50%
- Standing still for 1.5s reduces decay by 20%
- DoT damage taken generates +1 Sanctity per tick

This ensures:

- ranged enemies do not hard-counter Priest as easily
- long gaps between hits do not drop DPS to zero
- heal-weaving fuels DPS naturally

### 3. Lightweight Armor Logic

Priests wear cloth but compensate with:

- +6% passive magical DR
- +4% passive ranged DR
- Ward absorption scaling improved by Spell Power
- High Sanctity (50+) grants brief stagger resistance

This keeps Priest fragile yet not helpless.

### 4. Retaliation Engine (Tuned Radius & Scaling)

Retaliation pulses now:

- radius: 4.5m → 6m
- damage +11%
- +1 Sanctity per pulse
- apply a 0.25s micro-flinch to attackers at Sanctity ≥60

This makes retaliation meaningful in melee clusters (dungeons, elites).

### 5. Consecrated Zone Interaction (Tuned)

Standing in your own Consecrated Ground now grants:

- +10% retaliation radius
- +6% Spirit regen
- +4% Sanctity retention
- +3% DR vs ranged attacks
- +1 Sanctity per second

Enemies inside:

- accuracy −7%
- burn damage +15%
- retaliation taken increased by 10%

### 6. Wardmaster’s Presence (Improved Engine)

Wards tuned to make Priest feel like a true zone-control class.

Wards now:

- detonate for +10% radius
- generate +2 bonus Sanctity on natural expiration
- generate +4 bonus Sanctity if broken by melee
- apply a brief blind flash at Sanctity ≥60

This elevates Priest offense and defense, especially in tight spaces.

### 7. Light-Forged Resilience (Tuned Survivability)

Priests now passively gain:

- +8% healing done to self from retaliation
- +10% shorter stun duration
- Sanctity decays slower when under 50% health

Priest survivability now scales with correct positioning, not armor.

## 9.2 ROLE SUMMARY AT LEVEL 60 (TUNED)

At max level, the Priest becomes one of Emberwild’s most reactive, punishing, and zone-controlling classes.

### Primary Role — Holy Retaliation DPS

Priest excels at:

- punishing melee attackers
- punishing clustered enemies
- surviving while dealing consistent holy damage
- turning enemy aggression into DPS

Their damage model is:

- weak opener
- escalating tempo
- heavy Sanctity burst window
- large retaliation AoE
- massive ward explosions

Priests win by enduring, not by striking first.

---

### Secondary Role — Ward Defender / AoE Punisher

Priest shines in multi-target engagements:

- Punishing Ward
- Greater Ward of Radiance
- Consecrated Ground
- Radiant Pulse chains
- Penance Burst

These combine into a room-clearing rotation.

Priest performs exceptionally well in:

- dungeon packs
- hallway pulls
- mixed elite fights

---

### Tertiary Role — Healer / Purifier

(Not a classic MMO healer — a holy sustain hybrid.)

Strengths:

- consistent single-target sustain
- AoE healing waves
- instant heal windows
- constant Purify utility
- healing weaves fuel DPS through Sanctity

Weaknesses:

- low burst healing
- must manage spacing
- relies on wards to survive focus-fire

Priests uniquely heal by doing damage and taking damage.

---

### Quaternary Role — Support Specialist

Priest brings:

- blind-flashes
- DR buffs
- sanctified accuracy debuffs
- Purify windows
- Consecrated zone healing
- group Sanctity engines

Priest is a top-tier purifier class.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 9.3 COMBAT STRENGTHS (TUNED)

Priest is exceptionally strong in:

### 1v1 vs melee

### 3–6 target dungeon packs

### extended elite fights

### mixed melee+caster engagements

### arena choke points

### dungeon trash waves

Strengths:

- very high retaliation uptime
- excellent AoE scaling
- strong sustain from Judgment healing
- anti-melee zone control
- good Purify throughput
- Sanctity models high player skill
- mid-range Radiant Lance solves kiting problem
- wards punish enemies who overcommit

Priest becomes progressively stronger the longer a fight lasts.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 9.4 COMBAT WEAKNESSES (TUNED)

Priest still has deliberate weaknesses:

- weak initial burst
- needs time to ramp Sanctity
- vulnerable to heavy ranged openers
- reliant on terrain
- wards must be positioned properly
- poor uptime vs high-mobility archers
- cloth armor limits misplays
- weak 20+ meter DPS

These ensure Priest is strong but not overpowered.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 9.5 DESIGN INTENT SUMMARY — FINAL TUNED EDITION

Priest is not:

- a caster
- a DPS nuker
- a plate paladin
- a ranged specialist

Priest is:

- a holy retaliation engine
- a Sanctity-based escalating punisher
- a defensive DPS hybrid
- a zone-based control specialist
- a hybrid sustain healer
- a melee counterclass
- a dungeon specialist

The tuning performed earlier now ensures:

- mid-range weakness is softened, not erased
- retaliation stays Priest’s strongest tool
- Sanctity windows feel powerful but fair
- ward explosions scale meaningfully into endgame
- priest heals and DPS correctly weave together

This tuned Section 9 is now fully finalized, AAA-ready, and balanced under Patch 1.0 Combat Lock.
