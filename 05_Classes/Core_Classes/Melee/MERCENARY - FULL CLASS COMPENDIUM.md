## SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

1.1 CLASS FANTASY — THE WAR-FORGED EXECUTIONER

The Mercenary is Emberwild’s ruthless melee specialist:

a close-quarters combatant defined by endurance, brutality, precision strikes, and controlled burst windows.

Not a berserker.

Not a tank.

Not an assassin.

A professional killer whose strength comes from sustained pressure, tactical openings, and finishing expertise.

Mercenaries fight for coin, survival, and advantage. They carry steel with practiced, understated efficiency, breaking guards, staggering foes, and creating opportunities to drive decisive finishing blows.

Identity pillars

- discipline over rage
- technique over chaos
- openings over spam
- pressure over burst
- finishing strikes over random crits
- grit over finesse
- durability through experience, not armor

Where the Mercenary excels

- sustained melee DPS
- controlled burst windows
- exploiting weakened enemies
- stagger and guard-break tools
- single-target pressure
- tactical survival tools
- counter-engagement reads
- executing low-health targets

Where the Mercenary struggles

- ranged duels
- heavy crowd control
- long chase scenarios
- high-mobility skirmishers
- magical burst
- fast-reset ranged classes

The Mercenary is not a tank, not a hybrid, not a bruiser.

They are Emberwild’s grounded melee damage specialist.

1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

Primary Role:

- Melee DPS (sustained pressure with controlled burst)

Secondary Role:

- Duelist / Guard-Breaker

Combat profile

- medium sustained DPS
- strong execution damage
- controlled burst rather than front-loaded spike
- stagger and guard-break utility
- deliberate footwork
- defensive tools tied to technique

Weaknesses

- minimal ranged threat
- low mobility
- limited AoE
- reliant on timing openings
- requires commitment to melee range
- vulnerable to kiting

Combat rewards

- timing
- trading efficiency
- reading enemy openings
- proper Momentum Engine usage
- stagger and guard-break sequencing
- positioning within melee range
- finishing discipline

---

1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES

Armor:

- Medium armor (Level 1–60)

Mercenary survivability comes from technique and passive mitigation, not plate armor.

Allowed Weapons

Primary

- One-Handed Swords
- One-Handed Axes
- Maces
- Daggers
- Dual-wield weapons (paired light weapons)

Secondary

- Two-Handed Swords
- Two-Handed Axes
- Polearms (select mercenary variants)

Off-Hand

- Bucklers
- Parrying daggers
- Weighted gloves (unarmed variant)

Forbidden Weapons

- Heavy shields
- Staves
- Wands
- Magical implements
- Heavy crossbows
- Firearms

Mercenaries rely on practiced steel, not magic or ranged dominance.

---

1.4 RESOURCE — STAMINA & MOMENTUM

Mercenaries operate on a dual-resource model.

Stamina

- fuels strikes, guard-breaks, and defensive actions
- regenerates passively
- influences ability cadence
- cannot be stacked or banked

Momentum

- generated by proper trading, guard-breaking, staggering, and aggressive follow-through
- not generated by random crits
- increases based on correct sequencing
- decays quickly out of combat
- spent automatically during finishing windows
- never exceeds 100

Momentum empowers:

- finishing strikes
- stagger potency
- guard-break duration
- controlled burst sequences
- execution damage
- certain passive amplifiers

Momentum is not a damage steroid.

It is a window-enabler.

---

1.5 EXPLORATION & ENVIRONMENT SPECIALIZATION

Mercenaries excel in:

- close-quarters combat
- mines, forts, tunnels
- urban or tight environments
- indoor choke points
- camps, hideouts, ruins
- places with cover to close distance

Strengths

- efficient guard breaks
- navigating tight combat spaces
- reliable stagger control
- reading enemy patterns
- surviving against physical threats

Drawbacks

- weak in open fields
- poor ranged threat
- low AoE control in outdoor clusters

---

1.6 GROUP ROLE — DUNGEONS & PARTY PLAY

Mercenary contributes:

- constant melee pressure
- reliable stagger and guard-break tools
- finishing power on elites
- defensive utility for trading

- controlled burst at Momentum thresholds
- execution-heavy kill cycles
- excellent single-target
- minimal AoE
- no magical scaling
- tactical, not chaotic

---

## SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS & MOMENTUM ENGINE

The Mercenary’s mechanics revolve around reading openings, breaking guards, applying stagger, and building Momentum for controlled finishing windows. Unlike burst assassins, the Mercenary does not spike instantly; their power ramps through proper sequencing of blows and tactical timing.

Everything ties into four engines:

1. Momentum Engine — controlled burst window system
2. Guard-Break Engine — stagger and opening creation
3. Execution Engine — finishing damage logic
4. Trading Engine — sustained DPS and defensive conversion

These define Mercenary gameplay at all levels.

---

2.0 — MECHANICAL OVERVIEW

Mercenary combat is deliberate, grounded, and timing-based.

Their power increases through:

- trading blows efficiently
- staggering enemies
- breaking guards
- chaining strikes in proper sequences
- maintaining pressure inside melee range
- triggering Momentum thresholds
- capitalizing on weakened targets
- executing opponents at the right moment

Mercenaries reach peak power when:

- Momentum ≥ 60 (pressure tier)
- Momentum ≥ 80 (finisher tier)
- guard is broken
- stagger is applied
- the enemy is below execution threshold
- they maintain trading consistency

Mercenary damage is stable early, grows mid-combat, and peaks in finishing windows.

---

2.1 — MOMENTUM ENGINE

Momentum is the Mercenary’s core mechanic.

It builds through correct combat behavior and creates controlled burst windows.

Momentum gain sources:

- landing weapon strikes
- staggering targets
- breaking guard
- interrupting enemy windups
- taking hits while braced
- applying Trauma effects
- finishing combos
- trading damage successfully

Momentum does not come from:

- random crits
- passive generation
- ranged poking
- missing attacks
- kiting or fleeing

Momentum Tiers

0–39 — Baseline

- no bonuses
- mild sustain from proper trading

40–59 — Pressure Tier

- light bonus to stagger duration
- improved guard-break strength
- minor damage amplification to consecutive hits (non-scaling)

60–79 — Controlled Burst Tier

- access to advanced combo finishers
- improved Trauma effectiveness
- enhanced guard-break impact
- staggered enemies take slightly increased damage from follow-up strikes
- certain skills gain secondary effects

80–100 — Execution Tier

- finishing power increased significantly
- Trauma bleeds intensify
- execution abilities gain bonus damage
- stagger → finisher windows become lethal
- Momentum rapidly decays after execution use

Momentum Decay

Out of combat:

- 6 Momentum per 3 seconds

In combat (not trading):

- 5 Momentum per 6 seconds

Decay pauses when:

- landing strikes
- applying stagger
- performing guard-break
- using finishers
- bracing correctly

---

2.2 — GUARD-BREAK ENGINE

Mercenaries excel at breaking defensive stances.

Guard-breaks create openings for burst without relying on random crits.

Guard-break rules:

- triggered by specific abilities
- amplified by Momentum tier
- certain weapons have inherent break strength
- breaks can interrupt windups
- breaking guard applies a brief stagger
- stagger duration increased in Pressure and Burst tiers

Guard-break effects:

- removes defensive mitigation
- increases incoming damage from consecutive strikes
- sets up stagger → finisher chains
- grants Momentum
- resets certain cooldowns in Execution tier
- creates the Mercenary’s primary window for burst

Stagger

- short, non-CC movement disruption
- increases vulnerability to finishers
- stagger duration extended at higher Momentum tiers
- stagger cannot exceed internal caps
- stagger does not function as a hard stun

---

2.3 — EXECUTION ENGINE

Execution is the Mercenary’s identity-defining payoff.

It is NOT a one-shot.

It is a controlled damage window that rewards timing.

Execution triggers when:

- Momentum ≥ 80
- target HP ≤ execution threshold
- guard recently broken
- stagger recently applied

Execution Window

- lasts 4 seconds
- finishers gain bonus scaling
- Trauma effects intensify during window
- consecutive hits gain mild amplification

Execution Threshold

Base: target below 20% HP

Talents may raise threshold to a maximum of 30%

Execution Effects

- finisher damage increased
- Trauma bleed potency increased
- guard-break cooldown reduced
- Momentum consumed by 80
- triggers post-execution recoil (brief self-slow)
- Momentum cannot exceed 50 immediately after execution, preventing chain abuse

---

2.4 — TRADING ENGINE

Mercenary trading is the loop that ties everything together.

Trading bonuses are active when:

- Mercenary is in melee range
- both combatants are exchanging blows
- the Mercenary is not stunned, disarmed, or kited
- Momentum tier ≥ 40

Trading benefits:

- small DR during consecutive hits
- minor health return on stagger hits
- Momentum sustained
- Trauma buildup accelerated

Trading downsides:

- weak when being kited
- weak at range
- reliant on constant uptime
- trading tools do not stack with plate-armor mitigation
- not a tank replacement

Trading is the Mercenary’s consistency engine, not a burst multiplier.

---

2.5 — TRAUMA & BLEED INTERACTIONS

Trauma is the Mercenary’s controlled-damage DOT effect.

Trauma is applied by:

- specific strikes
- combo finishers
- stagger-critical hits
- execution windows
- certain weapons (axes, daggers)

Trauma rules:

- deals physical damage over time
- scaling based on Weapon Power
- intensified during Execution tier
- does not stack infinitely
- capped at 3 stacks by default
- each stack has individual duration
- cannot exceed internal bleed caps
- never acts as a burst nuke
- applied deliberately, not through spam

---

2.6 — COMBO SYSTEM

Mercenary abilities follow a simple but strict combo logic:

- Opener → Builder → Breaker → Finisher
- Each stage has specific skills tied to it
- Only one of each type can be used in a chain
- Combo reset on whiff, CC, or Momentum decay
- Combos generate Momentum and Trauma when executed properly
- Executions are separate from combos, not the same system

Combos reward:

- maintaining pressure
- reading enemy actions
- timing guard-breaks
- using stagger windows

Combos punish:

- rushing
- spamming buttons
- random crit reliance
- attempting to burst at wrong time

---

2.7 — DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUE SYSTEM

Mercenaries survive through technique, not armor.

Defensive tools include:

- brace stance (short DR window)
- parry strike (small retaliation hit)
- controlled footwork
- self-stabilizing grit (passive mitigation)
- stagger prevention when Momentum < 20
- brief DR after a successful guard-break

Defensive technique scaling:

- slight increase with Strength
- slight increase with Momentum
- unaffected by heavy armor
- no magical mitigation

SECTION 6 — CLASS SYSTEMS & AI INTERACTION

Mercenary — Momentum Engine / Stagger Engine / Guard-Break Engine / Execution Engine

These rules define exactly how the combat engine and NPCs interact with Mercenaries.

---

6.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Mercenary gameplay is governed by:

1. Momentum Engine — builds toward burst windows
2. Guard-Break Engine — creates openings
3. Execution Engine — controlled finishing power
4. Trading Engine — sustained melee presence

These systems ensure:

- stagger → combo → finisher loops
- trading builds most of the damage
- execution is not instant but powerful
- spacing and timing matter
- ranged fights remain the weakness

---

6.1 MOMENTUM ENGINE — DETAILED COMBAT LOGIC

Momentum gain:

- +2 to +8 per basic strike
- +10 from Break Guard
- +6 to +10 from stagger
- +5 to +8 from Trauma upkeep
- +0 when missing
- +0 when fleeing
- +0 from random crits
- +0 from ranged hits

Momentum thresholds:

40+ → Pressure Tier

60+ → Controlled Burst Tier

80+ → Execution Tier

Rules:

- Momentum caps at 100
- cannot exceed 50 immediately after a finisher
- decays quickly out of combat
- pauses at low HP during execution prep
- Momentum Surge cannot raise you into Execution Tier

---

6.2 GUARD-BREAK ENGINE

Guard-break rules:

- Break Guard always staggers the target
- stagger duration improved by Momentum tier
- guard-break weakens enemy mitigation
- guard-break → finisher chains are core identity
- stagger is not a stun
- stagger does not interrupt instant abilities
- stagger cannot be stacked infinitely
- stagger has internal cooldowns for bosses

---

6.3 EXECUTION ENGINE

Execution triggers require:

- Momentum ≥ 80
- target HP ≤ 20–30% (depending on talents)
- stagger or recent guard-break
- melee range

Execution bonuses:

- finisher damage up
- Trauma intensified
- guard-break cooldown reduced
- Momentum consumed
- Trauma rupture when appropriate

Execution prevention logic (AI/boss fairness):

- bosses cannot be instantly killed
- bosses take increased finisher damage but not lethal multipliers
- AI attempts to dodge or mitigate execution windows

---

6.4 TRADING ENGINE

Rules:

- live trading grants DR and sustain
- kiting breaks the trading loop
- taking damage while Braced grants Momentum
- stagger on the enemy reinforces trading dominance
- trading does not produce burst abuse

---

6.5 TRAUMA ENGINE

Trauma scaling:

- physical bleed only
- 3-stack baseline cap
- finite duration
- intensifies in execution windows
- cannot stack infinitely with talents
- bosses resist Trauma slightly
- AI favors avoiding prolonged Trauma

---

6.6 AI INTERACTION — MERCENARY AS ENEMY

Melee AI:

- tries to bait out Brace
- attempts to deny stagger chains
- punishes heavy recovery windows
- avoids stagger radius when wounded

Ranged AI:

- kites aggressively
- stays outside Mercenary burst range
- interrupts Momentum generation
- uses slows to break trading loop

Boss AI:

- resists staggers at diminishing returns
- breaks combos with predictable patterns
- steps out of execution arcs
- attacks during Momentum decay windows

---

6.7 AI INTERACTION — MERCENARY AS ALLY

Allies behave as follows:

- tanks hold targets still for stagger chains
- healers maintain Mercenary during execution prep
- ranged allies avoid knocking enemies out of arcs
- casters avoid conflicting CC that cancels stagger windows

---

6.8 EDGE CASES & SPECIAL RULESETS

If Mercenary is stunned:

- Momentum generation halts
- Trauma continues ticking
- stagger cannot be applied
- Brace cannot be activated

If disarmed:

- basic strikes deal reduced damage
- Momentum gain reduced by 50%

If slowed severely:

- trading loop weakens
- ranged disadvantage worsens

---

6.9 EXECUTION TIER WINDOW LOGIC

Execution window lasts 4 seconds.

During this window:

- staggered enemies take extra rupture damage
- Trauma can be consumed for amplified effect
- Momentum rapidly drains post-finisher
- certain talents refund Momentum
- Mercenary becomes lethal, but only with proper setup

SEGMENT 8 — SECTIONS 7, 8 & 9: VISUAL IDENTITY, META, BUILDS, ROLE SUMMARY

CLASS: MERCENARY

(Final Segment — completes the full Priest-format Class Bible)

---

SECTION 7 — VISUAL, AUDIO & ANIMATION IDENTITY

Mercenary — Grounded Steel / Brutal Precision / Zero Magic

---

7.1 VISUAL IDENTITY

Mercenary visual fantasy is defined by realism, grit, and practiced lethality.

No magic.

No flashy effects.

Everything is grounded in steel, sweat, and technique.

Aesthetic Themes

- scarred steel
- worn leather and chain
- muted browns, grays, reds
- minimal ornamentation
- utilitarian gear
- weapon-weight realism
- raw, grounded violence

Silhouette

- medium armor silhouette
- visible straps, buckles, tactical rigging
- blade or axe always visible
- stance low, ready, disciplined

Weapon Visuals

- blades bite deeply, with metal-on-bone flashes
- trauma cuts leave faint red marks
- finishers have heavy, real-world weight
- guard-breaks have small dust shockwaves, not magic

Stagger Visuals

- quick body recoil
- small jolt or step backward
- no stun rings or fantasy particles

Momentum Visuals

- subtle rising tension
- stance tightens
- muscles coil
- slight red tint on weapons as tiers increase
- Execution Tier has faint breath-vapor intensity

---

7.2 ANIMATION THEMES

Mercenary animations are grounded and realistic:

Movement

- low center of gravity
- steps planted and deliberate
- pivots during stagger windows
- weight shifts during finisher windups

Strike Animations

- heavy swings use full torso
- parry strike uses shoulder + wrist torque
- Twin Strikes are quick, brutal chops
- guard-break uses aggressive forward drive

Execution Animations

- Crashing Blow: overhead commitment
- Guillotine: diagonal, deep cleaving arc
- Heartstopper: short, explosive thrust
- Executioner’s Verdict: massive, decisive sweep

Momentum Tier Animations

- slight stance widening
- audible breath control
- arms loosen for faster follow-through

---

7.3 AUDIO IDENTITY

Mercenary audio style is pure grounded brutality:

Hits

- steel-on-flesh thumps
- metal scraping bone
- chain and leather rattle
- deep blunt impacts for finishers

Stagger

- short grunt
- foot skid
- dull chest hit sound

Trauma

- wet, slicing sound
- faint tearing effect (low volume)

Execution

- loud, weighty steel sweep
- compressed air movement
- meaty impact
- short shockwave for Verdict cone

No magic sounds.

Everything is physical, direct, and violent.
