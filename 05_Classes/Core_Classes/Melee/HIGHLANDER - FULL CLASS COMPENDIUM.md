# HIGHLANDER — FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

# SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

## 1.1 CLASS FANTASY

The Highlander is Emberwild’s heavy-armored defender —

a stoic mountain-born sentinel who exchanges magic, rage, or finesse for:

- raw strength
- endurance
- controlled blocking
- positional anchoring
- disciplined melee trading
- protective morale auras
- tactical defense windows

This is not a paladin.

Not a berserker.

Not a magical knight.

The Highlander is a grounded, Classic-WoW-style heavy physical tank built on:

- armor
- shield mastery
- bracing techniques
- controlled power swings
- battlefield formation

Identity Pillars:

- Stand your ground
- Armor over fury
- Discipline over emotion
- Protection over aggression
- Stamina management over cooldown spam

The Highlander excels in:

- boss tanking
- elite duels
- holding chokepoints
- absorbing burst damage
- protecting allies
- mitigating physical threats

The Highlander struggles in:

- magic-heavy environments
- long-range kiting
- fights requiring high mobility
- multi-target damage output

Grounded. Realistic. The world’s “shield wall.”

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

Primary Role:

- Tank / Protector

Secondary Role:

- Control & Single-target Melee Pressure

Combat Profile:

- strongest physical mitigation in the game
- reliable block mechanics
- strong brace windows
- high endurance (Vitality)
- consistent but low DPS
- strong aggro tools
- heavy armor scaling
- realistic shield logic

Weaknesses:

- low mobility
- low magic resist
- slow attack pace
- reliant on uptime
- vulnerable when flanked
- requires positional skill

Damage Shape:

- slow, heavy, controlled blows
- low burst
- steady sustained damage
- some bleeds
- mitigation-based counter-attacks

The Highlander is the polar opposite of Seaborn/Pirate —

slow, patient, unbreakable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES

Armor:

✔ Cloth — Level 1

✔ Leather — Level 1

✔ Mail — Level 1

✔ Plate — Unlock at level 40

✔ Shields — Core to class

Never allowed:

✖ Wands

✖ Guns

✖ Bows

✖ Crossbows

✖ Orbs or magical implements

✖ Throwing weapons (except training javelin)

One-Handed:

✔ 1H Swords

✔ 1H Axes

✔ 1H Maces (blunt, war hammers)

✔ 1H Polearm Spearheads (short polearms)

✔ 2H Maces

✔ 2H Polearms (halberds, spears)

✔ Staves (martial only)

Forbidden:

❌ Daggers

❌ Fist Weapons

❌ Dual wield (Highlander never dual-wields)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.4 RESOURCE — VITALITY (PRIMARY AND ONLY)

Highlander uses pure Vitality:

Vitality powers:

- shield blocks
- braces
- power swings
- counters
- shouts
- taunts
- defensive stances

Vitality Regen:

- high outside combat
- low inside combat
- block & armor reduce your regen (tanky realism)
- talents add regen tied to discipline and morale

NO rage.

NO mana.

NO focus.

NO magic.

Pure stamina + discipline.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.5 SPECIAL MECHANIC — GUARD & BLOCK SYSTEM

Highlander’s unique system:

### Block Value

Your Shield + Strength + Armor type determine how many points of physical damage you block per hit.

### Block Chance

Determined by:

- Shield skill
- Stance
- Agility
- Talents

### Brace State (short buff)

Entering Brace gives:

- X% damage reduction
- Boosted Block Value
- Reduced movement
- Lasts 3–5 seconds
- Costs Vitality
- Cooldown based

This is your “Shield Wall” analogue — NOT magical, totally physical.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.6 EXPLORATION & WORLD UTILITY

Highlander excels at:

- climbing rocky terrain
- resisting cold environments
- pushing heavy obstacles
- creating improvised barriers
- enduring weather
- breaking weak barriers (doors, barricades)

They do not track enemies like Hunters.

They do not sense spirits like Witches.

They do not stealth.

They endure.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.7 GROUP ROLE (DUNGEONS & WORLD)

Highlander contributes:

- highest physical tanking
- strong threat generation
- reliable block/damage reduction
- ally-protecting shouts
- high uptime
- consistent aggro
- single-target lockdown

Weaknesses:

- bad AoE threat
- slow move speed
- weak vs casters
- low self-healing (only grit/discipline-based)

A true Classic tank, not a modern hybrid.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1.8 DAMAGE PROFILE & SCALING

Damage Sources:

1. Heavy melee autos
2. Shield Bash / shield-based strikes
3. Power swings
4. Counter-attacks
5. Bleeds from blunt trauma
6. Stance-enhanced hits

Primary scaling stats:

- Strength (main stat)
- Armor (amplifies block system)
- Vitality regen (talents)
- Shield Skill
- Weapon Skill
- Stamina/Vitality

Damage shape:

- extremely low burst
- slow attacks
- consistent
- high threat
- control-centric

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS

## 2.0 OVERVIEW

Highlander’s internal engine:

1. Guard & Block System
2. Brace (temporary DR window)
3. Shield Mastery (bash, stagger, block scaling)
4. Armor Scaling (heavy armor dominance)
5. Morale Shouts (small, Classic-style buffs)
6. Vitality Management
7. Aggro Mechanics (Threat generation)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2.1 BLOCK SYSTEM (DETAILED)

### Block Chance Formula (baseline):

```
Base Block Chance = Shield Skill × 0.15%
+ Agility × 0.05%
+ Shield Type Modifier
+ Stance Bonus
```

### Block Value Formula (baseline):

```
Block Value = Shield Armor × 0.65
+ Strength × 0.4
+ Stance Bonus
```

Block caps apply (Classic style).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2.2 BRACE SYSTEM

Brace is the Highlander’s signature:

### Brace (Rank 1) example numbers:

- Cost: 30 Vitality
- Duration: 3 sec
- Damage Taken: –25%
- Block Value: +20%
- Movement: –60%
- Cooldown: 20 sec

Higher ranks improve DR and Block Value.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2.3 SHIELD MASTERY

Shield-based abilities:

- Shield Bash (threat + interrupt)
- Shield Slam (armor crush)
- Defender’s Wall (brace combo)

PvE only stun windows (0.5–1.0 sec) allowed on heavier bashes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2.4 MORALE SHOUTS

Classic-WoW style physical shouts:

- small group buffs
- NOT magical
- short duration
- cost Vitality
- moderate cooldowns

Types:

- Battle Shout (AP)
- Hold the Line (armor)
- Defy Pain (damage taken reduction)
- Taunt (threat spike)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2.5 VITALITY ECONOMY

Highlander ability costs:

- Light attack: 10–15
- Bash/Shield hits: 15–20
- Heavy swings: 25–35
- Shouts: 20–30
- Brace: 30
- Finishers: 40–55

Vitality regen is intentionally lower in combat than Seaborn/Mercenary, reinforcing “slow tank” identity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2.6 THREAT SYSTEM

All Highlander heavy swings & shield attacks have threat multipliers, Classic WoW style.

Examples:

- Shield Bash: ×2.0 threat
- Armor Crush: ×1.5 threat
- Taunt: Forces 3 sec focus
- Heavy Swing: +20% threat baseline

Aggro is central to class role.
