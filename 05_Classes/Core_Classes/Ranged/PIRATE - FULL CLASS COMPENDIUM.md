# PIRATE — FULL CLASS COMPENDIUM

---

# SECTION 1 — CLASS OVERVIEW & IDENTITY

## 1.1 CLASS FANTASY

The Pirate is Emberwild’s mid-weight melee bruiser — a close-quarters fighter who lives on:

- sharp steel
- blunt force
- dirty tricks
- short bursts of toughness
- ruthless finishers

They are not disciplined soldiers or holy knights. Pirates grew up on docks, alleys, and decks, and fight the same way:

- no honor, just survival
- no magic, just steel, fist, rope, and black powder

Identity pillars:

- Brawling over form — wild swings, clinches, knees, kicks
- Dirty fighting over honor — eye jabs, groin kicks, sand tosses
- Pressure over patience — they stay in your face
- Short, brutal windows of toughness — brief braces, not full tanking
- Dual-wield flurries or 2H smashes — both are valid identities

Pirates thrive where fights are messy and close:

- ship decks
- narrow alleys
- taverns and basements
- cove tunnels
- cramped fortress corridors

They struggle where:

- ranged pressure dominates
- magic punishes melee
- long, sustained tanking is required

---

## 1.2 COMBAT IDENTITY

Primary Role:

- Melee DPS (Bruiser)

Secondary Role:

- Dirty fighting / soft control

Tertiary Role:

- Short off-tank in emergencies (briefly absorbing damage with Brace + talents, not full dungeon tank)

Combat profile:

- Solid sustained melee damage
- Bleeds and raw weapon damage, not magic
- Lots of short-duration control (stagger, blind, slow, interrupt)
- Strong executes on low-HP targets
- Can stabilize a pull for a few seconds with defensive tools
- Has pistols and thrown weapons for pulls / finishing, not as a ranged rotation

Weaknesses:

- Little to no AoE until mid/late game
- No ranged rotations; must be in melee to do real damage
- Weak vs magic-heavy enemies and kiting casters
- Cannot main tank — tools are tuned for survival and brief off-tank moments

---

## 1.3 ARMOR & WEAPON PROFICIENCIES

### Armor Progression

- Cloth — Level 1
- Leather — Level 1 (Pirates start in Leather)
- Mail — Trainable via class quest / trainer around Level 40
- Never Plate
- Never Shields

Pirates are tough but not armored knights. They rely on leather/mail plus Vitality and short defensive skills, not shield walls.

---

### Weapon Proficiencies (Using Standard Emberwild Terms)

One-Handed Weapons

- One-Handed Swords
- One-Handed Axes
- One-Handed Maces
- Daggers
- Fist Weapons

Two-Handed Weapons

- Two-Handed Swords
- Two-Handed Axes
- Two-Handed Maces
- Polearms

Ranged & Thrown

- Guns (pistols / crude muskets)
- Thrown Weapons
    - Throwing Knives
    - Throwing Axes
    - Javelins

Never Allowed

- Bows
- Crossbows
- Wands
- Staves
- Spellbooks / tomes
- Magic focuses of any kind

---

### Weapon Role

- Dual-wield 1H = fast pressure, bleeds, frequent crits
- 2H = heavier hits, executes, short off-tank bruiser
- Guns/Thrown = pulling, slowing, finishing, not sustained ranged DPS

Weapon trainers follow global rules: Pirates start with a small subset, and must pay trainers in major hubs to unlock additional weapon families (Classic-style).

---

## 1.4 RESOURCE — VITALITY (ONLY)

Pirate uses Vitality as its single resource.

- Base: ~100 Vitality (scaled by Stamina)
- Out-of-combat regen: high
- In-combat regen: moderate
- Light attacks: 8–15 Vitality cost
- Heavy finishers: 30–45
- Defensive tools: 15–25

Vitality represents:

- lung capacity
- muscle stamina
- willingness to keep swinging

There is no rage, no mana, no secondary bar. Abilities are tuned so that:

- spamming heavy moves will gas you out
- mixing jabs, slashes, and timed finishers keeps your flow stable

---

## 1.5 EXPLORATION & NON-COMBAT IDENTITY

Pirates are good at:

- spotting weak beams, rotten boards, brittle ropes
- finding hidden stashes in coastal / dock / tavern / cove areas
- noticing ambush positions in alleys and decks
- moving on sloped wooden surfaces with less slip penalty
- intimidating certain NPCs into giving up information or lowering prices (rep/lore dependent)

Outside combat, Pirate is the street and dock rat, good at reading where people hide goods or plan ambushes.

---

## 1.6 GROUP ROLE (DUNGEONS & OPEN WORLD)

In group content, Pirates:

- Provide consistent melee DPS
- Offer interrupts, blinds, staggers, slows to help the group survive
- Can briefly take hits when a tank stumbles (Brace + some Mariner talents)
- Peel dangerous enemies off low-HP allies with short control + burst
- Use pistols/throws to handle runners or pull enemies cleanly

They are not:

- primary tanks
- ranged anchor points
- healers
- AoE nukers

They shine in:

- tight corridors
- ship interiors
- humanoid-dense dungeons
- boss fights requiring frequent interrupts and staggers

---

## 1.7 DAMAGE PROFILE & SCALING

### Core Damage Sources

1. Weapon white damage (auto attacks)
2. Bleed effects (Gutter Slash and related abilities)
3. Heavy single-target strikes (axes, maces, 2H weapons)
4. Dirty Fighting damage (Pommel, Kick, etc. — modest but important)
5. Execute abilities (Keelhauler Slash, Throat Cutter at higher levels)
6. Utility ranged hits (Pistol Shot / Throwing Axe, etc.)

### Primary Scaling Stats

- Strength — main damage scaling stat
- Stamina — HP + Vitality pool
- Agility — crit + dodge
- Hit Chance — prevents whiffs vs higher-level enemies
- Weapon Skill — interacts with glancing blows / miss math at high levels

### Damage Shape

- Medium-high sustained damage (good over time)
- High pressure once bleeds are rolling
- Strong execute finishes on low-HP targets
- Damage drops sharply if kited or pushed out of melee for long
- AoE is limited and usually tied to heavy 2H swings / later talents

---

# SECTION 2 — CORE MECHANICS & CLASS SYSTEMS

## 2.0 OVERVIEW

The Pirate class engine is built from six grounded systems:

1. Brawler Chain Attacks — quick light hits into heavier follow-ups
2. Bleed & Pressure System — slashes that keep enemies “leaking”
3. Dirty Fighting — eye attacks, groin kicks, blinds, staggers
4. Firearms & Thrown Utility — simple pulling, slowing, finishing at range
5. Vitality Economy — stamina style resource management
6. Execution Thresholds — big finishers that come online under certain HP %

No combo points, no supernatural auras. Just stamina, timing, and brutality.

---

## 2.1 BRAWLER CHAINS

Brawler chains are loose, not hard-coded combos. The class is designed to reward good sequencing, not enforce it.

Example:

- Light opener (Jab) →
- Bleed (Gutter Slash) →
- Dirty control (Pommel / Kick) →
- Heavy strike or execute (Keelhauler / Throat Cutter)

Each move has:

- a Vitality cost
- a clear physical effect
- synergy when used in reasonable sequences

Players who learn to:

- open cheaply
- apply bleeds
- then spend Vitality on well-timed heavy hits
    
    do more DPS and survive better.
    

---

## 2.2 BLEED & PRESSURE SYSTEM

Bleeds are core to Pirate identity.

- Gutter Slash and similar abilities cause bleeds
- Bleeds:
    - tick every 2 seconds
    - stack or refresh depending on talents
    - pressure enemies in long fights
- Some talents:
    - increase bleed crit chance
    - cause instant extra ticks on application
    - convert bleed damage into minor self-healing

This is built to feel like a Classic bleed spec: simple to understand, high value over time.

---

## 2.3 DIRTY FIGHTING SYSTEM

Dirty abilities:

- Pommel Strike — stagger + small damage
- Kick — short disorient + interrupt
- Muck Throw — accuracy debuff
- Groin Kick / Eye Jabs / etc. — short stuns/slows

Rules:

- All of them cost Vitality
- Most do modest damage
- They are mainly for:
    - surviving
    - peeling
    - locking down casters
    - buying time for Brace / healer / repositioning

Some talents significantly deepen this:

- longer crowd control
- overlapping debuffs (damage down, reduced hit, etc.)
- better personal DR while enemies are controlled

---

## 2.4 FIREARMS & THROWN UTILITY

Firearms & thrown attacks are never a full rotation; they’re just tools.

- Pistol Shot — medium range, moderate damage, sometimes small knockback
- Throwing Knife — light damage, short slow
- Throwing Axe — higher damage, stronger slow

Rules:

- Cost Vitality, not a special resource
- Limited by cooldowns
- Used to:
    - pull single enemies
    - slow runners
    - add a little ranged presence on mechanics
    - finish fleeing targets

No ammo micromanagement beyond item type (and global item rules).

---

## 2.5 VITALITY ECONOMY (PIRATE-SPECIFIC)

General rules:

- Light attacks (Jab, low-rank slash): 8–14 Vitality
- Bleeds: 18–24 Vitality
- Dirty Fighting: 15–22 Vitality
- Heavy 2H swings: 25–35 Vitality
- Executes: 40–45 Vitality
- Defensives (Brace, Counterstance): 18–25 Vitality

If you:

- spam big finishers without lighter moves → you burn dry and stand there
- mix light/medium attacks → you maintain sustained output like a Classic melee class

---

## 2.6 EXECUTION LOGIC

Executes are available under a HP threshold:

- Keelhauler Slash — 30% HP
- Throat Cutter — 25% HP

Execution rules:

- Huge base damage scaling with weapon and Strength
- High crit chance baked in
- Long cooldowns or high Vitality costs (not rotational fillers)

They’re designed to feel nasty and satisfying, but punishing if used badly or whiffed.

---

# SECTION 6 — SYSTEMS & AI INTERACTIONS

- Humanoid enemies:
    - strongly affected by Dirty Fighting (stuns, disorients)
    - sometimes “terrified” briefly when you execute an ally with Throat Cutter (small fear / hesitation)
- Beasts:
    - less affected by Groin Kick, more by raw stagger
    - bleed scaling is strong vs beasts
- Constructs:
    - immune to disorient and blind (Kick/Muck Throw still do damage, no CC)
- Casters:
    - Kick & Pommel interrupts are crucial
    - Muck Throw reduces hit/accuracy

AI reaction:

- Enemies may switch to you if you use heavy executes or repeated Dirty Fighting on their allies.
- In some encounters, repeatedly blinding/staggering can cause AI to:
    - back off
    - use a “strong attack” with warning animation
