# Class Kit Template (Classic MMO Style)

Use this template to draft or refactor a class into a classic, role-driven design. Keep abilities lean, emphasize resource pacing, and show how the class levels from 1–60.

## Fantasy & Role
- **Fantasy hook:** (What fantasy or archetype anchors the class?)
- **Primary roles:** (Tank / Healer / Melee DPS / Ranged DPS / Support.)
- **Resource model:** (Rage, Energy/Combo Points, Mana, Ammo, etc.)
- **Armor/weapon proficiencies:** (Armor tiers, weapon groups, off-hands, shields.)

## Core Play Loop
- **Baseline rotation (levels 1–20):** (Starter builder/spender or threat/heal loop.)
- **Mid-game pivot (20–40):** (New mechanic unlocks, stance/forms, key cooldowns.)
- **End-game cadence (40–60):** (Raid utility, burst windows, mitigation/heal cadence.)
- **Positional/kit constraints:** (Flanking, channeling, stance upkeep, ammo costs.)

## Ability Ladder
| Level Band | Abilities/Upgrades | Purpose & Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–10 |  | (Openers, sustain tools, intro crowd control.) |
| 11–20 |  | (Early specialization hints, mobility, interrupts.) |
| 21–30 |  | (Core cooldowns, defensive layers, resource tweaks.) |
| 31–40 |  | (Group utility, debuff coverage, secondary role enablers.) |
| 41–50 |  | (Burst/survival breakers, resist/element hooks.) |
| 51–60 |  | (Capstone gameplay, raid buffs, encounter-specific tech.) |

## Talent/Specialization Hooks
- **Spec themes:** (e.g., Threat Juggernaut / Control Warden / Support Marshal.)
- **Throughlines:** (What stays consistent across specs—resource, weapon, armor.)
- **Mutual exclusivity:** (Talents that shape playstyle; avoid bloat.)
- **Synergy targets:** (Which systems/skills or professions pair well.)

## Utility & Group Value
- Party/raid buffs and debuffs (target caps, durations, stacking rules).
- Dispel types provided/required; resist auras; threat or regen tools.
- Mobility/transport (mount perks, portals, gap closers, speed buffs).

## Progression & Quest Content
- **Class quests:** (Mount/companion unlocks, weapon attunements, faction choices.)
- **Key rewards:** (Blueprints, totems, stance items, relics.)
- **Dungeon/raid hooks:** (Where the class shines or provides mandatory coverage.)

## Gearing & Economy
- Stat priorities across level bands; crafted pre-raid sets; notable drops.
- Profession ties (e.g., weapon oils, ammo crafting, potion dependence).
- Ammo/consumable expectations and upkeep costs.

## Tuning Notes
- Target DPS/HPS/threat envelopes by tier; mitigation expectations for tanks.
- Cooldown budgets (number of majors/minors); crowd-control limits and DRs.
- PvP knobs (snare durations, burst windows, counterplay hooks).

## Open Questions
- (List decisions to resolve: animation needs, resource numbers, new keywords.)
