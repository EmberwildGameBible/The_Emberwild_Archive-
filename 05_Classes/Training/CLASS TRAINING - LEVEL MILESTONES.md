# CLASS TRAINING - LEVEL MILESTONES

Classic-style trainer pacing so every 2–4 levels feel meaningful. Use alongside each class kit to plot spell ranks, utility unlocks, and travel to trainers.

## TRAINER RULES OF THUMB
- **Gold pressure:** Early ranks are cheap; travel costs and weapon skills are the pinch points. Expensive ranks start at level 16+.
- **Travel loops:** Each class has at least one trainer per continent; some advanced ranks require capital-city visits to encourage travel.
- **Breadth before depth:** Ranks are staggered so players try new buttons before upgrading old ones.
- **Weapon skills:** Keep “off-weapon” training available via distant trainers (e.g., Hunters learn polearms from coastal trainer at 14).

## MELEE ARCHETYPES (WARRIOR/ROGUE-STYLE)
| Level | Unlock | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Basic strike, auto-attack toggle | Starter weapon skill includes 1H + shield or dual-wield intro quest. |
| 4 | Taunt / Distract | Short-range control; sets early tank/support identity. |
| 6 | Defensive stance + block mastery | Adds mitigation layer; enables shield training quest. |
| 8 | Gap closer (Charge / Dash) | Costs stamina/energy; teaches opener pacing. |
| 10 | Interrupt (Kick / Shield Bash) | Trainer visit introduces first dungeon etiquette. |
| 12 | Bleed or poison dot | Pushes weapon choice; mild DoT for pacing. |
| 14 | Threat finisher or stealth opener | Branching choice based on role path. |
| 16 | Weapon specialization quest | Travel to remote trainer to learn polearm/axe skill. |
| 18 | Defensive cooldown (short) | 30–60s button to survive elite pulls. |
| 20 | Class quest: signature weapon | 2–3 step chain ending in blue-quality weapon tuned to role. |

## CASTER/HEALER ARCHETYPES (MAGE/PRIEST-STYLE)
| Level | Unlock | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Bolt/Nova + basic heal | Sets school identity and low-rank heal cadence. |
| 4 | Slow / snare | Kites melee threats; pairs with food/drink economy. |
| 6 | Shield / ward | Absorb or school ward; builds mana management habits. |
| 8 | AoE cone or small burst | Crowd tool that drains mana fast; cautions overpulling. |
| 10 | Dispel (ally/enemy) | Opens utility role in dungeons; trainer in capitals only. |
| 12 | Efficient heal rank | Emphasizes downranking and mana conservation. |
| 14 | Control (sheep/hex) | Single-target CC; 30–45s duration. |
| 16 | Mana regen cooldown | Evocation/Chant; long cooldown encourages planning. |
| 18 | Travel spell or portal breadcrumb | Starts portal network; requires reagent. |
| 20 | Class quest: robe or relic | Story beat with faction mentor; yields blue-quality focus item. |

## HYBRID/DRUID-STYLE ARCHETYPES
| Level | Unlock | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Melee strike + minor heal | Establishes form swapping basics. |
| 4 | Shapeshift/form #1 | Movement/utility form with small armor bonus. |
| 6 | HoT rank 1 | Introduces rolling heals for group play. |
| 8 | Ranged nuke or bow opener | Encourages hybrid gameplay; uses alternative resource. |
| 10 | Cleanse/decursing | Hybrid identity; makes them valuable in early dungeons. |
| 12 | Form #2 (tank or melee) | Unlock requires druidic grove trainer; travel milestone. |
| 14 | Form-specific finisher | Consumes combo/rage equivalents; teaches form synergy. |
| 16 | Group aura/totem | Short-range buff that stacks with basic food; encourages positioning. |
| 18 | Long cooldown utility | Battle rez or group sprint; long cooldowns reinforce stakes. |
| 20 | Class quest: form mastery | Multi-zone pilgrimage to attune forms; rewards improved shapeshift or relic. |

## TRAINER LOCATION IDEAS (EXAMPLES)
- **Capital mentors:** Highest rank trainers, portals, and class quest givers.
- **Frontier outposts:** Mid-rank trainers (levels 10–18) placed along leveling routes to reinforce travel loops.
- **Hidden specialists:** Weapon masters and form tutors tucked in dungeons/ruins; visiting them unlocks off-meta builds.

## HOW TO USE THIS
- Pair each class compendium with this table and mark exact level/rank names.
- Add travel notes to leveling routes so players naturally pass trainers.
- Gate key class quests (weapons/forms/portals) behind light grouping to echo classic social friction.
