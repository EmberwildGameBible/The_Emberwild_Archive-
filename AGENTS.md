# Repository Agent Rules

These rules guide content creation for The Emberwild Archive.

## Definition of Done (DoD) for any content batch
A batch is NOT done until:
- Every touched entity has an origin + 1 cultural tie + 1 gameplay hook.
- Every touched entity has 3 real cross-links (or stubs were created).
- Indexes updated (00_MASTER_INDEX) so the content is discoverable.
- “Lore debt” list updated for any placeholders.

## Depth Ladder (so you can crank volume without losing consistency)
- Depth-1 (Micro): 40–80 words total + 3 links.
- Depth-2 (Standard): Micro + 1 secondary artifact (rumor, ledger, recipe note, bounty blurb).
- Depth-3 (Rabbit Hole): Standard + 2–3 secondary artifacts + 1 named witness/voice.

Default to Depth-2 unless instructed otherwise.

## Secondary Artifacts Rule (mandatory)
Every entity must spawn at least ONE artifact *somewhere*:
- rumor scrap, bounty board entry, family recipe margin note, shipping ledger line,
  traveler warning sign, field guide note, prayer inscription, tavern menu footnote.

Artifacts must reference specific names/places already in the world.

## Tone & Prose Rules (classic MMO fantasy)
- Short paragraphs. Concrete nouns. Minimal purple prose.
- Treat lore like it’s written by locals: partial, biased, practical.
- Avoid “epic prophecy” unless it’s mainline.
- If uncertain, prefer superstition/folk explanation over omniscient truth.

## Continuity Rules
- Never contradict “hard canon” files (list them in 01_World/Canon_List.md).
- If you discover a contradiction, record it in 01_World/Continuity_Issues.md
  and resolve it with an in-world explanation (propaganda, regional dialect, old map error).

## Output Format (always)
- Summary (what you changed)
- Touched files list
- New files list
- Lore Debt added/removed
- “Next 3 best rabbit holes to deepen”
