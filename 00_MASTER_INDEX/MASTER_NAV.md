# Master Navigation

## Summary
A single launchpad for all Emberwild Archive indexes so no canon hides in stray folders. Follow the links here to jump into each category’s maintained index and keep every lore entry discoverable.

## Details
- Global canon: [World](../01_World) pillars are indexed through [Lore_Index](./Lore_Index.md), [Quests_Index](./Quests_Index.md), [Items_Index](./Items_Index.md), and [Systems_Index](./Systems_Index.md).
- Regional coverage: [Regions_Index](./Regions_Index.md) routes to travel hubs, hazards, and local notes without duplicating global entries.
- Supporting systems: [Classes_Index](./Classes_Index.md), [Dialogue_Index](./Dialogue_Index.md), [Writings_Index](./Writings_Index.md), and [Artifacts_Index](./Artifacts_Index.md) organize playable hooks and prose.

## Hooks
- Start audits from this nav before adding lore so every new page gains an index slot and cross-links back to canon.
- Use it to verify region pages point to global NPCs/items/quests instead of cloning them.
- Pair with [Repo Map](./REPO_MAP.md) when deciding where new files belong to avoid cleanup churn.
