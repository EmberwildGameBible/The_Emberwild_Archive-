# Artifacts Index

## Summary
Navigation for in-world documents—gazettes, rumor sheets, ledgers, and notices—so players and writers can trace leads without duplicating canon items or quests.

## Details
- Artifacts live in [09_Artifacts](../09_Artifacts) and reference global items, quests, and regions instead of re-stating them.
- Each entry below links to its source file plus the primary location it circulates through.
- Use the hooks to spot where artifacts can seed new quests or item drops without breaking single-source-of-truth rules.

## Hooks
- Pull kiln, ferry, or Silent Bell plot hooks from the Gazette before drafting new Emberford quests.
- Mine the rumor web for item-specific bounties, then link any new quests to the canonical [Items Master List](../08_Items/Items_Master_List%20-%20GLOBAL%20A-Z.md).
- Add future artifacts here before writing them to keep the folder structured and indexed.
