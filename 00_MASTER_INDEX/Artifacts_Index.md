# Artifacts Index

## Summary
Navigation for in-world documents—gazettes, rumor sheets, ledgers, and notices—so players and writers can trace leads without duplicating canon items or quests.

## Details
- Artifacts live in [09_Artifacts](../09_Artifacts) and reference global items, quests, and regions instead of re-stating them.
- Each entry below links to its source file plus the primary location it circulates through.
- Use the hooks to spot where artifacts can seed new quests or item drops without breaking single-source-of-truth rules.

- Add future artifacts here before writing them to keep the folder structured and indexed.

## See also
- [MASTER_NAV](./MASTER_NAV.md) — top-level navigation to all indexes.
- [Regions_Index](./Regions_Index.md) — where to slot new artifacts tied to a locale.
