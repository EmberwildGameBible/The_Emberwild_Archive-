# MASTER INDEX

## Summary
This folder keeps every navigation file that makes the Emberwild Archive browsable: master nav, repo map, and category indexes. Start here before adding or moving canon so nothing goes missing.

## Details
- Index files link into each major pillar: regions, lore, quests, items, systems, classes, dialogue, writings, and artifacts.
- Master tools like [MASTER_NAV](./MASTER_NAV.md) and [REPO_MAP](./REPO_MAP.md) prevent duplicate canon by pointing contributors to the right home.
- Keep this directory clean—add new index stubs here before drafting new content elsewhere.

## Hooks
- Use the indexes to verify every content file is reachable from a global or regional entry.
- When you reorganize files, update the navigation and map here first, then fix links in the referenced folders.
- Track pending cleanup work in [Lore_Debt](./Lore_Debt.md) as you discover gaps.
