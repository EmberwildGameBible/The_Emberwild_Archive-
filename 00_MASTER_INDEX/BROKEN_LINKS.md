# Broken Links Audit

Scan date: 2024-05-09.

No broken Markdown links detected in the Meta Lore rename set. Existing indexes in `10_Documentation/Indexes` list the retitled chapters as plain text; no path updates were required.

Planned follow-up: run a repo-wide link crawler to validate older Writings and GameBible references once filename normalization continues.
