# REPO_MAP

## Summary
A quick map of where every type of Emberwild canon lives so contributors file updates in the right home without duplicating lore.

## Details
- **Global Truths:** [01_World](../01_World) holds cosmology, history, and continuity tracking; [03_Lore](../03_Lore) covers creatures, magic, and phenomena.
- **Regional Content:** [02_Regions](../02_Regions) stores location-specific travel notes and POIs. Reference the zone index before adding local rumors or hazards.
- **Systems & Progression:** [05_Classes](../05_Classes), [06_Systems](../06_Systems), and [07_Quests](../07_Quests) define play loops, while [08_Items](../08_Items) and [09_Artifacts](../09_Artifacts) anchor drops and in-world documents.
- **Creative & Reference:** [04_Writings](../04_Writings) collects prose, and [10_Documentation](../10_Documentation) captures contributor guides and style standards.

## Hooks
- Use this map with the [Master Navigation](./MASTER_NAV.md) list when adding new entries to ensure every file lands in the correct category and index.
- When moving or renaming a file, copy the old→new path into a future `MOVED_RENAMED_LOG.md` section here for traceability.
- Check the map before creating regional variants—link back to the global item/quest/faction instead of forking it.
