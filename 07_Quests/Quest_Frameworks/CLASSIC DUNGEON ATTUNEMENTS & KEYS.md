# CLASSIC DUNGEON ATTUNEMENTS & KEYS

Classic WoW-style gates that make dungeons feel like world events—earn the key, meet the faction, travel the long road.

## QUICK INDEX
- Keyrings & Logistics — how keys, shards, and attunement flags work in Emberwild.
- Low-Level Keys (Lv 15–25) — starter wings and story hooks.
- Mid-Level Attunements (Lv 30–45) — faction, travel, and profession interplay.
- High-Level Attunements (Lv 50+) — raid gates, resistance checks, and epic prep.

## KEYRINGS & LOGISTICS
- **Keyring capacity:** 12 slots baseline; +3 from faction-friendly locksmiths at Revered.

- **Group rules:** Only 1 player in group needs the key to open; attuned players can bypass door bosses.
- **Reset & lockouts:** Weekly raid attunements persist; dungeon keys persist permanently but can be revoked on faction swap.
