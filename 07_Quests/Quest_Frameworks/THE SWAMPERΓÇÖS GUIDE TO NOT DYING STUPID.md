# THE SWAMPER’S GUIDE TO NOT DYING STUPID

*As Told by Greska Mudfinger to Her Daughter, Who Keeps Asking Foolish Questions*

## ON WHY WE DON’T TRUST CLEAR WATER

You want to know why your cousin Pelo drowned in three feet of water?

I’ll tell you.

He saw a pool. Clear as glass, still as death, reflecting the sky so perfect you’d think you could walk on it. He was thirsty—we’d been tracking a boar for six hours and his waterskin was empty.

I told him: “In the Rotfen, if you can see the bottom, something’s *wrong*.”

He didn’t listen. Thought I was being superstitious. Thought clear water meant *safe* water.

He knelt down. Cupped his hands. Leaned forward to drink.

The water wasn’t three feet deep.

It was thirty.

What he thought was the bottom? That was *sky*. Reflection of clouds. The pool was a throat leading straight down into the deep marsh, and the second his weight shifted forward, it swallowed him whole.

We got him out. Took four of us hauling on ropes. He survived, but he doesn’t track in the Rotfen anymore. Won’t even come within sight of the tree line.

**Swamper Rule #1:** Murky water tells you where the ground is. Clear water lies.

If you can see bottom clearly in the marsh, you’re looking at a reflection. The real bottom is twenty feet deeper, and by the time you figure that out, you’re already drowning.

## ON THE POLITENESS OF EATING WHAT YOU’RE OFFERED

When a Swamper invites you to eat, you eat.

Doesn’t matter if it looks wrong. Doesn’t matter if it smells like rotted bark. Doesn’t matter if you can’t identify a single ingredient on your plate.

You. Eat.

A Plainsfolk merchant came through Last Light Lodge three summers back. Nice enough fellow, good prices on driftwheat, seemed respectful. We invited him to stay for dinner as custom demands.

Old Marsh cooked. She made blackroot stew with dewcrab and creeping moss—standard fare, nothing fancy. The merchant took one look at his bowl and *wrinkled his nose*.

Didn’t say anything. Didn’t have to. We all saw it.

He picked at the stew. Ate maybe three bites. Kept smiling like he was doing us a favor by being polite.

When he left the next morning, his packs were lighter than they should’ve been. His waterskin had a slow leak he didn’t notice until he was two miles out. The trail he wanted to take—the fast one, the one that cuts three hours off the trip—well, someone forgot to mention that particular path washes out every afternoon when the tide comes in.

He made it out alive. Barely.

But he never came back.

**Swamper Rule #2:** If you insult our food, you insult our *water*. You insult our water, you insult our *land*. And if you insult our land, the land will remember.

We won’t kill you. We don’t have to. We’ll just stop telling you which paths are safe.

## ON DREAD GARLIC (AGAIN, BECAUSE APPARENTLY ONCE WASN’T ENOUGH)

Every year, some outsider dies because they don’t respect dread garlic.

Every. Single. Year.

It’s not the garlic that kills them. It’s the *arrogance*.

Dread garlic grows in the deep marsh where the water doesn’t move and the air tastes like iron. The bulbs are black-skinned, smell so strong they’ll make your eyes water from across a campsite. One clove—*one*—is enough to season a pot that feeds eight people.

Use two cloves? You’ll spend the night vomiting.

Use three? You’ll start seeing things that aren’t there.

Use a whole bulb? You’ll walk into the marsh and you won’t come back. Not because the garlic poisons you—though it will—but because it makes you *not care* that you’re walking into deep water. Makes you think the reflections are real. Makes you trust clear water.

I watched a man do it once. Hunter from the highlands, thought he knew better. Used half a bulb in his stew because he “liked bold flavors.”

He ate two bowls.

An hour later, he stood up, smiled at nothing, and walked straight into the marsh. Didn’t run. Didn’t panic. Just… walked. Like he was heading home.

We found his body three days later, face-down in a pool that wasn’t there when we’d made camp.

The dread garlic doesn’t want to kill you.

It just makes you forget why you shouldn’t die.

**Swamper Rule #3:** Respect what grows in dark water. It’s been here longer than you. It’ll be here after you’re gone. And if you’re stupid about it, it’ll make sure “after” comes *soon*.

## SWAMPER FEAST OF REMEMBRANCE *(The Sinking Night)*

We don’t celebrate births in the Rotfen. We celebrate *survivals*.

Once a year, on the longest night, every Swamper lodge lights lanterns and sets them floating on the water. One lantern for every person who died in the marsh that year.

Hunters who drowned. Foragers who ate the wrong mushroom. Children who wandered off the boardwalks. Elders who went into the deep water because they were tired of fighting.

We don’t mourn quietly. We *feast*.

**The Traditional Meal:**

- Blackroot stew (bitter, strong, impossible to prettify)
- Dewcrab boiled in ashbrine
- Bog onion roasted until it’s sweet
- Barkfenn herb tea (tastes like the marsh smells—earthy, wet, alive)
- Blackshore eel if anyone’s caught one (this is the centerpiece, the pride dish)

**Why We Feast:**

Because the dead aren’t coming back, and sitting around *sad* doesn’t honor them.

You know what honors them? *Living*. Eating. Laughing. Getting drunk on swamp cider and telling the stories about how stupid they were, how brave they were, how they died doing something that made sense at the time even if it looks insane in hindsight.

My brother drowned saving a dog. The dog lived. He didn’t.

Every Sinking Night, I tell that story. I tell it loud. I tell it until people laugh, because it *is* funny—not that he died, but that he made that choice. That he looked at a dog thrashing in deep water and thought, “Yeah, that’s worth it.”

And then I drink to him.

And then I eat blackshore eel, because he never got to taste it and someone should.

**The Lanterns:**

After the feast, we take the lanterns to the water. Each one has a name carved into the side—sometimes carved neat, sometimes scratched in desperate handwriting by someone who can barely see through tears.

We light them. We set them floating.

We watch them drift into the dark.

Some lodges sing. Some stay silent. My lodge tells jokes, because that’s what the dead would’ve wanted.

The lanterns burn for maybe an hour. Then they sink. The marsh takes them, same as it took the people they represent.

And we go back inside.

And we keep living.

**Swamper Rule #4:** The marsh will take you eventually. That’s not negotiable. But until it does, you eat well, you laugh hard, and you make damn sure that when your lantern floats, someone tells a good story about you.

## MUDBONES *(A Swamper Children’s Game That Teaches Survival)*

**What You Need:**

- 10 small bones (finger bones from fish or small game)
- A patch of soft mud
- 3–8 children (adults can play, but it’s meant for teaching the young)
- A blindfold

**How to Play:**

One child is the **Seeker**. Everyone else is a **Walker**.

The Walkers each take a bone and hide it somewhere in the mud patch—buried shallow, pressed into the surface, tucked under a root, whatever. They have one minute.

Then the Seeker is blindfolded.

**The Goal:** Find as many bones as you can using only your hands and feet. No sight. Just touch.

**The Lesson:**

In the Rotfen, you can’t always trust your eyes. Water lies. Reflections lie. Even the ground lies—what looks like solid earth might be floating moss over a sinkhole.

But your *hands* don’t lie. Your *feet* don’t lie.

This game teaches children to trust their sense of touch, to move carefully, to *feel* the difference between safe ground and dangerous ground.

The best Seekers don’t thrash around. They move slow. They test every step. They press gently into the mud and *listen* to what it tells them.

**Swamper Variant (For Older Children):**

Some bones are *marked*. If you find a marked bone, you have to stop playing immediately and sit down where you are. No moving. No warning the other Seekers.

This teaches you that sometimes, the thing you’re looking for is a *trap*. And if you’re not careful, you’ll find it.

**Adult Version (Played in Taverns, Usually Drunk):**

Same game, but the bones are replaced with *coins*. The mud is replaced with a barrel of swamp water. And instead of being blindfolded, you’re just too drunk to see straight.

Winner keeps all the coins they find.

Losers usually end up face-down in the barrel.

It’s a good time.

## A FINAL WARNING FOR OUTSIDERS

If you come to the Rotfen, we’ll feed you. We’ll give you a place to sleep. We’ll tell you which paths are safe and which ones aren’t.

But we won’t *save* you.

That’s not cruelty. That’s respect.

The marsh teaches. If you don’t listen, the lesson kills you. If we step in every time someone’s about to do something stupid, they never learn. They’ll just do something *more* stupid next time, in a place where we’re not around to help.

So we watch. We warn *once*. And then we let you make your choice.

Some people listen. They survive. They become Swampers, or at least they become *respectful*.

Some people don’t listen. They die. And on Sinking Night, we light a lantern for them anyway, because they were brave enough to try.

**The Swamper’s Oath** (Taught to Every Child):

*“The water will take you.*

*The dark will find you.*

*The land will test you.*

*And if you are weak, or stupid, or unlucky—*

*The marsh will keep you.*

*But until that day:*

*Walk careful.*

*Eat well.*

*And remember—*

*Clear water lies.”*

**[Marginal note, added in different ink]:**

*My daughter asked me why I’m so harsh about the rules.*

*I told her: “Because I want you to get old.”*

*She’s sixteen now. She walks the boardwalks without looking down. She tests the water before she drinks. She uses dread garlic properly.*

*She’ll outlive me.*

*That’s the point.*
