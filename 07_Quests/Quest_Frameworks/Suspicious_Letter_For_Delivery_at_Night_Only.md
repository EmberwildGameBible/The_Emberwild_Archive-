# Suspicious Letter — For Delivery at Night Only

*Left at a caravan rest point.*

Take the box to the old grain mill by the marsh crossing.

Don’t look inside.

Don’t ask questions.

Don’t talk to anyone on the way.

If someone follows you, leave the box and walk away.

Don’t try to be brave.

You won’t win.

Payment will be under the stone bench by morning.

— *R.*
