# Strandline Courier Loop

Repeatable courier run linking Tidecall Piers, Brineglass Flats, and Hookbite Lookout in the Saltmarrow Strand.

- Origin/Provenance: Organized by Quartermaster Lysa Pine after ferries began losing sealed bundles to sinkholes.
- Cultural tie: Dock crews treat the dusk loop as a rite; finishing without drops earns a notch on the courier’s brine token.
- Gameplay hook: Players ferry wax bundles, avoid sinkholes, and fire [Hookbite Signal Flares](../08_Items/Gear/Hookbite_Signal_Flares.md) when routes shift; rewards [Courier’s Brine Token](../08_Items/Trinkets/Couriers_Brine_Token.md) and saltmarrow bricks.
