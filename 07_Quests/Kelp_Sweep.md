# Kelp Sweep

Fishing patrol that clears Kelpback Shallows while gathering kelp fibers.

- Origin/Provenance: Called by Hookbite Lookout when kelp overgrowth snags ferry lines.
- Cultural tie: Crews chant short rhymes about “stray tide” luck while cutting kelp, passing knives down the line.
- Gameplay hook: Players harvest kelp, fend off [Kelpback Bulwark](../03_Lore/Creatures/Kelpback_Bulwark.md), and deliver [Kelpback Binding Straps](../08_Items/Crafting/Kelpback_Binding_Straps.md) to Joft.
