# Bracken Bridge Ambush

- Quest Giver: Smuggler Fixer Ril — Thornbar Bivouac Firepit
- Recommended Level: 6
- Prerequisites: Completion of Q03_Sapstring_Shortfall

## Acceptance Dialogue
- Ril twirls a soot-black quill. "Ellas thinks he's got me penned. I think he underestimates brambles."
- "Wardens keep marching torches across the bridge. They forget vines bite back."
- "If you cut the snares and leave thorn hooks, the wardens will limp for a week."
- "Bring me their chalk scraps; I'll sell them back after the storm." 
- "Don't touch the ash pit. That's my ledger." 
- "Run quiet. Fen listens for heavy boots." 

## Objectives
- Cut 8 snares around Chorus Bridge using Tanglecut Hatchet.
- Plant 4 Smuggler's Knot Hooks along Bracken Snare Ring.
- Steal 3 Ward-Chalk Packets from patrol crates near Sapstring Crossing.

- Bracken Snare Ring
- Sapstring Crossing

## Enemies / Targets

## Items Involved
- Tanglecut Hatchet
- Smuggler's Knot Hook

## Turn-in Dialogue
- "You cut them clean? Good. Watch the wardens dance now."
- "These hooks will keep my crews slipping past while Ellas files reports."
- "Chalk scraps? I'll stamp new routes."
- "Here's your pay. Spend it before Fen taxes it."
- "If the hum rises, blame the wind, not the ash." 
- "Next time, bring resin. The pit's running low."

## Artifact Tie
- Artifact_Bundle_03.md#a-030-bracken-snare-countermark

## Implementation Notes
- Place snare nodes near bridge ramps; use hatchet to disable.
- Smuggler's Knot Hooks consumed on planting; place at flagged vines around Bracken Snare Ring.
- Ward-Chalk Packets taken from patrol satchels; stealth reduces aggro radius.
- Quest fails if player kills more than five wardens; reset counter on abandon.
- Shared progress for group planting, individual credit for chalk theft.
