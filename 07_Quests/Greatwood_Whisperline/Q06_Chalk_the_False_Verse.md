# Chalk the False Verse
[Back to Hub](../Greatwood_Whisperline_Hub.md)

## Hook
Smugglers carved a false verse into Mirebreath Run, causing barkmail packs to attack wardens. Chant-Keeper Syl requests that you overwrite the verse before patrols fall.

## Objectives
1. Acquire **2026-01-04_SIGMA Rootbound Signal Chalk** and **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Signal Chalk** from **Wardscribe Istra**.
2. Track the chalk-smeared stones along Mirebreath Run using the hints from **RW-048**.
3. Overwrite three false glyphs; defend each point against barkmail strikers dropping **2026-01-04_SIGMA Barkmail Boots**.

## Where It Happens
- Mirebreath Run waterways and chalk stones.

## Rewards
- XP, coin, shrine favor.
- Items: **2026-01-04_SIGMA Wardbound Hood**, **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Ward Salve**.

## Ties
- Artifact: **2026-01-04_SIGMA_Whisperline_Artifact_30.md** (contains the original verse).
- Rumor: **RW-048**.

## Implementation Notes
- Chalk use consumes one unit per glyph; ensure players carry both chalk types before allowing interaction.
- Spawn barkmail mobs when first glyph interaction begins; drops should count toward quest even if player flees.
- Completing all three overwrites spawns Syl for a voice line that advances the chain.
