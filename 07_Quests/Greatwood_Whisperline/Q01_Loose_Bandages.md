# Loose Bandages on the Crossing

## Quest Giver
- Warden Quartermaster Ellas — Sapstring Crossing

## Recommended Level
- 2–4

## Prerequisites
- None

## Acceptance Dialogue
- Ellas wipes sap from his hands and squints. 
- "Those snares at **Bracken Snare Ring** tore more packs than we thought."
- "I need **Sapstring Bandages** and **Resin Patch Kits** before the next mule train."
- "The **Milepost Whisperer** keeps hinting at a hidden cache near the **Whisperline Milepost**."
- "Fetch what you can and mind the hook-runners; they like shiny buckles."
- "Bring the supplies back before dusk—I'm not patching straps blind." 

## Objectives
- Collect 4 **Sapstring Bandages** from caches near the **Whisperline Milepost**.
- Recover 2 **Resin Patch Kits** dropped at **Fallen Cart Bend**.
- Optional: Burn 3 snares at **Bracken Snare Ring** using **Chorus Bridge Torches**.

## Locations Used
- Whisperline Milepost
- Fallen Cart Bend
- Bracken Snare Ring

## Enemies / Targets
- Gully Hook-Runners
- Bracken Snare Captain's snares

## Items Involved
- Sapstring Bandage
- Resin Patch Kit
- Chorus Bridge Torch
- Roadling Trade Token

## Turn-in Dialogue
- Ellas taps the bandages, testing the wrap. 
- "Good pull. These will keep the straps from bleeding us dry."
- "You even burned snares? That's fewer mules limping."
- He slides a **Warden's Sapsteel Buckle** across the counter. 
- "Take this and a **Crossing Guard's Satchel**. Keep the road quiet and I'll keep paying." 
- "If you hear the Milepost Whisperer again, tell him we're watching." 

## Rewards
- Choice of: **Warden's Sapsteel Buckle** or **Crossing Guard's Satchel**
- Consumables: **Sap-Resin Salve** x2, **Whisperline Travel Ration** x2
- Reputation: Whisperline Wardens (small)

## Artifact Tie
- [Artifact Bundle 01 — Warden Supply Tag](../../09_Artifacts/Generated_Batches/2026-01-04_SIGMA_Greatwood_Whisperline/Artifact_Bundle_01.md#a-002-warden-supply-tag)

## Implementation Notes
- Place 3 bandage caches near the Milepost; respawn every 5 minutes.
- Patch kits drop from broken crates at **Fallen Cart Bend** with 60% chance each.
- Snares at **Bracken Snare Ring** ignite when hit by a **Chorus Bridge Torch** effect; count toward optional objective.
- Hook-runners should prioritize packs; losing a pack applies a slow until recovered.
