# Wardstone Echoes

- Quest Giver: Peddler Jessa Coil — Chorus Bridge Rope Rail
- Recommended Level: 7
- Prerequisites: Completion of Q04_Bracken_Bridge_Ambush

## Acceptance Dialogue
- Jessa taps a chalk nub against her teeth. "The wardstone hum jumps when storms roll. My ropes shake with it."
- "Ellas keeps yelling about grooves fading. Ril just smears soot. Neither fixes the song."
- "I need someone to re-trace the marks with fresh chalk and test horn tones."
- "Bring tea to dampen the chalk dust; Mara insists it keeps the hum steady."
- "Leave the ribbon near Fen's post exactly like the note says."
- "If wisps drift close, hum low. They hate sharp whistles." 

## Objectives
- Refresh grooves at Murmur Wardstone with 4 Ward-Chalk Packets.
- Sound the Rootsong Listening Horn at Rootsong Cairn in three spots.
- Replace the tarred ribbon at Whisperline Milepost.

## Locations Used
- Murmur Wardstone
- Rootsong Cairn
- Whisperline Milepost

## Enemies / Targets
- Cairnbound Wisp
- Milepost Whisperer

## Items Involved
- Ward-Chalk Packet
- Rootsong Listening Horn
- Milepost Tarred Ribbon (Artifact A-029)

## Turn-in Dialogue
- "You heard it too? The low hum under the bridge song?"
- "These chalk lines look straight. Ellas owes you a nod for this."
- "Ribbon's back up? Good. Fen stops panicking when the tar smells fresh."
- "Take this coil. It holds chalk tight even when the wind claws."
- "If the wisps come back, dip the chalk in tea again."
- "Come back when the next storm builds; we'll retune the grooves together."

## Rewards
- 1x Coiled Line Spool
- 2x Lowlight Shroom Tea
- Reputation: +85 with Whisperline Ropehands

## Rumor Tie
- RW-108

## Artifact Tie
- Artifact_Bundle_03.md#a-026-murmur-wardstone-chalk-rub

## Implementation Notes
- Chalk interaction at wardstone consumes packets; each groove requires one use.
- Horn use spawns visual hum rings; requires standing on marked cairn points.
- Ribbon replacement uses item pickup at milepost sapling; respawns after completion.
- Wisps spawn when horn is blown; moderate threat for level band.
- Failure if player leaves area during horn sequence; progress resets to last completed tone.
