[Back to Hub](../Greatwood_Whisperline_Hub.md)

## Hook
Archivist Pellan experiments with brew swaps between the Hearthpost and the Luminarium. He needs help trading teas without alerting smugglers.

## Objectives
1. Purchase **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Sap Tea** from **Sapbroker Neral** and **2026-01-04_SIGMA Shrinesafe Sap Tea** from **Wardscribe Istra**.
2. Deliver both teas to the Luminarium bench and pour them over the runes detailed in **2026-01-04_SIGMA_Whisperline_Artifact_44.md**.
3. Return with a cooled **2026-01-04_SIGMA Whisperline Resin Draught** sample for Pellan.

## Where It Happens
- Whisperline Hearthpost, Root-Song Shrine, Sapswell Luminarium.

## Rewards
- XP, coin, archive favor.
- Items: **2026-01-04_SIGMA Lumenwoven Hood**, **2026-01-04_SIGMA Rootbound Sap Flake**.

## Ties
