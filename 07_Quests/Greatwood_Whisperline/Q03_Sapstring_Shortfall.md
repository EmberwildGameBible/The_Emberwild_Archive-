# Sapstring Shortfall

- Quest Giver: Warden Quartermaster Ellas — Sapstring Crossing (Plankstore)
- Recommended Level: 5
- Prerequisites: None

## Acceptance Dialogue
- Ellas flicks resin off a ledger. "Sapstring jars went light again. If the bridge torches gutter, folk blame me."
- "Cook Mara swears the ferry-runner's sap pouch came back empty. I smell smugglers skimming."
- "We keep the road open with chalk and patience. Bring back what was shaved, and we'll keep singing the bridge songs."
- "Take this tally slate; it lists what each patrol should carry."
- "If you spot Ril's ash pits smoking, scrape a sample. I need proof to wave in his face."
- "Return before dusk. Fen closes tolls when the fog creeps." 

## Objectives
- Recover 6 Sapstring Bandages from patrol caches at Chorus Bridge and Sapstring Crossing.
- Collect 3 Resin Patch Kits hidden at Smuggler's Knot Camp.
- Gather 1 Ferry-Runner's Sap Pouch Tag as proof of siphoning.

## Locations Used
- Sapstring Crossing

## Turn-in Dialogue
- "You brought back more than I logged. Good. I'll make Ril squirm."
- "These bandages are still warm. Mara will be pleased her ferry isn't blamed."
- "The pouch tag is stamped—proof enough for Fen to waive tolls tonight."
- "Here's your cut. Spend it on chalk, not ale."
- "If you hear the hum shift at the cairn, come back quick."
- "Road's thin as a fiddle string; thanks for keeping it tight."

## Rumor Tie
- RW-082

## Artifact Tie
- Artifact_Bundle_03.md#a-022-ferry-runner-s-sap-pouch-tag

## Implementation Notes
- Place bandage crates near bridge planks and camp bedrolls; interact to loot.
- Spawn Bracken Snare Captain near the ash pit; defeating him enables crate access.
- Ferry-Runner's Sap Pouch Tag drops from a smuggler runner in the camp.
- Progress tracks per item, shared across party; respawn timers 3–5 minutes.
- Failing to return before player logout keeps partial progress.
