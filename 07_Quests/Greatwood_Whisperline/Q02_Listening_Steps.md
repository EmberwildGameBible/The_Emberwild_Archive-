## Artifact Tie
- [Artifact Bundle 01 — Cairnkeeper Chant Note](../../09_Artifacts/Generated_Batches/2026-01-04_SIGMA_Greatwood_Whisperline/Artifact_Bundle_01.md#a-004-cairnkeeper-chant-note)

## Implementation Notes
- Listening horn purchasable from Ril or Jessa Coil; rare drop from Milepost Whisperer.
- Ward-chalk interaction requires emote at three grooves; each groove hums when aligned.
- Escort: Roadling Fen follows slow path; bridge ropes can break if hooks hit them—use **Coiled Line Spools** to repair mid-run.
- Success grants temporary ward resistance buff for party.
