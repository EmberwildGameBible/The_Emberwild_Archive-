# Hymn of the Sapswell
[Back to Hub](../Greatwood_Whisperline_Hub.md)

## Hook
The Sapswell Luminarium pulses off-tempo, warping nearby ward chalk. Wardscribe Istra needs you to re-tune the basin before smugglers steal its glow for fake permit seals.

## Objectives
1. Speak with **Wardscribe Istra** at Root-Song Shrine to receive a tuned **2026-01-04_SIGMA Shrinesafe Signal Chalk**.
2. Collect 3 **2026-01-04_SIGMA Sapsong Sap Tea** infusions from Sapsong Crossing singers.
3. Apply the chalk at three marked stones around Sapswell Luminarium while holding **2026-01-04_SIGMA Rootbound Resin Thread** to anchor the song.

## Where It Happens
- Root-Song Shrine for briefing.
- Sapswell Luminarium chalk circles.

## Rewards
- XP, coin, shrine favor.
- Items: **2026-01-04_SIGMA Shrinesafe Sap Tea**, **2026-01-04_SIGMA Rootbound Hood**.

## Ties
- Artifact: **2026-01-04_SIGMA_Whisperline_Artifact_22.md** (describes the basin pulse).
- Rumor: **RW-041**.

## Implementation Notes
- Chalk placements must occur in order; use waypoint markers and timers to enforce tempo.
- Tea infusions function as consumables; require active buff to interact with chalk stones.
- Failure to keep the buff active resets the chalk sequence to step one.
