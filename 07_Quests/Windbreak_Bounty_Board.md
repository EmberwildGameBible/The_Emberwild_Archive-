# Windbreak Bounty Board

Rotating patrol and repair postings at the Windbreak Palisade.

- Origin/Provenance: Maintained by Scout Rinna to keep lantern lines lit and salt gnat swarms in check.
- Cultural tie: Watch crews leave carved wooden wind-charms when they finish a shift, a quiet boast nailed to the post.
- Gameplay hook: Tasks include lighting braziers, placing [Brineglass Vent Caps](../08_Items/Crafting/Brineglass_Vent_Caps.md), and crafting [Gnat-Smother Salve](../08_Items/Crafting/Gnat-Smother_Salve.md); rewards reputation with Hookbite Lookout.
- See also: [Saltmarrow Strand](../02_Regions/Saltmarrow_Strand/Saltmarrow_Strand.md), [Hookbite Signal Flares](../08_Items/Gear/Hookbite_Signal_Flares.md), [Saltmarrow Ledger Chain](../09_Artifacts/Saltmarrow_Ledger_Chain.md).
